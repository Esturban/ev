*the Mozart legend. Just seven years old and barely tall enough to see over the top of a harpsichord,*  

- Page 4 (location ~ 61-62)    

*The letter writer reported that when the young Mozart heard a note played on a musical instrument—any note—he could immediately identify exactly which note it was: the A-sharp in the second octave above middle C, perhaps, or the E-flat below middle C. Mozart could do this even if he was in another room and could not see the instrument being played, and he could do it not just for the violin and fortepiano but for every instrument he heard—and Mozart’s father, as a composer and music teacher, had nearly every imaginable musical instrument in his house. Nor was it just musical instruments. The boy could identify the notes produced by anything that was sufficiently musical—the chime of a clock, the toll of a bell, the ah-choo of a sneeze. It was an ability that most adult musicians of the time, even the most experienced, could not match, and it seemed, even more than Mozart’s skill on keyboard and violin, to be an example of the mysterious gifts that this young prodigy had been born with. That ability is not quite so mysterious to us today, of course. We know a good deal more about it now than 250 years ago, and most people today have at least heard of it. The technical term is “absolute pitch,” although it is better known as “perfect pitch,” and it is exceptionally rare—only about one in every ten thousand people has it. It is much less rare among world-class musicians than among the rest of us, but even among virtuosos it is far from normal: Beethoven is thought to have had it; Brahms did not. Vladimir Horowitz had it; Igor Stravinsky did not. Frank Sinatra had it; Miles Davis did not.*

*The first hint emerged with the observation that the only people who had received this “gift” had also received some sort of musical training early in their childhood. In particular, a good deal of research has shown that nearly everyone with perfect pitch began musical training at a very young age—generally around three to five years old. But if perfect pitch is an innate ability, something that you are either born with or not, then it shouldn’t make any difference whether you receive music training as a child. All that should matter is that you get enough musical training—at any time in your life—to learn the names of the notes. The next clue appeared when researchers noticed that perfect pitch is much more common among people who speak a tonal language, such as Mandarin, Vietnamese, and several other Asian tongues, in which the meaning of words is dependent on their pitch. If perfect pitch is indeed a genetic gift, then the only way that the tonal-language connection would make sense would be if people of Asian ancestry are more likely to have genes for perfect pitch than people whose ancestors came from elsewhere, such as Europe or Africa. But that is something that is easy to test for. You just recruit a number of people of Asian ancestry who grew up speaking English or some other nontonal language and see if they are more likely to have perfect pitch. That research has been done, and it turns out that people of Asian heritage who don’t grow up speaking a tonal language are no more likely than people of other ethnicities to have perfect pitch. So it’s not the Asian genetic heritage but rather learning a tonal language that makes having perfect pitch more likely.*

*The true character of perfect pitch was revealed in 2014, thanks to a beautiful experiment carried out at the Ichionkai Music School in Tokyo and reported in the scientific journal Psychology of Music. The Japanese psychologist Ayako Sakakibara recruited twenty-four children between the ages of two and six and put them through a months-long training course designed to teach them to identify, simply by their sound, various chords played on the piano. The chords were all major chords with three notes, such as a C-major chord with middle C and the E and G notes immediately above middle C. The children were given four or five short training sessions per day, each lasting just a few minutes, and each child continued training until he or she could identify all fourteen of the target chords that Sakakibara had selected. Some of the children completed the training in less than a year, while others took as long as a year and a half. Then, once a child had learned to identify the fourteen chords, Sakakibara tested that child to see if he or she could correctly name individual notes. After completing training every one of the children in the study had developed perfect pitch and could identify individual notes played on the piano. This is an astonishing result. While in normal circumstances only one in every ten thousand people develops perfect pitch, every single one of Sakakibara’s students did. The clear implication is that perfect pitch, far from being a gift bestowed upon only a lucky few, is an ability that pretty much anyone can develop with the right exposure and training. The study has completely rewritten our understanding of perfect pitch.*

*Only recently have neuroscientists come to understand why such a gift should exist. For decades scientists believed that we were born with our brains’ circuits pretty much fixed and that this circuitry determined our abilities. Either your brain was wired for perfect pitch, or it wasn’t, and there wasn’t much you could do to change it. You might need a certain amount of practice to bring that innate talent into full bloom, and if you didn’t get this practice, your perfect pitch might never develop fully, but the general belief was that no amount of practice would help if you didn’t have the right genes to start with. But since the 1990s brain researchers have come to realize that the brain—even the adult brain—is far more adaptable than anyone ever imagined, and this gives us a tremendous amount of control over what our brains are able to do. In particular, the brain responds to the right sorts of triggers by rewiring itself in various ways.*  

- Page 9 (location ~ 128-135)    

*Still, both the brain and the body retain a great deal of adaptability throughout adulthood, and this adaptability makes it possible for adults, even older adults, to develop a wide variety of new capabilities with the right training. With this truth in mind, let’s return to the question that I asked at the beginning: Why are some people so amazingly good at what they do? Over my years of studying experts in various fields, I have found that they all develop their abilities in much the same way that Sakakibara’s students did—through dedicated training that drives changes in the brain (and sometimes, depending on the ability, in the body) that make it possible for them to do things that they otherwise could not. Yes, in some cases genetic endowment makes a difference, particularly in areas where height or other physical factors are important. A man with genes for being five feet five will find it tough to become a professional basketball player, just as a six-foot woman will find it virtually impossible to succeed as an artistic gymnast at the international level. And, as we will discuss later in this book, there are other ways in which genes may influence one’s achievements, particularly those genes that influence how likely a person is to practice diligently and correctly. But the clear message from decades of research is that no matter what role innate genetic endowment may play in the achievements of “gifted” people, the main gift that these people have is the same one we all have—the adaptability of the human brain and body, which they have taken advantage of more than the rest of us.*

*One of my favorite testimonies on this topic came from Ray Allen, a ten-time All-Star in the National Basketball Association and the greatest three-point shooter in the history of that league. Some years back, ESPN columnist Jackie MacMullan wrote an article about Allen as he was approaching his record for most three-point shots made. In talking with Allen for that story, MacMullan mentioned that another basketball commentator had said that Allen was born with a shooting touch—in other words, an innate gift for three-pointers. Allen did not agree. “I’ve argued this with a lot of people in my life,” he told MacMullan. “When people say God blessed me with a beautiful jump shot, it really pisses me off. I tell those people, ‘Don’t undermine the work I’ve put in every day.’ Not some days. Every day. Ask anyone who has been on a team with me who shoots the most. Go back to Seattle and Milwaukee, and ask them. The answer is me.” And, indeed, as MacMullan noted, if you talk to Allen’s high school basketball coach you will find that Allen’s jump shot was not noticeably better than his teammates’ jump shots back then; in fact, it was poor. But Allen took control, and over time, with hard work and dedication, he transformed his jump shot into one so graceful and natural that people assumed he was born with it. He took advantage of his gift—his real gift.*

*In this new world it no longer makes sense to think of people as born with fixed reserves of potential; instead, potential is an expandable vessel, shaped by the various things we do throughout our lives. Learning isn’t a way of reaching one’s potential but rather a way of developing it. We can create our own potential. And this is true whether our goal is to become a concert pianist or just play the piano well enough to amuse ourselves, to join the PGA golf tour or just bring our handicaps down a few strokes.*

*Over the past few years a number of books have argued that people have been overestimating the value of innate talent and underestimating the value of such things as opportunity, motivation, and effort. I cannot disagree with this, and it is certainly important to let people know that they can improve—and improve a lot—with practice, or else they are unlikely to be motivated to even try. But sometimes these books leave the impression that heartfelt desire and hard work alone will lead to improved performance—“Just keep working at it, and you’ll get there”—and this is wrong. The right sort of practice carried out over a sufficient period of time leads to improvement. Nothing else. This book describes in detail what that “right sort of practice” is and how it can be put to work.*

*Next, in a brief interlude, we examine more closely the issue of innate endowment and what role it might play in limiting how far some people can go in attaining expert performance. There are some inherited physical characteristics, such as height and body size, that can influence performance in various sports and other physical activities and that cannot be changed by practice. However, most traits that play a role in expert performance can be modified by the right sort of practice, at least during some period of one’s lifespan. More generally, there is a complex interplay between genetic factors and practice activities that we are just beginning to understand. Some genetic factors may influence a person’s ability to engage in sustained deliberate practice—for instance, by limiting a person’s capability to focus for long periods of time every day. Conversely, engaging in extended practice may influence how genes are turned on and off in the body. The last part of the book takes everything we have learned about deliberate practice by studying expert performers and explains what it means for the rest of us. I offer specific advice about putting deliberate practice to work in professional organizations in order to improve the performance of employees, about how individuals can apply deliberate practice to get better in their areas of interest, and even about how schools can put deliberate practice to work in the classroom. While the principles of deliberate*

*In 1908 Johnny Hayes won the Olympic marathon in what newspapers at the time described as “the greatest race of the century.” Hayes’s winning time, which set a world record for the marathon, was 2 hours, 55 minutes, and 18 seconds. Today, barely more than a century later, the world record for a marathon is 2 hours, 2 minutes, and 57 seconds—nearly 30 percent faster than Hayes’s record time—and if you’re an eighteen- to thirty-four-year-old male, you aren’t even allowed to enter the Boston Marathon unless you’ve run another marathon in less than 3 hours, 5 minutes. In short, Hayes’s world-record time in 1908 would qualify him for today’s Boston Marathon (which has about thirty thousand runners) but with not a lot to spare. That same 1908 Summer Olympics saw a near disaster in the men’s diving competition. One of the divers barely avoided serious injury while attempting a double somersault, and an official report released a few months later concluded that the dive was simply too dangerous and recommended that it be banned from future Olympic Games. Today the double somersault is an entry-level dive, with ten-year-olds nailing it in competitions, and by high school the best divers are doing four and a half somersaults. World-class competitors take it even further with dives such as “the Twister”—two and a half backward somersaults with two and a half twists added. It’s difficult to imagine what those early-twentieth-century experts who found the double-somersault dive too dangerous would have thought about the Twister, but my guess is that they would have dismissed it as laughably impossible—assuming, that is, that someone would have had the imagination and the audacity to suggest it in the first place. In the early 1930s Alfred Cortot was one of the best-known classical musicians in the world, and his recordings of Chopin’s “24 Études” were considered the definitive interpretation.*

*In 1973 David Richard Spencer of Canada had memorized more digits of pi than any person before him: 511. Five years later, after a rapid-fire series of new records set by a handful of people competing to claim the memorization title, the record belonged to an American, David Sanker, who had committed 10,000 digits of pi to memory. In 2015, after another thirty-plus years of gains, the recognized title holder was Rajveer Meena of India, who had memorized the first 70,000 digits of pi—an accumulation that took him 24 hours and 4 minutes to recite—although Akira Haraguchi of Japan had claimed to have memorized an even more incredible 100,000 digits, or nearly two hundred times as many as anyone had memorized just forty-two years earlier. These are not isolated examples. We live in a world full of people with extraordinary abilities—abilities that from the vantage point of almost any other time in human history would have been deemed impossible. Consider Roger Federer’s magic with a tennis ball, or the astounding vault that McKayla Maroney nailed in the 2012 Summer Olympics: a round-off onto the springboard, a back handspring onto the vault, and then a high, arching flight with McKayla completing two and a half twists before she landed firmly and with complete control on the mat. There are chess grandmasters who can play several dozen different games simultaneously—while blindfolded—and a seemingly unending supply of young musical prodigies who can do things on the piano, the violin, the cello, or the flute that would have astonished aficionados a century ago.*

*What the second half of the twentieth century did see was a steady increase in the amount of time that people in different areas devoted to training, combined with a growing sophistication of training techniques. This was true in a huge number of fields, particularly highly competitive fields such as musical performance and dance, individual and team sports, and chess and other competitive games. This increase in the amount and sophistication of practice resulted in a steady improvement in the abilities of the performers in these various fields—an improvement that was not always obvious from year to year but that is dramatic when viewed over the course of several decades. One of the best, if sometimes bizarre, places to see the results of this sort of practice is in Guinness World Records. Flip through the pages of the book or visit the online version, and you will find such record holders as the American teacher Barbara Blackburn, who can type up to 212 words per minute; Marko Baloh of Slovenia, who once rode 562 miles on a bicycle in twenty-four hours; and Vikas Sharma of India, who in just one minute was able to calculate the roots of twelve large numbers, each with between twenty and fifty-one digits, with the roots ranging from the seventeenth to the fiftieth root. That last may be the most impressive of all of them because Sharma was able to perform twelve exceedingly difficult mental calculations in just sixty seconds—faster than many people could punch the numbers into a calculator and read off the answers.*

*Why should the teaching techniques used to turn aspiring musicians into concert pianists have anything to do with the training that a dancer must go through to become a prima ballerina or the study that a chess player must undertake to become a grandmaster? The answer is that the most effective and most powerful types of practice in any field work by harnessing the adaptability of the human body and brain to create, step by step, the ability to do things that were previously not possible. If you wish to develop a truly effective training method for anything—creating world-class gymnasts, for instance, or even something like teaching doctors to perform laparoscopic surgery—that method will need to take into account what works and what doesn’t in driving changes in the body and brain. Thus, all truly effective practice techniques work in essentially the same way. These insights are all relatively new and weren’t available to all the teachers, coaches, and performers who produced the incredible improvements in performance that have occurred over the past century. Instead, these advances were all accomplished through trial and error, with the people involved having essentially no idea why a particular training method might be effective.*

*But there is one very important thing to understand here: once you have reached this satisfactory skill level and automated your performance—your driving, your tennis playing, your baking of pies—you have stopped improving. People often misunderstand this because they assume that the continued driving or tennis playing or pie baking is a form of practice and that if they keep doing it they are bound to get better at it, slowly perhaps, but better nonetheless. They assume that someone who has been driving for twenty years must be a better driver than someone who has been driving for five, that a doctor who has been practicing medicine for twenty years must be a better doctor than one who has been practicing for five, that a teacher who has been teaching for twenty years must be better than one who has been teaching for five. But no. Research has shown that, generally speaking, once a person reaches that level of “acceptable” performance and automaticity, the additional years of “practice” don’t lead to improvement. If anything, the doctor or the teacher or the driver who’s been at it for twenty years is likely to be a bit worse than the one who’s been doing it for only five, and the reason is that these automated abilities gradually deteriorate in the absence of deliberate efforts to improve.*

*Purposeful practice has several characteristics that set it apart from what we might call “naive practice,” which is essentially just doing something repeatedly, and expecting that the repetition alone will improve one’s performance. Steve Oare, a specialist in music education at Wichita State University, once offered the following imaginary conversation between a music instructor and a young music student. It’s the sort of conversation about practice that music instructors have all the time. In this case*

It’s the sort of conversation about practice that music instructors have all the time.*  

- Page 29 (location ~ 431-434)    

*Purposeful practice is, as the term implies, much more purposeful, thoughtful, and focused than this sort of naive practice. In particular, it has the following characteristics: Purposeful practice has well-defined, specific goals. Our hypothetical music student would have been much more successful with a practice goal something like this: “Play the piece all the way through at the proper speed without a mistake three times in a row.” Without such a goal, there was no way to judge whether the practice session had been a success. In Steve’s case there was no long-range goal because none of us knew how many digits one could possibly memorize, but he had a very specific short-term goal: to remember more digits than he had the previous session. As a distance runner, Steve was very competitive, even if he was only competing with himself, and he brought that attitude to the experiment. From the very beginning Steve was pushing each day to increase the number of digits he could remember.*  

- Page 29 (location ~ 445-452)    

*practice is all about putting a bunch of baby steps together to reach a longer-term goal.*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 452-453)    

*If you’re a weekend golfer and you want to decrease your handicap by five strokes, that’s fine for an overall purpose, but it is not a well-defined, specific goal that can be used effectively for your practice. Break it down and make a plan: What exactly do you need to do to slice five strokes off your handicap? One goal might be to increase the number of drives landing in the fairway. That’s a reasonably specific goal, but you need to break it down even more: What exactly will you do to increase the number of successful drives? You will need to figure out why so many of your drives are not landing in the fairway and address that by, for instance, working to reduce your tendency to hook the ball. How do you do that? An instructor can give you advice on how to change your swing motion in specific ways. And so on. The key thing is to take that general goal—get better—and turn it into something specific that you can work on with a realistic expectation of improvement. Purposeful practice is focused. Unlike the music student that Oare described, Steve Faloon was focused on his task from the very beginning, and his focus grew as the experiment went along and he was memorizing longer and longer strings of digits. You can get a sense of this focus by listening to the tape of session 115, which came about halfway through the study.*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 453-462)    

*Now, not everyone will focus by hollering and pounding on a table, but Steve’s performance illustrates a key insight from the study of effective practice: You seldom improve much without giving the task your full attention. Purposeful practice involves feedback. You have to know whether you are doing something right and, if not, how you’re going wrong. In Oare’s example the music student got belated feedback at school with a C on the performance test, but there seems to have been no feedback during practice—no one listening and pointing out mistakes, with the student seemingly clueless about whether there were errors in the practice. (“How many times did you play it correctly?” “Umm, I dunno . . . Once or twice . . .”)*  

- Page 31 (location ~ 473-478)    

*Purposeful practice requires getting out of one’s comfort zone. This is perhaps the most important part of purposeful practice. Oare’s music student shows no sign of ever pushing himself beyond what was familiar and comfortable. Instead, the student’s words seem to imply a rather desultory attempt at practice, with no effort to do more than what was already easy for him. That approach just doesn’t work. Our memory experiment was set up to keep Steve from getting too comfortable. As he increased his memory capacity, I would challenge him with longer and longer strings of digits so that he was always close to his capacity. In particular, by increasing the number of digits each time he got a string right, and decreasing the number when he got it wrong, I kept the number of digits right around what he was capable of doing while always pushing him to remember just one more digit. This is a fundamental truth about any sort of practice: If you never push yourself beyond your comfort zone, you will never improve. The amateur pianist who took half a dozen years of lessons when he was a teenager but who for the past thirty years has been playing the same set of songs in exactly the same way over and over again may have accumulated ten thousand hours of “practice” during that time, but he is no better at playing the piano than he was thirty years ago. Indeed, he’s probably gotten worse.*  

- Page 32 (location ~ 486-496)    

*Perhaps my favorite example of this lesson is the case of Ben Franklin’s chess skills. Franklin was America’s first famous genius. He was a scientist who made his reputation with his studies of electricity, a popular writer and publisher of Poor Richard’s Almanack, the founder of the first public lending library in America, an accomplished diplomat, and the inventor of, among other things, bifocals, the lightning rod, and the Franklin stove. But his greatest passion was chess. He was one of the first chess players in America, and he was a participant in the earliest game of chess known to have been played here. He played chess for more than fifty years, and as he got older he spent more and more time on it. While in Europe he played with François-André Danican Philidor, the best chess player of the time. And despite his well-known advice to be early to bed and early to rise, Franklin regularly played from around 6:00 p.m. until sunrise. So Ben Franklin was brilliant, and he spent thousands of hours playing chess, sometimes against the best players of the time. Did that make him a great chess player? No. He was above average, but he never got good enough to compare with Europe’s better players, much less the best. This failing was a source of great frustration to him, but he had no idea why he couldn’t get any better. Today we understand: he never pushed himself, never got out of his comfort zone, never put in the hours of purposeful practice it would take to improve. He was like the pianist playing the same songs the same way for thirty years. That is a recipe for stagnation, not improvement. Getting out of your comfort zone means trying to do something that you couldn’t do before. Sometimes you may find it relatively easy to accomplish that new thing, and then you keep pushing on. But sometimes you run into something that stops you cold and it seems like you’ll never be able to*

*Generally the solution is not “try harder” but rather “try differently.” It is a technique issue, in other words. In Steve’s case, one barrier came when he hit twenty-two digits. He was grouping them into four four-digit groups, which he used various mnemonic tricks to remember, plus a six-digit rehearsal group at the end that he would repeat over and over to himself until he could remember it by the sound of the numbers. But he couldn’t figure out how to get past twenty-two digits, because when he tried to hold five four-digit groups in his head, he became confused about their order.*  

- Page 34 (location ~ 516-520)    

*The best way to get past any barrier is to come at it from a different direction, which is one reason it is useful to work with a teacher or coach. Someone who is already familiar with the sorts of obstacles you’re likely to encounter can suggest ways to overcome them. And sometimes it turns out that a barrier is more psychological than anything else. The famous violin teacher Dorothy DeLay once described the time that one of her students came to her to help increase his speed on a particular piece that he was scheduled to play at a music festival. He could not play it fast enough, he told her. How fast, she asked, would you like to play it? He answered that he wanted to play it as fast as Itzhak Perlman, the world-famous violinist. So DeLay first got a recording of Perlman playing the piece and timed it. Then she set a metronome to a slow speed and had her student play the piece at that pace, which was well within his abilities. She had him play it again and again, each time speeding up the metronome a bit. And each time he nailed it. Finally, after he had gone through the piece flawlessly once more, she showed him the setting on the metronome: He had actually played it faster than Perlman.*  

- Page 35 (location ~ 525-533)    

*From talking to him, I believe that a large part of it was that once he started to see improvement after the first few sessions, he really enjoyed seeing his memory scores go up. It felt good, and he wanted to keep feeling that way. Also, after he reached a certain level in his memorization abilities, he became something of a celebrity; stories about him appeared in newspapers and magazines, and he made a number of appearances on television, including the Today show. This provided another type of positive feedback. Generally speaking, meaningful positive feedback is one of the crucial factors in maintaining motivation. It can be internal feedback, such as the satisfaction of seeing yourself improve at something, or external feedback provided by others, but it makes a huge difference in whether a person will be able to maintain the consistent effort necessary to improve through purposeful practice. One other factor was that Steve liked to challenge himself. This was clear from his record as a cross-country and track runner. Everyone who knew him would tell you that he trained as hard as anyone but that his motivation was simply to improve his own performance, not necessarily to win races.*

*One key difference between Steve and Renée was that Steve had always decided ahead of time what pattern he would use in memorizing the digits, breaking the strings into three- and four-digit sets plus a group at the end with four to six digits that he would repeat to himself over and over until he had the sound of it in his memory. For twenty-seven digits, for instance, he would organize the digits into three sets of four digits each, three sets of three digits each, and then a six-digit group at the end. We referred to this pre-fixed pattern as a “retrieval structure,” and it allowed Steve to focus on memorizing the three- and four-digit sets individually and then keep in mind where in the retrieval structure each of these individual sets fit. This proved to be a very powerful approach, as it allowed him to encode each set of three or four digits as a running time or some other mnemonic, put it in his long-term memory, and then not have to think about it again until he went back at the end to recall all of the digits in the string. Renée, by contrast, devised her mnemonics on the fly, deciding according to the digits she heard what mnemonic she would use to remember them. For a string like 4778245 she might remember it as April 7, 1978 at 2:45, but if the string was 4778295, she would have to use April 7, 1978 and then start a new date: February 9 . . . Without the sort*

Without the sort of consistency that Steve’s approach offered, she could not master more than twenty digits.*

*There is an important lesson here: Although it is generally possible to improve to a certain degree with focused practice and staying out of your comfort zone, that’s not all there is to it. Trying hard isn’t enough. Pushing yourself to your limits isn’t enough. There are other, equally important aspects to practice and training that are often overlooked. One particular approach to practice and training has proven to be the most powerful and effective way to improve one’s abilities in every area that has been studied. This approach is deliberate practice, and we will describe it in detail shortly. But first we’ll take a closer look at what is behind the amazing sorts of improvement that are possible with the right sort of practice.*

*There is a growing body of evidence that both the structure and the function of the brain change in response to various sorts of mental training, in much the same way as your muscles and cardiovascular system respond to physical training. With the help of such brain-imaging techniques as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroscientists have begun to study how the brains of people with particular skills differ from the brains of people without those skills and to explore which sorts of training produce which types of changes.*

*Few cities in the world can baffle a GPS system like London can. To start with, there is no grid of thoroughfares that can be used for orientation and routing as you will find in Manhattan or Paris or Tokyo. Instead the city’s major streets are set at odd angles to each other. They curve and they squiggle. One-way streets abound, there are traffic circles and dead ends all over, and through the middle of everything runs the Thames River, spanned by a dozen bridges in central London, at least one of which—and sometimes more—will likely have to be crossed during a trip of any length through the city. And the erratic numbering system doesn’t always tell you exactly where to find a particular address even when you’ve found the right street.*

*As you might imagine, given the challenges of finding one’s way in London, not just anyone can be a cabbie. Indeed, to become a licensed London taxi driver one must pass a series of examinations that have been described as, collectively, the most difficult test in the world. The test is administered by Transport for London, and that agency describes “the Knowledge”—what a prospective driver must learn—as follows: To achieve the required standard to be licensed as an “All London” taxi driver you will need a thorough knowledge, primarily, of the area within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross. You will need to know: all the streets; housing estates; parks and open spaces; government offices and departments; financial and commercial centres; diplomatic premises; town halls; registry offices; hospitals; places of worship; sports stadiums and leisure centres; airline offices; stations; hotels; clubs; theatres; cinemas; museums; art galleries; schools; colleges and universities; police stations and headquarters buildings; civil, criminal and coroner’s courts; prisons; and places of interest to tourists. In fact, anywhere a taxi passenger might ask to be taken. That area within six miles of Charing Cross contains approximately twenty-five thousand streets. But a prospective cabbie must be familiar with more than just streets and buildings. Any landmark is fair game.*  

- Page 43 (location ~ 649-659)    

*To master the Knowledge, prospective cabbies—who are known as “Knowledge boys” and, occasionally, “Knowledge girls”—spend years driving from place to place in London, making notes of what is where and how to get from here to there. The first step is to master a list of 320 runs in the guidebook provided to taxi-driver candidates. For a given run, a candidate will generally first figure out the shortest route by physically traveling the various possible routes, usually by motorbike, and then will explore the areas around the beginning and the end of the run. This means wandering around within a quarter mile or so of each of those places, taking notes on which buildings and which landmarks are in the vicinity. After having repeated this process 320 times, the prospective cabbie has accumulated a foundational set of 320 best routes around London and has also explored—and taken notes on—pretty much every bit of the core area within six miles of Charing Cross. It is a start, but successful candidates keep challenging themselves to determine the best routes for many other runs that are not on the list and to take note of buildings and landmarks that they might have missed before or that might have recently appeared. Indeed, even after passing all the tests and getting licensed, London taxi drivers continue to increase and hone their knowledge of London’s streets. The resulting memory and navigational skills are nothing short of astonishing, and so London taxi drivers have proved irresistible to psychologists interested in learning and, particularly, in the learning of navigational skills. By far the most in-depth studies of the cabbies—and the ones that have the most to tell us about how training affects the brain—have been carried out by Eleanor Maguire, a neuroscientist at University College London.*  

- Page 44 (location ~ 668-681)    

*Maguire used magnetic resonance imaging to look at the brains of sixteen male taxi drivers and compare them with the brains of fifty other males of similar ages who were not taxi drivers. She looked in particular at the hippocampus, that seahorse-shaped part of the brain involved in the development of memories. The hippocampus is particularly engaged by spatial navigation and in remembering the location of things in space. (Each person actually has two hippocampi, one on each side of the brain.) For instance, species of birds that store food in different places and thus must be able to remember the location of these various caches have relatively larger hippocampi than closely related birds that don’t store food in different places. More to the point, the size of the hippocampus is quite flexible in at least some species of birds and can grow by as much as 30 percent in response to a bird’s food-storing experiences. But would the same thing be true in humans? Maguire found that a particular part of the hippocampus—the posterior, or rear, part—was larger in the taxi drivers than in the other subjects. Furthermore, the more time that a person had spent as a taxi driver, the larger the posterior hippocampi were. In another study that Maguire carried out a few years later, she compared the brains of London taxi drivers with London bus drivers. Like the taxi drivers, the bus drivers spent their days driving around London; the difference between them was that the bus drivers repeated the same routes over and over and thus never had to figure out the best way to get from point A to point B. Maguire found that the posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers were significantly larger than the same parts of the brain in the bus drivers. The clear implication was that whatever was responsible for the difference in the size of the posterior hippocampi was not related to the driving itself but rather was related specifically to the navigational skills that the job required.*  

- Page 45 (location ~ 681-695)    

*Maguire’s study, which was published in 2011, is perhaps the most dramatic evidence we have that the human brain grows and changes in response to intense training. Furthermore, the clear implication of her study is that the extra neurons and other tissue in the posterior hippocampi of the licensed cabbies underlie their increased navigational capabilities. You can think about the posterior hippocampi of a London taxi driver as the neural equivalent of the massively developed arms and shoulders of a male gymnast. Years of work on the rings and pommel horse and parallel bars and floor exercises have built muscles that are exquisitely suited for the sorts of movements he performs on those different pieces of apparatus—and, indeed, that make it possible for him to do all sorts of gymnastics moves that were simply not within his reach when he began training. The posterior hippocampi of the taxi drivers are equally “bulked up,” but with brain tissue, not muscle fiber.*

*The general belief was that once a person reached adulthood, the wiring of his or her brain was pretty much fixed. Sure, everyone understood that there had to be tweaks here and there when you learned something new, but these were thought to be little more than the strengthening of some neural connections and the weakening of others, because the overall structure of the brain and its various neural networks were fixed. This idea went hand in hand with the belief that individual differences in abilities were due mainly to genetically determined differences in the brain’s wiring and that learning was just a way of fulfilling one’s genetic potential. One common metaphor depicted the brain as a computer: learning was like loading some data or installing new software—it allowed you to do some things you couldn’t do before, but your ultimate performance would always be limited by such things as the number of bytes in your random-access memory (RAM) and the power of your central processing unit (CPU).*

*One of my favorite examples of physical adaptability involves pushups. If you’re a relatively fit male in your twenties, you may be able to do 40 or 50; if you can do 100, you can impress your friends and probably win a few bets. So what might you guess is the world record for pushups—500 or 1,000? In 1980 Minoru Yoshida of Japan did 10,507 pushups nonstop. After that, Guinness World Records stopped accepting submissions for the number of pushups done with no rest periods and switched to the most pushups performed in twenty-four hours with resting allowed. In 1993 Charles Servizio of the United States set what remains the world record in that category by doing 46,001 pushups in 21 hours and 21 minutes. Or consider pull-ups. Even relatively fit guys can generally do only 10 or 15, although if you’ve really been working out, you may have worked your way up to 40 or 50. In 2014 Jan Kareš of the Czech Republic did 4,654 in twelve hours. In short, the human body is incredibly adaptable. It is not just the skeletal muscles, but also the heart, the lungs, the circulatory system, the body’s energy stores, and more—everything that goes into physical strength and stamina. There may be limits, but there is no indication that we have reached them yet.*

*To read, for example, the blind run their fingertips over the raised dots that make up the Braille alphabet. When researchers use MRI machines to watch the brains of blind subjects as they read words in Braille, one of the parts of the brain that they see lighting up is the visual cortex. In people with normal sight, the visual cortex would light up in response to input from the eyes, not the fingertips, but in the blind, the visual cortex helps them interpret the fingertip sensations they get from brushing over the groups of raised dots that make up the Braille letters.*  

- Page 49 (location ~ 747-751)    

*These studies of brain plasticity in blind subjects—and similar studies in deaf subjects—tell us that the brain’s structure and function are not fixed. They change in response to use. It is possible to shape the brain—your brain, my brain, anybody’s brain—in the ways that we desire through conscious, deliberate training.*

*The subjects were asked to spot a small image against a background that was very similar in shade to the spot; that is, there was very little contrast between the image and the background. Spotting these images required intense concentration and effort. Over time the subjects learned to more quickly and accurately determine the presence of these images. At the end of three months the subjects were tested to see what size type they could read. On average they were able to read letters that were 60 percent smaller than they could at the beginning of the training, and every single subject had improved. Furthermore, after the training every subject was able to read a newspaper without glasses, something a majority of them couldn’t do beforehand. They also were able to read faster than before. Surprisingly, none of this improvement was caused by changes in the eyes, which had the same stiffness and difficulty focusing as before. Instead, the improvement was due to changes in the part of the brain that interprets visual signals from the eye. Although the researchers couldn’t pinpoint exactly what those changes were, they believe that the brain learned to “de-blur” images.*

*Individual cells like stability as well. They maintain a certain level of water and also regulate the balance of positive and negative ions, particularly sodium and potassium ions, and various small molecules by controlling which ions and molecules stay and which exit through the cell membrane. More important to us is the fact that cells require a stable environment if they are to function effectively. If the surrounding tissues get too hot or too cold, if their fluid level moves too far outside of the preferred range, if the oxygen level drops too far, or if the energy supplies get too low, it damages the functioning of the cells. If the changes are too big for too long, the cells start to die. Thus, the body is equipped with various feedback mechanisms that act to maintain the status quo. Consider what happens when you engage in some sort of vigorous physical activity. The contraction of muscle fibers causes the individual muscle cells to expend their supplies of energy and oxygen, which are replenished from nearby blood vessels. But now the level of oxygen and energy supplies in the bloodstream drops, which leads the body to take various measures in response. The breathing rate goes up to increase oxygen levels in the blood and to clear out more carbon dioxide. Various energy stores are converted into the sort of energy supply that the muscles can use and feed into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, blood circulation increases in order to better distribute the oxygen and energy supplies to those parts of the body that need them.*

*in one study on rats the scientists conducting the study counted 112 different genes that were turned on when the workload on a particular muscle in the rear legs of the rats was sharply increased. Judging by the particular genes that were switched on, the response included such things as a change in the metabolism of the muscle cells, changes in their structure, and a change in the rate at which new muscle cells were formed. The eventual result of all of these changes was a strengthening of the rats’ muscles so that they could handle the increased workload. They had been pushed out of their comfort zone, and the muscles responded by getting strong enough to establish a new comfort zone. Homeostasis had been reestablished. This is the general pattern for how physical activity creates changes in the body: when a body system—certain muscles, the cardiovascular system, or something else—is stressed to the point that homeostasis can no longer be maintained, the body responds with changes that are intended to reestablish homeostasis. Suppose,*  

- Page 54 (location ~ 817-825)    

*This explains the importance of staying just outside your comfort zone: you need to continually push to keep the body’s compensatory changes coming, but if you push too far outside your comfort zone, you risk injuring yourself and actually setting yourself back. This, at least, is the way the body responds to physical activity. Scientists know much less about how the brain changes in response to mental challenges. One major difference between the body and the brain is that the cells in the adult brain do not generally divide and form new brain cells. There are a few exceptions, such as in the hippocampus, where new neurons can grow, but in most parts of the brain the changes that occur in response to a mental challenge—such as the contrast training used to improve people’s vision—won’t include the development of new neurons.*

*Taub’s team used a magnetoencephalograph—a machine that maps out brain activity by detecting tiny magnetic fields in the brain—to determine which parts of the subjects’ brains controlled which fingers. In particular, the experimenters would touch a subject’s individual fingers and observe which parts of the brain responded to each touch. They found that the region of the brain controlling the left hand was significantly larger in the musicians than in the nonmusicians—and, in particular, that the brain regions controlling the fingers had taken over a section of the brain region that was normally devoted to the palm. Furthermore, the earlier a musician had started to play his or her instrument, the greater the expansion was. By contrast, the researchers found no difference between the musicians and nonmusicians in the size of the region controlling the fingers of the right hand. The implication was clear: Years of practice on a stringed instrument had caused the area of the brain that controls the fingers of the left hand to gradually expand, resulting in a greater ability to control those fingers.*  

- Page 57 (location ~ 866-874)    

*The details of exactly what happens to which region of the brain can be daunting to anyone who is not trained in neuroscience, but the big picture is clear: musical training modifies the structure and function of the brain in various ways that result in an increased capacity for playing music. In other words, the most effective forms of practice are doing more than helping you learn to play a musical instrument; they are actually increasing your ability to play. With such practice you are modifying the parts of the brain you use when playing music and, in a sense, increasing your own musical “talent.”*

*Some of these studies have focused on purely intellectual skills, such as mathematical ability. For example, the inferior parietal lobule has significantly more gray matter in mathematicians than in nonmathematicians. This part of the brain is involved in mathematical calculations and in visualizing objects in space, something that is important in many areas of math. It also happens to be a part of the brain that caught the attention of the neuroscientists who examined Albert Einstein’s brain. They found that Einstein’s inferior parietal lobule was significantly larger than average and that its shape was particularly unusual, which led them to speculate that his inferior parietal lobule may have played a crucial role in his ability to perform abstract mathematical thinking. Could it be that people like Einstein are simply born with beefier-than-usual inferior parietal lobules and thus have some innate capacity to be good at mathematical thinking? You might think so, but the researchers who carried out the study on the size of that part of the brain in mathematicians and nonmathematicians found that the longer someone had worked as a mathematician, the more gray matter he or she had in the right inferior parietal lobule—which would suggest that the increased size was a product of extended mathematical thinking, not something the person was born with.*  

- Page 58 (location ~ 886-896)    

*Even in the case of what we usually think of as purely “physical skills,” such as swimming or gymnastics, the brain plays a major role because these activities require careful control of the body’s movements, and research has found that practice produces brain changes. For instance, cortical thickness, a way of measuring the amount of gray matter in a brain area, is greater in competitive divers than in nondivers in three specific regions, all of which play a role in visualizing and controlling the movements of the body. Although the specific details vary from skill to skill, the overall pattern is consistent: Regular training leads to changes in the parts of the brain that are challenged by the training. The brain adapts to these challenges by rewiring itself in ways that increase its ability to carry out the functions required by the challenges. This is the basic message that should be taken away from the research on the effects of training on the brain, but there are a few additional details that are worth noting.*  

- Page 59 (location ~ 901-908)    

*A second detail worth noting is that developing certain parts of the brain through prolonged training can come at a cost: in many cases people who have developed one skill or ability to an extraordinary degree seem to have regressed in another area. Maguire’s study of the London taxi drivers provides perhaps the best example. At the end of the four years, when the trainees had either finished the course and become licensed drivers or had stopped trying, she tested her subjects’ memory in two ways. One involved knowing the locations of various London landmarks, and at this the subjects who had become licensed drivers did far better than the rest of the subjects. The second was a standard test of spatial memory—remembering a complex figure after a thirty-minute delay—and on this the licensed drivers did much worse than the group who had never been trained to become taxi drivers. By contrast, the trainees who had dropped out scored about the same as the subjects who had never trained. Because all three groups scored equally well on this memory test at the start of the four-year period, the only explanation was that the licensed cabbies, by developing their memories of London streets, had done something to cause a decline in this other sort of memory. Although we don’t know for sure what caused that, it seems likely that the intense training caused the trainees’ brains to devote an increasingly large segment to this sort of memory, leaving less gray matter to devote to other sorts of memory.*  

- Page 60 (location ~ 919-930)    

*“Good enough” is generally good enough. But it’s important to remember that the option exists. If you wish to become significantly better at something, you can. And here is the key difference between the traditional approach to learning and the purposeful-practice or deliberate-practice approaches: The traditional approach is not designed to challenge homeostasis. It assumes, consciously or not, that learning is all about fulfilling your innate potential and that you can develop a particular skill or ability without getting too far out of your comfort zone. In this view, all that you are doing with practice—indeed, all that you can do—is to reach a fixed potential.*

*He first became interested in blindfold chess around the same time as he began playing in correspondence tournaments. The event that triggered Alekhine’s interest in blindfold chess was a 1902 exhibition in Moscow by the U.S. chess champion Harry Nelson Pillsbury, who set a world record at that exhibition by playing twenty-two games simultaneously. As Alekhine would later tell it, his brother Alexei was one of Pillsbury’s opponents that day, although the records of the match that we have today hold no indication that Alexei actually played. Either way, though, the demonstration made a serious impression on the young Alekhine, and a couple of years later he began to try blindfold chess himself. It was, he later wrote, a natural outgrowth of his habit of thinking about chess positions while he was in the classroom. At first he would sketch out positions and use the sketches to work out the best moves, but eventually he found that he could study the positions just as well without the diagrams—that he could hold the entire chessboard in his memory and move pieces around in his mind, trying various lines of play.*  

- Page 65 (location ~ 997-1005)    

*At the end of 1923 he was in Montreal and decided to try to break the North American record for simultaneous blindfold chess games. The North American record at the time was twenty games, held by Pillsbury, so Alekhine played twenty-one. It went well, so he decided to go for the world record, which at the time was twenty-five games. That led to the demonstration at the Hotel Alamac. Over the coming years Alekhine would set the world record twice more—with twenty-eight games in 1925 and thirty-two games in 1933—but he always contended that blindfold chess was little more than a way of bringing attention to the game of chess and, of course, to himself. It was never something that he made a special effort to develop, but rather something that grew out of his relentless effort to master the game and become the best in the world. Alekhine eventually reached his goal, defeating José Raúl Capablanca in 1927 for the world championship. He held that title until 1935 and then again from 1937 to 1946, and many rankings place Alekhine among the ten best chess players of all time. But when people rank the greatest blindfold chess players of all time, Alekhine’s name is generally at the very top of the list—even though blindfold chess was never his main focus. If we look at the overall history of blindfold chess, we find that this same thing is true for most blindfold chess players throughout history. They worked to become chess masters, and they found themselves, with little or no additional effort, able to play blindfolded.*

*Herb and Bill asked a simple question: Are chess experts recalling the position of each piece, or are they actually remembering patterns, where the individual pieces are seen as part of a larger whole? To answer that question Herb and Bill carried out a simple but effective experiment. They tested a national-level chess player (i.e., a chess master), a mid-range chess player, and a chess novice on two types of boards, one that had the pieces arranged in a pattern taken from a real chess game, and the other with a random jumble of pieces of the sort that made no chess sense at all. When shown chessboards with a dozen to two dozen pieces arranged in a pattern from the middle or the end of a chess game, the master could remember the positions of about two-thirds of the pieces after five seconds of study, the novice could remember only about four, and the mid-range player was somewhere in the middle. When shown chessboards with the pieces arrayed randomly, the novice player did somewhat worse—only about two pieces correct. No surprise there. What was surprising, however, was that neither the mid-range player nor the chess master did much better than the novice in remembering the positions of pieces arranged randomly on a board. They too got only about two or three pieces right. The experienced players’ advantage had disappeared. More recent studies of large groups of chess players have reiterated the original findings. Something very similar has been shown with verbal memory. If you ask someone to recall a seemingly random assortment of words verbatim, starting with the first word—“was smelled front that his the peanuts he good hunger eating barely woman of so in could that him contain”—the average person will remember only the first six of those words. If, however, you read the same words rearranged into a sentence that makes clear sense—“The woman in front of him was eating peanuts that smelled so good that he could barely contain his hunger”—some adults will remember all of the words in perfect order, and most people will remember most of the sentence. What’s the difference? The second arrangement carries meaning that allows us to make sense of the words using preexisting “mental representations.” They’re not random; they mean something, and meaning aids memory.*  

- Page 69 (location ~ 1046-1062)    

*Anyone who is serious about developing skills on the chessboard will do it mainly by spending countless hours studying games played by the masters. You analyze a position in depth, predicting the next move, and if you get it wrong, you go back and figure out what you missed. Research has shown that the amount of time spent in this sort of analysis—not the amount of time spent playing chess with others—is the single most important predictor of a chess player’s ability. It generally takes about ten years of this sort of practice to reach the level of grandmaster. These years of practice make it possible for chess players to recognize patterns of chess pieces—not just their positions, but the interactions among them—at a glance. They are old friends. Bill Chase and Herb Simon called these patterns “chunks,” and the important thing about them is that they are held in long-term memory. Simon estimated that by the time a chess player becomes a master, he or she has accumulated some fifty thousand of these chunks. A master who examines a chess position sees a collection of chunks that are interacting with other chunks in still other patterns. Research has shown that these chunks are organized hierarchically, with groups of chunks arranged into higher-level patterns. The hierarchy is analogous to the organizational structure of a business or other large institution, with individuals organized into teams, which are organized into units, which are organized into departments, and so on, with the higher-level pieces being more abstracted and further from the bottom level where the real action takes place (which, in the case of the chess example, is the level of the individual chess pieces). The way that grandmasters process and make sense of chess positions is an example of a mental representation. It is their way of “seeing” the board, and it’s quite different from how a novice would see the same board.*

*Much of deliberate practice involves developing ever more efficient mental representations that you can use in whatever activity you are practicing. When Steve Faloon was training to improve his ability to remember long strings of digits, he developed increasingly sophisticated ways to encode those digits mentally—that is, he created mental representations. When London taxi trainees are learning to navigate efficiently from every point A to every point B in the city, they do it by developing increasingly sophisticated mental maps of the city—that is, by making mental representations. Even when the skill being practiced is primarily physical, a major factor is the development of the proper mental representations. Consider a competitive diver working on a new dive. Much of the practice is devoted to forming a clear mental picture of what the dive should look like at every moment and, more importantly, what it should feel like in terms of body positioning and momentum.*  

- Page 73 (location ~ 1111-1118)    

*A key fact about such mental representations is that they are very “domain specific,” that is, they apply only to the skill for which they were developed. We saw this with Steve Faloon: the mental representations he had devised to remember strings of digits did nothing to improve his memory for strings of letters. Similarly, a chess player’s mental representations will give him or her no advantage over others in tests involving general visuospatial abilities, and a diver’s mental representations will be useless for basketball. This explains a crucial fact about expert performance in general: there is no such thing as developing a general skill. You don’t train your memory; you train your memory for strings of digits or for collections of words or for people’s faces. You don’t train to become an athlete; you train to become a gymnast or a sprinter or a marathoner or a swimmer or a basketball player. You don’t train to become a doctor; you train to become a diagnostician or a pathologist or a neurosurgeon. Of course, some people do become overall memory experts or athletes in a number of sports or doctors*

*Consider how professional baseball players are able to consistently hit balls that are pitched toward them at speeds that may exceed ninety miles per hour—something that’s impossible for anyone who hasn’t spent years training in that particular skill. These hitters have just a split second to decide whether to swing and, if so, where to swing. They have no better eyesight than an average person, and their reflexes are no faster. What they have is a set of mental representations developed through years of hitting pitches and getting immediate feedback about their expectations concerning a pitch. These representations enable them to quickly recognize what sort of pitch is coming and where it will likely be when it reaches them. As soon as they see the pitcher’s arm come around and the ball leave his hand, they have a very good idea—without having to do any sort of conscious calculations—whether it will be a fastball, slider, or curve and approximately where it’s heading. In essence, they’ve learned to read the pitcher’s delivery, so they have less need to actually see how the ball travels before determining whether and where to swing the bat. The rest of us, who are illiterate where pitching is concerned, simply can’t make these decisions before the ball arrives in the catcher’s mitt.*  

- Page 76 (location ~ 1152-1161)    

*The best way to understand exactly what these mental representations are and how they work is, fittingly enough, to develop a good mental representation of the concept mental representation. And just as was the case with dog, the best way to develop a mental representation of mental representations is to spend a little time getting to know them, stroking their fur, patting their little heads, and watching as they perform their tricks.*

*Take soccer, for instance. You have eleven players on a side moving around in a way that to the uninitiated seems a swirling chaos with no discernible pattern beyond the obvious fact that some players are drawn to the soccer ball whenever it comes near. To those who know and love the game, however, and particularly to those who play the game well, this chaos is no chaos at all. It is all a beautifully nuanced and constantly shifting pattern created as the players move in response to the ball and the movements of the other players. The best players recognize and respond to the patterns almost instantaneously, taking advantage of weaknesses or openings as soon as they appear. To study this phenomenon, I and two colleagues, Paul Ward and Mark Williams, investigated how well soccer players can predict what’s coming next from what has already happened on the field. To do this we showed them videos of real soccer matches and suddenly stopped the video when a player had just received the ball. Then we asked our subjects to predict what would happen next. Would the player with the ball keep it, attempt a shot at the goal, or pass the ball to a teammate? We found that the more accomplished players were much better at deciding what the player with the ball should do. We also tested the players’ memory for where the relevant players were located and in what directions they were moving by asking them to recall as much as they could from the last frame of the video before it was hidden from them. Again, the better players outperformed the weaker ones.*

*Another important fact about mental representations was shown in a 2014 study by German researchers who looked at indoor rock climbing. In this sport, which is designed to mimic and serve as training for outdoor rock climbing, one must climb a vertical wall using various handholds. These holds require different kinds of grips, including an open grip, a pocket grip, a sideways pull, and a crimp grip. For each grip, the climber must position his or her hands and fingers differently. If you use the wrong grip on a handhold, you’re more likely to fall. Using standard psychological techniques, the researchers examined what was going on in the brains of climbers when they surveyed the various holds. They first noted that, unlike novices, experienced climbers automatically identified each hold according to the type of grip it required. In their mental representations of the various holds, all of the holds that required a crimp grip, for instance, were put together in one group and were distinguished from the holds that required, say, a pocket grip, which were themselves mentally put into a separate group. This grouping was done unconsciously, just as you can look at a poodle and Great Dane and know instantly they are both members of the same category without ever actually saying to yourself, “Those are both dogs.”*

*For instance, most everyone reading this right now is an “expert” in reading, and to get to that level you had to develop certain mental representations. It began with learning the correspondence between letters and sounds. At that point reading was a matter of laboriously sounding out each word, letter by letter. With practice, you began to recognize entire words by themselves. C-A-T became simply cat, thanks to a mental representation that encoded the pattern of the letters in that word and associated that pattern with both the sound of the word and the idea of a small, furry animal that meows and often doesn’t get along well with dogs. Along with the mental representations for the words, you developed a variety of other representations that are essential in reading. You learned how to recognize the beginning and ending of a sentence so that you could break up the strings of words into chunks that had individual meaning, and you learned that certain things that looked like they signaled the end of a sentence—Mr., Ms., Dr., and so on—usually did not. You internalized various patterns that allow you to infer the meanings of words you have never seen before and to use context to make sense of things where a word is misspelled or misused or left out altogether. And now when you read, you do all of this unconsciously, the mental representations churning away under the surface, unnoticed but essential.*

*To see why, consider what happens when you test a group of subjects by having them read a newspaper article on something a bit specialized—say, a football or baseball game—and then quiz them to see how much of it they remember. You might guess that the results would depend mainly on the subjects’ general verbal ability (which is closely related to IQ), but you’d be wrong. Studies have shown that the key factor determining a person’s comprehension of a story about a football or baseball game is how much that person already understands about the sport. The reason is straightforward: If you don’t know much about the sport, then all of the details you read are essentially a bunch of unrelated facts, and remembering them is not much easier than remembering a list of random words. But if you understand the sport, you’ve already established a mental structure for making sense of it, organized the information, and combined it with all the other relevant information you’ve already assimilated. The new information becomes part of an ongoing story, and as such it moves quickly and easily into your long-term memory, allowing you to remember far more of the information in an article than you could if you were unfamiliar with the game it describes.*

*The solution to the medical mystery described in the New York Times required precisely that sort of approach: first come up with possible explanations for why a patient should have both Horner’s syndrome and a knifelike pain in the ear, and then analyze each possibility to find the right answer. Stroke was one possibility, but the patient had nothing in his background that indicated he might have had a stroke. Shingles could also produce the patient’s two symptoms, but he had none of the usual signs of shingles such as blisters or a rash. A third possibility was a tear in the wall of the carotid artery, which runs right alongside the nerve affected in Horner’s and also passes near the ear. A slight tear in the artery can allow blood to leak through the inner walls of the artery, causing a bulge in its outer wall, which can press on the nerve to the face and, in rare cases, also press on a nerve to the ear. With this in mind, the specialist asked the patient questions about lifting weights and headaches. It is known that weightlifting can sometimes tear the carotid artery, and such a tear would normally be associated with some sort of headache or neck pain. When the patient answered yes, the specialist decided that a tear in the carotid artery was the most likely diagnosis. An MRI scan verified that diagnosis, and the patient was put on blood thinners to prevent the formation of a blood clot and was told to avoid any sort of exertion for the several months that it would take the blood vessel to heal.*

The key to the successful diagnosis wasn’t merely having the necessary medical knowledge, but having that knowledge organized and accessible in a way that allowed the doctor to come up with possible diagnoses and to zero in on the most likely. The superior organization of information is a theme that appears over and over again in the study of expert performers. This is true even for something as mundane as insurance sales. A recent study examined knowledge about multiline insurance (life, home, auto, and commercial) in 150 agents.*

*There has been quite a bit of research into the representations people use when writing, and the research has demonstrated a profound difference between the methods used by expert writers and those used by novices. Consider, for example, the answer that a sixth-grader offered when asked about the strategy he used in writing an essay: I have a whole bunch of ideas and write down till my supply of ideas is exhausted. Then I might try to think of more ideas up to the point where you can’t get any more ideas that are worth putting down on paper and then I would end it. This approach is actually pretty typical, not just for sixth-graders but for many people who don’t write for a living. The representation of the writing is simple and direct: there’s a topic and there are various thoughts that the writer has on the topic, often loosely organized by relevance or importance, but sometimes by category or some other pattern. A slightly more sophisticated representation might include some sort of introduction at the beginning and a conclusion or summary at the end, but that’s about it. This approach to writing has been called “knowledge telling” because it is little more than telling the reader whatever comes into your head. Expert writers do it very differently. Consider how my coauthor and I put this book together. First we had to figure out what we wanted the book to do. What did we want readers to learn about expertise? What concepts and ideas were important to introduce? How should a reader’s ideas about training and potential be changed by reading this book? Answering questions like these gave us our first rough mental representation of the book—our goals for it, what we wanted it to accomplish. Of course, as we worked more and more on the book, that initial image evolved, but it was a start. Next we started sketching out how we would accomplish our goals for the book. What general topics did we need to cover? Obviously we needed to explain what deliberate practice is. How would we do that? Well, first we would need to explain how people normally practice and the limitations of that approach, and then we would discuss purposeful practice, and so on. At that point we were envisioning various approaches we could use to reach our goals for the book and weighing them, seeing which options seemed best.*  

- Page 87 (location ~ 1321-1339)    

*We found that this process also forced us to think carefully about how we conceptualized deliberate practice ourselves. We started off with what seemed to be a clear idea of deliberate practice and how to explain it, but as we tried to describe it briefly in a nontechnical way, sometimes we found that it just wasn’t working as well as we would have liked. That would lead us to rethink the best way to explain a concept or to make a point. For example, when we presented our initial proposal to our agent, Elyse Cheney, she and her colleagues had trouble understanding deliberate practice clearly. In particular, they didn’t get what separates deliberate practice from other forms of practice, other than that it is more effective. This was not their fault, but an indication that we hadn’t made our explanation as readily intelligible as we’d thought. That forced us to rethink how we were presenting deliberate practice—in essence, to come up with a new and better mental representation of how we thought about it and how we wanted others to think about it. It soon occurred to us that the role of mental representations held the key to how we wanted to present deliberate practice. Initially, we had seen mental representations as being just one aspect of deliberate practice among many that we would present to the reader, but now we began to see them as a central feature—perhaps the central feature—of the book. The main purpose of deliberate practice is to develop effective mental representations, and, as we will discuss shortly, mental representations in turn play a key role in deliberate practice. The key change that occurs in our adaptable brains in response to deliberate practice is the development of better mental representations, which in turn open up new possibilities for improved performance. In short, we came to see our explanation of mental representations as the keystone of the book, without which the rest of the book could not stand.*

*In particular, the researchers counted the number of mistakes a student made in practicing a piece the first time and the second time and used the improvement from the first time to the second as a measurement of how effectively the student was practicing. They found a wide variation in the amount of improvement. Of all the students they studied, a female cornet player in her first year of learning the instrument made the most mistakes: 11 per minute, on average, on the first times playing pieces during practice sessions. On the second time through, she was still making the same mistakes 70 percent of the time—noticing and correcting only 3 out of every 10 mistakes. By contrast, the best first-year player, a boy who was learning the saxophone, made only 1.4 mistakes per minute on his first times through. And on the second times through, he was making the same mistakes only 20 percent of the time—correcting 8 out of every 10 mistakes. The difference in the percentage of corrections is particularly striking because the saxophone player was already making many fewer mistakes, so he had much less room for improvement. All of the students had good attitudes and were motivated to improve, so McPherson and Renwick concluded that the differences among the students most likely lay, in large part, in how well the students were able to detect their mistakes—that is, how effective their mental representations of the musical pieces were. The saxophone player had a clear mental representation of the piece that allowed him to recognize most of his mistakes, remember them the next time, and correct them. The cornet player, on the other hand, didn’t seem to have such a well-developed mental representation of what she was playing. The difference between the two was not in desire or effort, the researchers said. The cornet player just didn’t have the same tools with which to improve as the saxophone player did.*

*In any area, not just musical performance, the relationship between skill and mental representations is a virtuous circle: the more skilled you become, the better your mental representations are, and the better your mental representations are, the more effectively you can practice to hone your skill. We can see a more detailed depiction of how an expert uses mental representations through a long-term collaboration between Roger Chaffin, a psychologist at the University of Connecticut, and Gabriela Imreh, an internationally known pianist based in New Jersey. For years they have been working together to understand what goes through Imreh’s head as she studies, practices, and performs a piece of music. Much of Chaffin’s work with Imreh is reminiscent of how I monitored Steve Faloon’s development of mental representations for memorizing strings of digits. He observes her as she is learning a new piece of music and has her voice her thought processes as she determines how she will play it. He also videotapes these practice sessions so that he has additional clues as to how Imreh is approaching her task.*

*Some activities, such as playing music in pop music groups, solving crossword puzzles, and folk dancing, have no standard training approaches. Whatever methods there are seem slapdash and produce unpredictable results. Other activities, like classical music performance, mathematics, and ballet, are blessed with highly developed, broadly accepted training methods. If one follows these methods carefully and diligently, one will almost surely become an expert. I’ve spent my career studying this second sort of field. These fields have several characteristics in common. First, there are always objective ways—such as the win/loss of a chess competition or a head-to-head race—or at least semiobjective ways—such as evaluation by expert judges—to measure performance. This makes sense: if there is no agreement on what good performance is and no way to tell what changes would improve performance, then it is very difficult—often impossible—to develop effective training methods. If you don’t know for sure what constitutes improvement, how can you develop methods to improve performance? Second, these fields tend to be competitive enough that performers have strong incentive to practice and improve. Third, these fields are generally well established, with the relevant skills having been developed over decades or even centuries. And fourth, these fields have a subset of performers who also serve as teachers and coaches and who, over time, have developed increasingly sophisticated sets of training techniques that make possible the field’s steadily increasing skill level. The improvement of skills and the development of training techniques move forward hand in hand, with new training techniques leading to new levels of accomplishment and new accomplishments generating innovations in training. (The virtuous circle again.) This joint development of skills and training techniques has—up to now at least—always been carried out through trial and error, with a field’s practitioners experimenting with various ways to improve, keeping what works and discarding what doesn’t.*

*The thirty music students were also asked to keep daily diaries for each of the next seven days in which they would detail exactly how they’d spent their time. In the diaries, they recorded their activities in fifteen-minute increments: sleeping, eating, going to class, studying, practicing alone, practicing with others, performing, and so on. When they were done we had a detailed picture of how they’d spent their days as well as a very good idea of their practice histories. The students from all three groups gave similar answers to most of our questions. The students pretty much all agreed, for instance, that solitary practice was the most important factor in improving their performance, followed by such things as practicing with others, taking lessons, performing (particularly in solo performance), listening to music, and studying music theory. Many of them also said that getting enough sleep was very important to their improvement. Because their practice was so intense, they needed to recharge their batteries with a full night’s sleep—and often an afternoon nap. One of our most significant findings was that most factors the students had identified as being important to improvement were also seen as labor-intensive and not much fun; the only exceptions were listening to music and sleeping. Everyone from the very top students to the future music teachers agreed: improvement was hard, and they didn’t enjoy the work they did to improve. In short, there were no students who just loved to practice and thus needed less motivation than the others. These students were motivated to practice intensely and with full concentration because they saw such practice as essential to improving their performance. The other crucial finding was that there was only one major difference among the three groups. This was the total number of hours that the students had devoted to solitary practice.*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1596-1610)    

*We found that the best violin students had, on average, spent significantly more time than the better violin students had spent, and that the top two groups—better and best—had spent much more time on solitary practice than the music-education students. Specifically, the music-education students had practiced an average of 3,420 hours on the violin by the time they were eighteen, the better violin students had practiced an average of 5,301 hours, and the best violin students had practiced an average of 7,410 hours. Nobody had been slacking—even the least accomplished of the students had put in thousands of hours of practice, far more than anyone would have who played the violin just for fun—but these were clearly major differences in practice time. Looking more closely, we found that the largest differences in practice time among the three groups of students had come in the preteen and teenage years. This is a particularly challenging time for young people to keep up their music practice because of the many interests that compete for their time—studying, shopping, hanging out with friends, partying, and so on. Our results indicated that those preteens and teens who could maintain and even increase their heavy practice schedule during these years ended up in the top group of violinists at the academy.*

*That study of the Berlin violin students introduced me to this sort of practice, which I named “deliberate practice,” and I have since studied it in many other fields. When my colleagues and I published our results on the violin students, we described deliberate practice as follows. We began by noting that the levels of performance in such areas as musical performance and sports activities have increased greatly over time, and that as individuals have developed greater and more complex skills and performance, teachers and coaches have developed various methods to teach these skills. The improvement in performance generally has gone hand in hand with the development of teaching methods, and today anyone who wishes to become an expert in these fields will need an instructor’s help. Because few students can afford a full-time teacher, the standard pattern is to have a lesson once or a few times in a week, with the teachers assigning practice activities the student is expected to perform between lessons. These activities are generally designed with the student’s current abilities in mind and are intended to push him or her to move just beyond the current skill level. It was these practice activities that my colleagues and I defined as “deliberate practice.”*

*In particular, deliberate practice is informed and guided by the best performers’ accomplishments and by an understanding of what these expert performers do to excel. Deliberate practice is purposeful practice that knows where it is going and how to get there. In short, deliberate practice is characterized by the following traits: Deliberate practice develops skills that other people have already figured out how to do and for which effective training techniques have been established. The practice regimen should be designed and overseen by a teacher or coach who is familiar with the abilities of expert performers and with how those abilities can best be developed. Deliberate practice takes place outside one’s comfort zone and requires a student to constantly try things that are just beyond his or her current abilities. Thus it demands near-maximal effort, which is generally not enjoyable. Deliberate practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving some aspect of the target performance; it is not aimed at some vague overall improvement. Once an overall goal has been set, a teacher or coach will develop a plan for making a series of small changes that will add up to the desired larger change. Improving some aspect of the target performance allows a performer to see that his or her performances have been improved by the training. Deliberate practice is deliberate, that is, it requires a person’s full attention and conscious actions. It isn’t enough to simply follow a teacher’s or coach’s directions. The student must concentrate on the specific goal for his or her practice activity so that adjustments can be made to control practice. Deliberate practice involves feedback and modification of efforts in response to that feedback. Early in the training process much of the feedback will come from the teacher or coach, who will monitor progress, point out problems, and offer ways to address those problems. With time and experience students must learn to monitor themselves, spot mistakes, and adjust accordingly. Such self-monitoring requires effective mental representations. Deliberate practice both produces and depends on effective mental representations. Improving performance goes hand in hand with improving mental representations; as one’s performance improves, the representations become more detailed and effective, in turn making it possible to improve even more. Mental representations make it possible to monitor how one is doing, both in practice and in actual performance. They show the right way*

*While they may lack teachers to design their practice sessions, they can draw on the advice previous experts have recorded in books or interviews. And memory experts will often help others who want to acquire similar skills. Thus, while digit-memory training isn’t deliberate practice in its strictest sense, it captures the most important element—learning from the best predecessors—and that has proved enough to generate rapid improvements in the field. This is the basic blueprint for getting better in any pursuit: get as close to deliberate practice as you can. If you’re in a field where deliberate practice is an option, you should take that option. If not, apply the principles of deliberate practice as much as possible. In practice this often boils down to purposeful practice with a few extra steps: first, identify the expert performers, then figure out what they do that*

*Research has shown that the “experts” in many fields don’t perform reliably better than other, less highly regarded members of the profession—or sometimes even than people who have had no training at all. In his influential book House of Cards: Psychology and Psychotherapy Built on Myth, the psychologist Robyn Dawes described research showing that licensed psychiatrists and psychologists were no more effective at performing therapy than laypeople who had received minimal training. Similarly, many studies have found that the performance of financial “experts” in picking stocks is little or no better than the performance of novices or random chance. And, as we noted earlier, doctors in general practice with several decades of experience sometimes perform worse, when judged by objective measures, than doctors with just a few years of experience—mainly because the younger doctors attended medical school more recently, so their training is more up-to-date and they are more likely to remember it. Contrary to expectations, experience doesn’t lead to improved performance among many types of doctors and nurses. The lesson here is clear: be careful when identifying expert performers. Ideally you want some objective measure of performance with which to compare people’s abilities. If no such measures exist, get as close as you can. For example, in areas where a person’s performance or product can be observed directly—a screenwriter, say, or a programmer—the judgment of peers is a good place to start, while keeping in mind the possible influence of unconscious bias.*  

- Page 117 (location ~ 1787-1799)    

*In a field you’re already familiar with—like your own job—think carefully about what characterizes good performance and try to come up with ways to measure that, even if there must be a certain amount of subjectivity in your measurement. Then look for those people who score highest in the areas you believe are key to superior performance. Remember that the ideal is to find objective, reproducible measures that consistently distinguish the best from the rest, and if that ideal is not possible, approximate it as well as you can. Once you’ve identified the expert performers in a field, the next step is to figure out specifically what they do that separates them from other, less accomplished people in the same field, and what training methods helped them get there. This is not always easy. Why does one teacher improve students’ performances more than another? Why does one surgeon have better outcomes than another? Why does one salesperson consistently make more sales than another? You can generally bring an expert in the field in to observe the performance of various individuals and make suggestions about what they are doing well and what they need to improve on, but it may not be obvious, even to experts, exactly what differentiates the best performers from everyone else.*  

- Page 118 (location ~ 1804-1813)    

*Lesson: Once you have identified an expert, identify what this person does differently from others that could explain the superior performance. There are likely to be many things the person does differently that have nothing to do with the superior performance, but at least it is a place to start. In all of this keep in mind that the idea is to inform your purposeful practice and point it in directions that will be more effective. If you find that something works, keep doing it; if it doesn’t work, stop. The better you are able to tailor your training to mirror the best performers in your field, the more effective your training is likely to be. And finally remember that, whenever possible, the best approach is almost always to work with a good coach or teacher. An effective instructor will understand what must go into a successful training regimen and will be able to modify it as necessary to suit individual students.*  

- Page 120 (location ~ 1832-1839)    

*Finally, a good teacher can give you valuable feedback you couldn’t get any other way. Effective feedback is about more than whether you did something right or wrong. A good math teacher, for instance, will look at more than the answer to a problem; he’ll look at exactly how the student got the answer as a way of understanding the mental representations the student was using. If needed, he’ll offer advice on how to think more effectively about the problem.*

*with the publication of Malcolm Gladwell’s Outliers, that our results attracted much attention from outside the scientific community. In his discussion of what it takes to become a top performer in a given field, Gladwell offered a catchy phrase: “the ten-thousand-hour rule.” According to this rule, it takes ten thousand hours of practice to become a master in most fields. We had indeed mentioned this figure in our report as the average number of hours that the best violinists had spent on solitary practice by the time they were twenty. Gladwell himself estimated that the Beatles had put in about ten thousand hours of practice while playing in Hamburg in the early 1960s and that Bill Gates put in roughly ten thousand hours of programming to develop his skills to a degree that allowed him to found and develop Microsoft. In general, Gladwell suggested, the same thing is true in essentially every field of human endeavor—people don’t become expert at something until they’ve put in about ten thousand hours of practice. The rule is irresistibly appealing. It’s easy to remember, for one thing. It would’ve been far less effective if those violinists had put in, say, eleven thousand hours of practice by the time they were twenty. And it satisfies the human desire to discover a simple cause-and-effect relationship: just put in ten thousand hours of practice at anything, and you will become a master. Unfortunately, this rule—which is the only thing that many people today know about the effects of practice—is wrong in several ways. (It is also correct in one important way, which I will get to shortly.) First, there is nothing special or magical about ten thousand hours. Gladwell could just as easily have mentioned the average amount of time the best violin students had practiced by the time they were eighteen—approximately seventy-four hundred hours—but he chose to refer to the total practice time they had accumulated by the time they were twenty, because it was a nice round number. And, either way, at eighteen or twenty, these students were nowhere near masters of the violin. They were very good, promising students who were likely headed to the top of their field, but they still had a long way to go when I studied them.*  

- Page 121 (location ~ 1852-1868)    

*The final problem with the ten-thousand-hour rule is that, although Gladwell himself didn’t say this, many people have interpreted it as a promise that almost anyone can become an expert in a given field by putting in ten thousand hours of practice. But nothing in my study implied this. To show a result like this, I would have needed to put a collection of randomly chosen people through ten thousand hours of deliberate practice on the violin and then see how they turned out. All that our study had shown was that among the students who had become good enough to be admitted to the Berlin music academy, the best students had put in, on average, significantly more hours of solitary practice than the better students, and the better and best students had put in more solitary practice than the music-education students. The question of whether anyone can become an expert performer in a given field by taking part in enough designed practice is still open, and I will offer some thoughts on this issue*

*The final problem with the ten-thousand-hour rule is that, although Gladwell himself didn’t say this, many people have interpreted it as a promise that almost anyone can become an expert in a given field by putting in ten thousand hours of practice. But nothing in my study implied this. To show a result like this, I would have needed to put a collection of randomly chosen people through ten thousand hours of deliberate practice on the violin and then see how they turned out. All that our study had shown was that among the students who had become good enough to be admitted to the Berlin music academy, the best students had put in, on average, significantly more hours of solitary practice than the better students, and the better and best students had put in more solitary practice than the music-education students. The question of whether anyone can become an expert performer in a given field by taking part in enough designed practice is still open, and I will offer some thoughts on this issue in the next chapter. But there was nothing in the original study to suggest that it was so.*

*Gladwell’s ten-thousand-hour rule captures this fundamental truth—that in many areas of human endeavor it takes many, many years of practice to become one of the best in the world—in a forceful, memorable way, and that’s a good thing. On the other hand, emphasizing what it takes to become one of the best in the world in such competitive fields as music, chess, or academic research leads us to overlook what I believe to be the more important lesson from our study of the violin students. When we say that it takes ten thousand—or however many—hours to become really good at something, we put the focus on the daunting nature of the task. While some may take this as a challenge—as if to say, “All I have to do is spend ten thousand hours working on this, and I’ll be one of the best in the world!”—many will see it as a stop sign: “Why should I even try if it’s going to take me ten thousand hours to get really good?” As Dogbert observed in one Dilbert comic strip, “I would think a willingness to practice the same thing for ten thousand hours is a mental disorder.” But I see the core message as something else altogether: In pretty much any area of human endeavor, people have a tremendous capacity to improve their performance, as long as they train in the right way. If you practice something for a few hundred hours, you will almost certainly see great improvement—think of what two hundred hours of practice brought Steve Faloon—but you have only scratched the surface. You can keep going and going and going, getting better and better and better. How much you improve is up to you. This puts the ten-thousand-hour rule in a completely different light: The reason that you must put in ten thousand or more hours of practice to become one of the world’s best violinists or chess players or golfers is that the people you are being compared to or competing with have themselves put in ten thousand or more hours of practice.*

*when the class was over, the Blue Force pilots—now much more experienced in dogfighting than almost any pilot who hadn’t been to Top Gun—returned to their units, where they would become squadron training officers and pass on what they had learned to the other pilots in their squadrons. The results of this training were dramatic. U.S. forces had stopped their bombing throughout all of 1969, so there were no dogfights that year, but the air war resumed in 1970, including air-to-air combat between fighters. Over the next three years, from 1970 to 1973, U.S. Navy pilots shot down an average of 12.5 North Vietnamese fighter planes for every U.S. Navy plane that was lost. During the same time, air force pilots had approximately the same two-to-one ratio they had had before the bombing halt. Perhaps the clearest way to see the results of the Top Gun training is to look at the “kills per engagement” statistics. Throughout the entire war, U.S. fighters downed an enemy jet an average of once every five encounters. However, in 1972, which was the last full year of fighting, Navy fighter pilots shot down an average of 1.04 jets per encounter. In other words, on average, every time navy pilots came in contact with the enemy they would down an enemy plane.*

*The first is our old friend, the belief that one’s abilities are limited by one’s genetically prescribed characteristics. That belief manifests itself in all sorts of “I can’t” or “I’m not” statements: “I’m just not very creative.” “I can’t manage people.” “I’m not any good with numbers.” “I can’t do much better than this.” But, as we’ve seen, the right sort of practice can help pretty much anyone improve in just about any area they choose to focus on. We can shape our own potential. Art has a clever technique for making this point with his clients. When he is speaking with corporate leaders and he hears someone express one of these “I can’t” or “I’m not” attitudes, he throws a red challenge flag like an NFL coach protesting a referee’s call. It is meant to send the signal that the person who expressed the negative thoughts needs to reevaluate and revise them. The sudden appearance of a red flag in a conference room lightens the atmosphere, but it also makes his point in a way that people remember: mindset matters.*  

- Page 132 (location ~ 2021-2029)    

*The third myth states that all it takes to improve is effort. If you just try hard enough, you’ll get better. If you want to be a better manager, try harder. If you want to generate more sales, try harder. If you want to improve your teamwork, try harder. The reality is, however, that all of these things—managing, selling, teamwork—are specialized skills, and unless you are using practice techniques specifically designed to improve those particular skills, trying hard will not get you very far. The deliberate-practice mindset offers a very different view: anyone can improve, but it requires the right approach. If you are not improving, it’s not because you lack innate talent; it’s because you’re not practicing the right way. Once you understand this, improvement becomes a matter of figuring out what the “right way” is. And this, of course, is what Art Turock—like his many peers in the training and development world—has set out to do, but in Art’s case much of the advice he offers has its roots in the principles of deliberate practice. One particular such approach is what Art calls “learning while real work gets done.” The approach acknowledges that businesspeople are so busy that they have hardly any time to practice their skills. They are in a totally different situation than, say, a concert pianist or pro athlete who spends relatively little time performing and thus can devote hours to practice each day. So Art set out to come up with ways that normal business activities could be turned into opportunities for purposeful or deliberate practice.*  

- Page 133 (location ~ 2032-2043)    

*For anyone in the business or professional world looking for an effective approach to improvement, my basic advice is to look for one that follows the principles of deliberate practice: Does it push people to get outside their comfort zones and attempt to do things that are not easy for them? Does it offer immediate feedback on the performance and on what can be done to improve it? Have those who developed the approach identified the best performers in that particular area and determined what sets them apart from everyone else? Is the practice designed to develop the particular skills that experts in the field possess? A yes answer to all those questions may not guarantee that an approach will be effective, but it will certainly make that much more likely.*  

- Page 135 (location ~ 2067-2072)    

*In short, this sort of training with immediate feedback—either from a mentor or even a carefully designed computer program—can be an incredibly powerful way to improve performance. Furthermore, I believe that radiology training could be even more effective if an effort were made up front to determine what sorts of issues are likely to cause problems for new radiologists and design the training to focus more on those issues—in essence, to learn more about the role that mental representations play in making accurate diagnoses and apply that understanding in designing the training. Some researchers have used the same sort of think-aloud protocol I used in studying Steve Faloon in order to understand the mental processes underlying superior performance among radiologists, and it seems clear from this work that the best radiologists have indeed developed more accurate mental representations. We even have a good idea of the types of cases and lesions that give trouble to the less expert radiologists. Unfortunately, we do not yet know enough about the differences between how expert and nonexpert radiologists make their judgments to design training programs to address the weaknesses of the less accomplished ones.*  

- Page 139 (location ~ 2128-2137)    

*More generally, this Top Gun approach could be applied in a wide variety of areas in which people could benefit from practicing something over and over again “offline”—that is, away from their real job, where mistakes have real consequences. This is the rationale behind using simulators to train pilots, surgeons, and many others in high-stakes professions. Indeed, using libraries of mammograms to train radiologists is a kind of simulation. But there are many more areas where this concept could be put to use. One could imagine, for instance, creating a library of case studies designed to help tax accountants hone their skills in certain specialties, or to help intelligence analysts improve their abilities to interpret what is happening in a foreign country. Even in those areas where simulators or other techniques are already being used to improve performance, their effectiveness could be greatly increased by explicitly taking into account the lessons of deliberate practice. As I mentioned, while simulators are used in a number of areas of surgery, they could probably improve performance much more effectively if their design took into account what is known—or what can be learned—about the mental representations of the most effective surgeons in a given specialty. It is also possible to improve simulator training by determining which errors are most common and most dangerous and by setting up the simulators to focus on the situations where those errors happen. For example, during surgery it is not uncommon that some interruption brings the procedure to a temporary halt, and if the interruption occurs while someone is starting to check the blood type prior to a blood transfusion, it is critical that the person continue this checking when the activity resumes after the interruption.*

*As I noted, most people assume that as you continue to play tennis and accumulate all of those hours of “practice,” you will inevitably get better, but the reality is different: as we’ve seen, people generally don’t get much better just by playing the game itself, and, sometimes, they’ll actually be worse. This similarity between doctors and recreational tennis players was shown in 2005 when a group of researchers at Harvard Medical School published an extensive review of research looking at how the quality of care that doctors provide changes over time. If years of practice make physicians better, then the quality of care they give should increase as they amass more experience. But just the opposite was true. In almost every one of the five dozen studies included in the review, doctors’ performance grew worse over time or, at best, stayed about the same. The older doctors knew less and did worse in terms of providing appropriate care than doctors with far fewer years of experience, and researchers concluded that it was likely the older doctors’ patients fared worse because of it. Only two of sixty-two studies had found doctors to have gotten better with experience. Another study of decision-making accuracy in more than ten thousand clinicians found that additional professional experience had only a very small benefit. Not surprisingly, the same thing is true for nurses as well. Careful studies have shown that very experienced nurses do not, on average, provide any better care than nurses who are only a few years out of nursing school.*

*In short, doctors are clearly serious about keeping their skills sharp. Unfortunately, the way they have been doing it just isn’t working. Several researchers have examined the benefits of continuing medical education for practicing physicians, and the consensus is that while it is not exactly worthless, it’s not doing much good, either. But to the credit of the medical profession, I have found doctors to be exceptionally willing to look for shortcomings in their fields and search for ways to correct them. It is largely because of this willingness that I have spent so much time working with doctors and other medical professionals. It is not because medical training is less effective than training in other fields, but rather because those in this field are so motivated to find ways to improve. Some of the most compelling research on the effectiveness of continuing professional education for physicians has been done by Dave Davis, a doctor and educational scientist at the University of Toronto. In a very influential study, Davis and a group of colleagues examined a wide-ranging group of educational “interventions,” by which they meant courses, conferences and other meetings, lectures, and symposia, taking part in medical rounds, and pretty much anything else whose goal was to increase doctors’ knowledge and improve their performance. The most effective interventions, Davis found, were those that had some interactive component—role-play, discussion groups, case solving, hands-on training, and the like. Such activities actually did improve both the doctors’ performance and their patients’ outcomes, although the overall improvement was small. By contrast, the least effective activities were “didactic” interventions—that is, those educational activities that essentially consisted of doctors listening to a lecture—which, sadly enough, are by far the most common types of activities in continuing medical education. Davis concluded that this sort of passive listening to lectures had no significant effect at all on either doctors’ performance or on how well their patients fared.*  

- Page 145 (location ~ 2219-2234)    

*That group’s conclusions were similar to Davis’s: continuing medical education can improve doctors’ performance, but the effect is small, and the effects on patient outcomes are even smaller. In addition, it is mainly those education approaches with some interactive component that have an effect; lectures, seminars, and the like do little or nothing to help doctors improve their practice. Finally, the researchers found that no type of continuing medical education is effective at improving complex behaviors, that is, behaviors that involve a number of steps or require considering a number of different factors. In other words, to the extent that continuing medical education is effective,*

In other words, to the extent that continuing medical education is effective, it is effective in changing only the most basic things that doctors do in their practices.*

*There is a saying in medicine about learning surgical procedures that can be traced back to William Halsted, a surgical pioneer in the early twentieth century: “See one, do one, teach one.” The idea is that all surgical trainees need in order to be able to carry out a new surgery is to see it done once and, after that, they can figure out how to do it by themselves on succeeding patients. It is the ultimate profession of faith in knowledge versus skill. However, this faith was severely challenged in the 1980s and 1990s with the spread of laparoscopic surgery, or keyhole surgery, in which a surgery is performed with instruments inserted through a small opening in the body that may be well away from the surgical site. It required techniques that were radically different from those of traditional surgery, yet the general assumption was that experienced surgeons should be able to pick up this new technique relatively quickly without extra training. After all, they had all the necessary knowledge to carry out the procedures. However, when medical researchers compared the learning curves of surgeons who had a great deal of experience in traditional surgery with the learning curves of surgical trainees, they found no difference in how quickly the two groups mastered laparoscopic surgery and reduced the numbers of complications.*  

- Page 147 (location ~ 2254-2263)    

*In short, neither their greater knowledge nor their greater experience in traditional surgery gave the experienced surgeons an advantage in developing skill in laparoscopic surgery. That skill, it turns out, must be developed independently. Because of these findings, surgeons today who wish to perform laparoscopic procedures must go through training supervised by expert laparoscopic surgeons and be tested on this specific skill.*  

- Page 148 (location ~ 2263-2266)    

*As we’ve seen with the Top Gun approach and Art Turock’s work, there are ways to immediately apply the principles of deliberate practice to improve skills in professional and business settings. But over the long term I believe the best approach will be to develop new skills-based training programs that will supplement or completely replace the knowledge-based approaches that are the norm now in many places. This strategy acknowledges that because what is ultimately most important is what people are able to do, training should focus on doing rather than on knowing—and, in particular, on bringing everyone’s skills closer to the level of the best performers in a given area.*

*In 2007, a group of researchers led by Andrew Vickers of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City reported the outcomes for nearly eight thousand men with prostate cancer who had had their prostates surgically removed. The procedures had been done by seventy-two different surgeons at four medical centers between 1987 and 2003. The goal of such surgeries is to remove the entire prostate gland along with any cancer in the surrounding tissue. This complex operation requires painstaking care and skill, and if it is not done exactly right, cancer is more likely to recur. Thus, the success rate in preventing a recurrence of cancer after this operation should offer an objective measure that can separate the best surgeons from the rest. And this is what Vickers and his colleagues found: There was a major difference in skill between surgeons who had had a great deal of experience with this surgery and those who had relatively few such operations under their belts. While surgeons who had performed just 10 prostatectomies had a five-year cancer recurrence rate of 17.9 percent, those who had performed 250 prior surgeries had a recurrence rate of just 10.7 percent. In other words, you were almost twice as likely to have your cancer come back within five years if you were operated on by an inexperienced surgeon than if you were operated on by an experienced one.*

*Deliberate practice–based techniques to build surgical skills could be particularly valuable because it is clear from this study and others like it that surgeons need years and many surgeries to reach a point at which they can be considered experts. If training programs could be developed that halved the time a surgeon needs to reach expert status, it could make a major difference to patients. A pattern of improvement similar to what Vickers observed in surgeons was seen in a study of radiologists interpreting mammograms. The radiologists improved considerably in their interpretations over the first three years they spent on the job, coming up with fewer and fewer false positives—that is, cases in which women did not have breast cancer but were called in for further screening—and then their rate of improvement slowed down sharply. Interestingly, this improvement over the first three years occurred only for radiologists who had not had fellowship training in radiology. Those doctors who had gone through a radiology fellowship did not have the same sort of learning curve but instead took only a few months on the job to reach the same skill level that the nonfellowship radiologists took three years to develop.*

*Research into the mental processes of the best doctors has shown that while they may have prepared surgical plans before they start, they regularly monitor the surgeries in progress and are ready to switch gears if necessary. This was apparent from a series of recent studies done by medical researchers in Canada who observed operations that the surgeons had predicted would be challenging. When the researchers interviewed the surgeons after the operations about their thought processes during the surgery, they found that the main way the surgeons detected problems was by noticing that something about the surgery didn’t match the way they had visualized the surgery in their preoperative plan. Once they noticed the mismatch, they came up with a list of alternative approaches and decided which was most likely to work. This points to something important about how these experienced surgeons perform: over time they have developed effective mental representations that they use in planning the surgery, in performing it, and in monitoring its progress so that they can detect when something is wrong and adapt accordingly.*

*A year and a half after starting his project, which he called “the Dan Plan,” he gave an interview to Golf magazine. When the writer asked him why he was doing it, Dan gave an answer I really liked. He said he didn’t appreciate the attitude that only certain people can succeed in certain areas—that only those people who are logical and “good at math” can go into mathematics, that only athletic people can go into sports, that only musically gifted people can become really good at playing an instrument. This sort of thinking just gave people an excuse not to pursue things that they might otherwise really enjoy and perhaps even be good at, and he didn’t want to fall into that trap. “That inspired me to try something completely different from anything I’d ever done,” he said. “I wanted to prove that anything’s possible if you’re willing to put in the time.”*  

- Page 156 (location ~ 2392-2398)    

*As we discussed in chapter 3, one of the main purposes of deliberate practice is to develop a set of effective mental representations that can guide your performance, whether you are practicing a karate move, playing a piano sonata, or performing surgery. When you’re practicing by yourself, you have to rely upon your own mental representations to monitor your performance and determine what you might be doing wrong. This is not impossible, but it is much more difficult and less efficient than having an experienced teacher watching you and providing feedback. It is particularly difficult early in the learning process, when your mental representations are still tentative and inaccurate; once you have developed a foundation of solid representations, you work from those to build new and more effective representations on your own.*

*How do you find a good teacher? This process will likely entail some trial and error, but there are a few ways you can improve your chances of success. First, while a good teacher does not have to be one of the best in the world, he or she should be accomplished in the field. Generally speaking, teachers will only be able to guide you to the level that they or their previous students have attained. If you’re a flat-out beginner, any reasonably skilled teacher will do, but once you’ve been training for a few years, you’ll need a teacher who is more advanced. A good teacher should also have some skill and experience in teaching in that field. Many accomplished performers are terrible teachers because they have no idea how to teach. Just because they themselves can do it doesn’t mean they can teach others how to do it. Ask about a teacher’s experience and, if possible, investigate and even talk to the teacher’s former or current students. How good are they? How much of their skill can be attributed to that particular teacher? Do they speak highly of the teacher? The best students to talk to are those who started working with a teacher when they were at about the same level you are now, since their experience will be closest to what you yourself will get from a teacher. Ideally you want to find students similar in age and relevant experience. A teacher might be great with children and adolescents but have less experience with and understanding of how to help someone a few decades older.*

*Dan McLaughlin of the Dan Plan offers a good—if extreme—example of how to use instructors to improve. Dan had read about deliberate practice and had absorbed many of its lessons, so from the beginning of his quest he understood the importance of personal instruction. Before he even began, he’d already recruited three instructors: a golf coach, a strength-and-conditioning coach, and a nutritionist. Dan’s later experience illustrates one final lesson about instruction: you may need to change teachers as you yourself change. For several years he improved with his original golf coach, but at some point he stopped getting better. He had absorbed everything this coach could teach him, and he was ready to find a coach at the next level. If you find yourself at a point where you are no longer improving quickly or at all, don’t be afraid to look for a new instructor. The most important thing is to keep moving forward.*  

- Page 160 (location ~ 2451-2457)    

*This goes back to the basic principle we talked about in the first chapter—the importance of engaging in purposeful practice instead of mindless repetition without any clear plan for getting better. If you want to improve in chess, you don’t do it by playing chess; you do it with solitary study of the grandmasters’ games. If you want to improve in darts, you don’t do it by going to the bar with your friends and letting the loser buy the next round; you do it by spending some time alone working on reproducing your throwing motion exactly from one throw to the next. You improve your control by systematically varying the point on the dartboards that you aim at. If you want to get better at bowling, those Thursday nights with your bowling league team won’t do much good. You’ll want to spend some quality alley time on your own—ideally, working on difficult pin configurations in which being able to control exactly where the ball goes is essential. And so on. Remember: if your mind is wandering or you’re relaxed and just having fun, you probably won’t improve.*

*After carrying out an extended study of Olympic swimmers, the researcher Daniel Chambliss concluded that the key to excellence in swimming lay in maintaining close attention to every detail of performance, “each one done correctly, time and again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit.” This is the recipe for maximum improvement from your practice. Even in those sports such as bodybuilding or long-distance running, where much of the practice consists of seemingly mindless, repetitive actions, paying attention performing those actions the right way will lead to greater improvement. Researchers who have studied long-distance runners have found that amateurs tend to daydream or think about more pleasant subjects to take their minds off the pain and strain of their running, while elite long-distance runners remain attuned to their bodies so that they can find the optimal pace and make adjustments to maintain the best pace throughout the whole race. In bodybuilding or weightlifting, if you are going to attempt to lift a weight at the maximum of your current ability, you need to prepare before the lift and be completely focused during the lift. Any activity at the limits of your ability will require full concentration and effort. And, of course, in fields where strength and endurance are not so important—intellectual activities, musical performance, art, and so on—there is little point at all to practicing if you don’t focus.*  

- Page 164 (location ~ 2505-2515)    

*The advice I offered to Per Holmlöv in this area can be applied to just about anyone who is getting started on deliberate practice: Focus and concentration are crucial, I wrote, so shorter training sessions with clearer goals are the best way to develop new skills faster. It is better to train at 100 percent effort for less time than at 70 percent effort for a longer period. Once you find you can no longer focus effectively, end the session. And make sure you get enough sleep so that you can train with maximum concentration. Per took my advice. He had arranged to get personal sessions with his sensei, he was doing shorter training sessions but at a higher level of concentration, and he was getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night and a nap after lunch. He had passed his green belt test, and his next goal was the blue belt. At seventy years old he was halfway to black belt, and as long as he stayed injury free, he was confident he would reach that goal before he turned eighty.*

*Maybe you can’t afford a teacher, or there is no one easily accessible to teach what you want to learn. Maybe you’re interested in improving in some area where there are no experts, or at least no teachers. Whatever the reasons are, it is still possible to improve if you follow some basic principles from deliberate practice—many of which Franklin seems to have intuited on his own. The hallmark of purposeful or deliberate practice is that you try to do something you cannot do—that takes you out of your comfort zone—and that you practice it over and over again, focusing on exactly how you are doing it, where you are falling short, and how you can get better. Real life—our jobs, our schooling, our hobbies—seldom gives us the opportunity for this sort of focused repetition, so in order to improve, we must manufacture our own opportunities. Franklin did it with his exercises, each focused on a particular facet of writing. Much of what a good teacher or coach will do is to develop such exercises for you, designed specifically to help you improve the particular skill you are focused on at the moment. But without a teacher, you must come up with your own exercises.*

*Another professor at Florida State University, who worked with ESL (English as a second language) students, told me about a student of his who went to the mall and stopped a number of shoppers, asking each the same question. In this way she was able to hear similar answers over and over again, and that repetition made it easier for her to understand the words being spoken by native speakers at full speed. If she had asked different questions each time, it’s likely that her comprehension would have improved little, if at all. Other students who were trying to improve their English would watch the same English movies with subtitles over and over again, covering the subtitles and trying to understand what was being said. To check their comprehension, they would uncover the subtitles. By listening to the same dialogue over and over, they improved their ability to understand English much more quickly than if they’d simply watched a number of different movies. Note that these students weren’t simply doing the same thing over and over again: they were paying attention to what they got wrong each time and correcting it. This is purposeful practice. It does no good to do the same thing over and over again mindlessly; the purpose of the repetition is to figure out where your weaknesses are and focus on getting better in those areas, trying different methods to improve until you find something that works.*  

- Page 168 (location ~ 2576-2586)    

*To effectively practice a skill without a teacher, it helps to keep in mind three Fs: Focus. Feedback. Fix it. Break the skill down into components that you can do repeatedly and analyze effectively, determine your weaknesses, and figure out ways to address them. The ringmaster, the ESL students, and Ben Franklin all exemplified this approach. Franklin’s approach also offers an excellent template for developing mental representations when you have little or no input from instructors. When he analyzed the writing in The Spectator and figured out what made it good, he was—although he didn’t think of it in these terms—creating a mental representation that he could use to guide his own work. The more he practiced, the more highly developed his mental representations became, until he could write at the level of The Spectator without having a concrete example in front of him. He had internalized good writing—which is just another way of saying that he had built mental representations that captured its salient features.*  

- Page 170 (location ~ 2599-2606)    

*We can build effective mental representations in many areas with a similar technique. In music, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s father taught him to compose in part by having him study some of the era’s best composers and copy their work. And in art, aspiring artists have long developed their skills by copying the paintings and sculptures of the masters. Indeed, in some cases they have done this in a way very similar to the technique Franklin used to improve his writing, that is, by studying a piece of art by a master, attempting to reproduce it from memory, and then comparing the finished product with the original in order to discover the differences and correct them. Some artists even become so good at copying that they can make their living as forgers, but that is not usually the point of this exercise. Artists don’t want to produce artwork that looks like someone else’s; they want to develop the skills and the mental representations that make expertise possible and use that expertise to convey their own artistic vision. Despite the first word in the term “mental representation,” pure mental analysis is not nearly enough. We can only form effective mental representations when we try to reproduce what the expert performer can do, fail, figure out why we failed, try again, and repeat—over and over again. Successful mental representations are inextricably tied to actions, not just thoughts, and it is the extended practice aimed at reproducing the original product that will produce the mental representations we seek.*

*In 2005 a young journalist named Joshua Foer came to Tallahassee to interview me about an article that he was writing about memory competitions. These are the sorts of events that I mentioned earlier, where people compete to see who can recall the most digits, who can memorize a random collection of playing cards most quickly, and other similar feats. During our discussions Josh mentioned that he was thinking about competing himself in order to get a first-person perspective and that he was going to start training under a top-ranked memory competitor, Ed Cooke. There was even some vague talk about a book he might write on his experiences in these competitions. Before Josh began working with Cooke, my graduate students and I tested his memory on a wide variety of tasks to see what his baseline abilities were. After that we had little contact for a while, until one day he called me and complained that he’d reached a plateau. No matter how much he practiced, he couldn’t improve the speed with which he memorized the order of a randomly arranged deck of cards. I gave Josh some advice about getting past a plateau, and he went back to training. The whole story is told in his book Moonwalking with Einstein, but the bottom line is this: Josh did indeed speed up considerably, and he ultimately won the 2006 USA Memory Championship. The plateau Josh encountered is common in every sort of training. When you first start learning something new, it is normal to see rapid—or at least steady—improvement, and when that improvement stops, it is natural to believe you’ve hit some sort of implacable limit. So you stop trying to move forward, and you settle down to life on that plateau. This is the major reason that people in every area stop improving.*

*People who learn to type with the classic ten-finger method, where each finger is assigned to certain keys, will eventually reach a certain comfortable speed at which they can type maybe thirty or forty words per minute with relatively few mistakes. This is their plateau. Typing teachers use a well-established method to get past such a plateau. Most typists can increase their typing speed by 10–20 percent simply by focusing and pushing themselves to type faster. The problem is that as their concentration lags, their typing speed returns to the plateau. To counter this, a teacher will typically suggest setting aside fifteen to twenty minutes a day to type at this faster speed. This does two things: First, it helps the student spot challenges—such as particular letter combinations—that slow down their typing. Once you figure out what the problems are, you can design exercises to improve your speed in those situations. For instance, if you’re having a problem typing “ol” or “lo” because the letter o is almost directly above the letter l, you could practice typing a series of words that contain those combinations—old, cold, roll, toll, low, lot, lob, lox, follow, hollow, and so on—over and over again. Second, when you type faster than usual, it forces you to start looking ahead at the words that are coming up so that you can figure out where to place your fingers in anticipation. So, if you see that the next four letters will all be typed by fingers on your left hand, you can move the correct finger on your right hand into place for the fifth letter ahead. Tests on the best typists have shown that their speeds are closely related to how far ahead they look at upcoming letters while they type.*

*I suggested to Josh that if he wanted to speed up the pace at which he could memorize the order of a deck of cards, he should try to do it in less time than it normally took and then look to see where his mistakes were coming from. By identifying exactly what was slowing him down, he could come up with exercises to improve his speed on those particular things instead of simply trying, over and over again, to produce some generalized improvement that would decrease the amount of time he spent on an entire deck of cards. This, then, is what you should try when other techniques for getting past a plateau have failed. First, figure out exactly what is holding you back. What mistakes are you making, and when? Push yourself well outside of your comfort zone and see what breaks down first. Then design a practice technique aimed at improving that particular weakness. Once you’ve figured out what the problem is, you may be able to fix it yourself, or you may need to go to an experienced coach or teacher for suggestions. Either way, pay attention to what happens when you practice; if you are not improving, you will need to try something else. The power of this technique is that it targets those specific problem areas that are holding you back rather than trying this and that and hoping that something works. This technique is not widely recognized, even among experienced teachers, even though it might seem obvious as described here and is a remarkably effective way to rise above plateaus.*

*The best spellers had also spent more time on being quizzed, but the amount of time they spent in purposeful practice correlated more closely with how well they did in the spelling bee. What we were really interested in, however, was what motivated these students to spend so much time studying the spelling of words. The students who win the regional competitions and go on to compete in the national spelling bee—even those who don’t end up among the top spellers at the event—put in incredible amounts of practice time in the months before the competition. Why? In particular, what drove the very best spellers to put in so much more time than the others? Some people had suggested that the students who had spent the most time practicing did so because they actually liked this sort of studying and got some sort of pleasure out of it. But the answers the students gave to our questionnaire told a very different story: they didn’t like studying at all. None of them did, including the very best spellers. The hours they had spent studying thousands of words alone were not fun; they would have been quite happy to do something else. Instead, what distinguished the most successful spellers was their superior ability to remain committed to studying despite the boredom and the pull of other, more appealing activities. How do you keep going? That is perhaps the biggest question that anyone engaged in purposeful or deliberate practice will eventually face. Getting started is easy, as anyone who has visited a gym after New Year’s knows. You decide that you want to get in shape or learn to play the guitar or pick up a new language, and so you jump right in. It’s exciting. It’s energizing. You can imagine how good it will feel to be twenty pounds lighter or to play “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” Then after a while, reality hits. It’s hard to find the time to work out or practice as much as you should, so you start missing sessions. You’re not improving as fast as you thought you would. It stops being fun, and your resolve to reach your goal weakens. Eventually you stop altogether, and you don’t start up again. Call it “the New Year’s resolution effect”—it’s why gyms that were crowded in January are only half full in July and why so many slightly used guitars are available on Craigslist. So that’s the problem in a nutshell: purposeful practice is hard work. It’s hard to keep going, and even if you keep up your training—you go to the gym regularly, or you practice the guitar for a certain number of hours every week—it’s hard to maintain focus and effort, so you may eventually stop pushing yourself and stop improving.*

*But there is a bigger, second problem with the concept of willpower, one related to the myth of natural talent, which we will discuss later in chapter 8. Both willpower and natural talent are traits that people assign to someone after the fact: Jason is an incredible tennis player, so he must have been born with this natural talent. Jackie practiced the violin for years, several hours each day, so she must have incredible willpower. In neither case can we make this determination ahead of time with any likelihood of being right, and in neither case has anyone ever identified any genes that underlie these supposed innate characteristics, so there is no more scientific evidence for the existence of individual genes that determine willpower than there is for the existence of genes that are necessary for succeeding in chess or piano-playing. Furthermore, once you assume that something is innate, it automatically becomes something you can’t do anything about: If you don’t have innate musical talent, forget about ever being a good musician. If you don’t have enough willpower, forget about ever taking on something that will require a great deal of hard work. This sort of circular thinking—“The fact that I couldn’t keep practicing indicates that I don’t have enough willpower, which explains why I couldn’t keep practicing”—is worse than useless; it is damaging in that it can convince people that they might as well not even try.*  

- Page 179 (location ~ 2732-2742)    

*It is much more useful, I believe, to talk about motivation. Motivation is quite different from willpower. We all have various motivations—some stronger, some weaker—at various times and in various situations. The most important question to answer then becomes, What factors shape motivation? By asking such a question, we can home in on the factors that might boost the motivation of our employees, children, students, and ourselves. There are some interesting parallels between improving performance and losing weight. People who are overweight generally have little difficulty starting a diet program, and they will generally lose some weight on it. But almost all of them will eventually see their progress stop, and most of those will gradually regain the weight they lost, putting them right back where they started. The ones who are successful in losing weight over the long run are those who have successfully redesigned their lives, building new habits that allow them to maintain the behaviors that keep them losing weight in spite of all of the temptations that threaten their success. A similar thing is true for those who maintain purposeful or deliberate practice over the long run. They have generally developed various habits that help them keep going. As a rule of thumb, I think that anyone who hopes to improve skill in a particular area should devote an hour or more each day to practice that can be done with full concentration. Maintaining the motivation that enables such a regimen has two parts: reasons to keep going and reasons to stop. When you quit something that you had initially wanted to do, it’s because the reasons to stop eventually came to outweigh the reasons to continue. Thus, to maintain your motivation you can either strengthen the reasons to keep going or weaken the reasons to quit. Successful motivation efforts generally include both. There are various ways to weaken the reasons to quit. One of the most effective is to set aside a fixed time to practice that has been cleared of all other obligations and distractions. It can be difficult enough to push yourself to practice in the best of situations, but when you have other things you could be doing, there is a constant temptation to do something else and to justify it by telling yourself that it really needs to get done. If you do this often enough, you begin practicing less and less, and soon your training program is in a death spiral.*  

- Page 179 (location ~ 2743-2760)    

*More generally, look for anything that might interfere with your training and find ways to minimize its influence. If you’re likely to be distracted by your smartphone, turn it off. Or better yet, turn it off and leave it in another room. If you’re not a morning person and you find it particularly difficult to exercise in the morning, move your run or your exercise class to later in the day when your body won’t fight you so much. I’ve noticed that some people who have difficulty getting started in the morning don’t get enough sleep. Ideally you should wake up by yourself (that is, without an alarm to wake you) and feel refreshed when you do. If that’s not the case, you might need to go to bed earlier. While any given factor may make only a small difference, the various factors add up. For purposeful or deliberate practice to be effective, you need to push yourself outside your comfort zone and maintain your focus, but those are mentally draining activities. Expert performers do two things—both seemingly unrelated to motivation—that can help. The first is general physical maintenance: getting enough sleep and keeping healthy. If you’re tired or sick, it’s that much harder to maintain focus and that much easier to slack off. As I mentioned in chapter 4, the violin students were all careful to get a good night’s sleep each night, and many of them would take an early afternoon nap after their morning practice session. The second thing is to limit the length of your practice sessions to about an hour. You can’t maintain intense concentration for much longer than that—and when you’re first starting out, it’s likely to be less. If you want to practice longer than an hour, go for an hour and take a break.*  

- Page 181 (location ~ 2767-2780)    

*Studies of expert performers tell us that once you have practiced for a while and can see the results, the skill itself can become part of your motivation. You take pride in what you do, you get pleasure from your friends’ compliments, and your sense of identity changes. You begin to see yourself as a public speaker or a piccolo player or a maker of origami figures. As long as you recognize this new identity as flowing from the many hours of practice that you devoted to developing your skill, further practice comes to feel more like an investment than an expense. Another key motivational factor in deliberate practice is a belief that you can succeed. In order to push yourself when you really don’t feel like it, you must believe that you can improve and—particularly for people shooting to become expert performers—that you can rank among the best. The power of such belief is so strong that it can even trump reality.*

*The psychologist Benjamin Bloom once directed a project that examined the childhoods of a number of experts in various fields. One of his findings was that when these future experts were young, their parents would use various strategies to keep them from quitting. In particular, several of the experts told of a time in their youth when they were sick or injured in some way that prevented them from practicing for a significant amount of time. When they eventually resumed practicing, they weren’t at nearly the same level they had been at before, and, discouraged, they wanted to quit. Their parents told them that they could quit if they wished but that first they needed to keep practicing enough to get back to where they were. And this did the trick. Once they’d practiced for a while and gotten back to where they were, they realized that they could indeed keep getting better and that their setback was just temporary. Belief is important. You may not be lucky enough to have someone do for you what Hägg’s father did for him, but you can certainly take a lesson from the expert performers that Bloom studied: if you stop believing that you can reach a goal, either because you’ve regressed or you’ve plateaued, don’t quit. Make an agreement with yourself that you will do what it takes to get back to where you were or to get beyond the plateau, and then you can quit. You probably won’t.*

*One of the best ways to create and sustain social motivation is to surround yourself with people who will encourage and support and challenge you in your endeavors. Not only did the Berlin violin students spend most of their time with other music students, but they also tended to date music students or at least others who would appreciate their passion for music and understand their need to prioritize their practice. Surrounding yourself with supportive people is easiest in activities that are done in groups or teams. If you’re part of an orchestra, for example, you may find yourself motivated to practice harder because you don’t want to let your colleagues down, or because you’re competing with some of them to be the best at your instrument, or perhaps both. The members of a baseball or softball team may collectively push to improve in order to win a championship, but they will also be aware of the internal competitions with other members of the team and will likely be motivated by those competitions as well. Perhaps the most important factor here, though, is the social environment itself. Deliberate practice can be a lonely pursuit, but if you have a group of friends who are in the same positions—the other members of your orchestra or your baseball team or your chess club—you have a built-in support system. These people understand the effort you’re putting into your practice, they can share training tips with you, and they can appreciate your victories and commiserate with you over your difficulties. They count on you, and you can count on them.*

*Which brings us back to Benjamin Franklin again. As a young man he was interested in all sorts of intellectual pursuits—philosophy, science, invention, writing, the arts, and so on—and he wished to encourage his own development in those areas. So at twenty-one he recruited eleven of the most intellectually interesting people in Philadelphia to form a mutual improvement club, which he named “the Junto.” The club’s members, who met each Friday night, would encourage each other’s various intellectual pursuits. Every member was expected to bring at least one interesting topic of conversation—on morals, politics, or science—to each meeting. The topics, which were generally phrased as questions, were to be discussed by the group “in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory.” In order to keep the discussions open and collaborative, the Junto’s rules strictly forbade anyone from contradicting another member or expressing an opinion too strongly. And once every three months each member of the Junto had to compose an essay—on any topic whatsoever—and read it to the rest of the group, which would then discuss*

*This technique can be used in nearly any area: put together a group of people all interested in the same thing—or join an existing group—and use the group’s camaraderie and shared goals as extra motivation in reaching your own goals. This is the idea behind many social organizations, from book clubs to chess clubs to community theaters, and joining—or, if necessary, forming—such a group can be a tremendous way for adults to maintain motivation. One thing to be careful about, however, is to make sure that the other members of the group have similar goals for improvement. If you join a bowling team because you are trying to improve your bowling scores and the rest of the team is mainly interested in having a good time, with little concern about whether they win the league title, you’re going to be frustrated, not motivated. If you’re a guitarist looking to improve enough to make a career out of music, don’t join a band whose members just want to get together in someone’s garage on Saturday nights and jam. (But do keep in mind that Junto would be a really good name for a rock band.) Of course,*

*How do you maintain motivation for hour after hour of such focused practice? One of the best bits of advice is to set things up so that you are constantly seeing concrete signs of improvement, even if it is not always major improvement. Break your long journey into a manageable series of goals and focus on them one at a time—perhaps even giving yourself a small reward each time you reach a goal. Piano teachers know, for example, that it is best to break down long-term targets for a young piano student into a series of levels. By doing this, the student gets a sense of achievement each time a new level is attained, and that sense of achievement will both add to his or her motivation and make it less likely that the student will become discouraged by a seeming lack of progress. It doesn’t matter if the levels are arbitrary. What matters is that the teacher divides up what can look like an infinite amount of material to learn into a series of clear steps, making the student’s progress more concrete and more encouraging.*

*We still don’t know if Dan will achieve his goal of playing on the PGA Tour, but he has clearly shown how a thirty-year-old man with no real golf experience can, with the right sort of practice, turn himself into an expert golfer. My inbox is full of stories like this. A psychotherapist from Denmark who used deliberate practice to develop her singing and eventually recorded songs that have gotten airplay on radio stations all over Denmark. A mechanical engineer from Florida who developed his painting skills through deliberate practice and sent me a picture of his first-ever painting, which was really quite good. A Brazilian engineer who decided to devote ten thousand hours (that number again!) to becoming an origami expert. And so on. The only two things that all these people have in common are that they all have had a dream and that they’ve all realized, after learning about deliberate practice, that there is a path to achieving that dream. And this, more than anything else, is the lesson that people should take away from all these stories and all this research: There is no reason not to follow your dream. Deliberate practice can open the door to a world of possibilities that you may have been convinced were out of reach. Open that door.*

*The Polgárs were blessed with three children, all of them girls. All the better to prove László’s point. Their first daughter, born in April 1969, was named Susan (in Hungarian, Zsuzsanna). Sofia (Zsófia) followed in November 1974, and then Judit in July 1976. László and Klara home-schooled their daughters in order to spend as much time as possible focusing on chess. It didn’t take long for the Polgárs’ experiment to become a tremendous success. Susan was just four years old when she won her first tournament, dominating the Budapest Girls’ Under-11 Championship with ten wins, no losses, and no ties. At fifteen, she became the top-ranked woman chess player in the world, and she went on to become the first woman to be awarded grandmaster status via the same path that the males must take. (Two other women had been named grandmasters after winning female-only world championships.) And Susan wouldn’t even be the most accomplished of the girls.*  

- Page 191 (location ~ 2928-2935)    

*Judit was the crown jewel of László Polgár’s experiment. She became a grandmaster at fifteen years, five months, making her at that time the youngest person, male or female, to ever reach that level. She was the number-one-ranked women’s chess player in the world for twenty-five years, until she retired from chess in 2014. At one time she was ranked number eight in the world among all chess players, male or female, and in 2005 she became the first—and so far only—woman to play in the overall World Chess Championship. The Polgár sisters were all clearly experts. Each of them became among the very best in the world in an area in which the measured performance is extremely objective. There are no style points in chess. Your school background doesn’t matter. Your résumé doesn’t count. So we know without any doubts just how good they were, and they were very, very good. And while some details of their background are unusual—very few parents are so focused on turning their children into the best in the world at something—they provide a clear, if somewhat extreme, example of what it takes to become an expert performer. The paths that Susan, Sofia, and Judit took to chess mastery are in line with the path that essentially all experts have taken to become extraordinary. In particular, psychologists have found that an expert’s development passes through four distinct stages, from the first glimmers of interest to full-fledged expertise. Everything we know about the Polgár sisters suggests that they went through those same stages, if perhaps in a slightly different fashion because of how their father directed their development.*

*More broadly, this chapter provides a step-by-step look at what is required to take full advantage of human adaptability and reach the frontier of human capabilities. Typically that process begins in childhood or early adolescence and proceeds for a decade or more until the expert level is reached. But it doesn’t stop there. One of the hallmarks of expert performers is that even once they become one of the best at what they do, they still constantly strive to improve their practice techniques and to get better. And it is here at the frontier that we find the pathbreakers, those experts who go beyond what anyone else has ever done and show us all what it is possible to achieve.*  

- Page 194 (location ~ 2963-2968)    

*It is interesting to note the difference between Susan’s memory of how she got interested in chess and what we know about her parents’ plans for her. László and Klara had already decided that Susan would become a top-ranked chess player, so they would have hardly counted on her just happening to find the chess pieces and becoming fascinated with them. The precise details are not important, however. What is important is that Susan became interested in chess as a child—and that she became interested in the only way that a child of that age (she was three at the time) could become interested: she saw the chess pieces as fun. As toys. As something to play with. Young children are very curious and playful. Like puppies or kittens, they interact with the world mostly through play. This desire to play serves as a child’s initial motivation to try out one thing or another, to see what is interesting and what is not, and to engage in various activities that will help them build their skills.*  

- Page 194 (location ~ 2971-2978)    

*In this first stage, the children don’t practice per se—that will come later—but many children do manage to come up with activities that are part play, part training. A good example is Mario Lemieux, widely considered to be one of the best hockey players to ever take to the ice. He had two older brothers, Alain and Richard, and the three of them would regularly go down to the basement of the family home, where they would slide around on their socked feet as if on ice skates and knock a bottle cap around with wooden kitchen spoons. Another is the British hurdler David Hemery—one of the best British track athletes ever—who turned many of his childhood activities into competitions with himself, challenging himself to constantly improve. When given a pogo stick for Christmas, for example, he stacked telephone books in order to practice jumping over obstacles. Although I don’t know of any studies that look at the value of this sort of play practice, it seems likely that these children were taking their first steps down the path toward expertise. Mario Lemieux’s experience points up another salient feature of prodigies’ early experience—how many of them had older siblings to be inspired by, to learn from, to compete with, and to model themselves after. Judit Polgár had Susan and Sofia. Wolfgang Mozart had Maria Anna, who was four and a half years older and who was already playing the harpsichord when Wolfgang first became interested in music. Tennis great Serena Williams followed in the footsteps of her sister Venus Williams, who was herself one of the best tennis players of the current era. Mikaela Shiffrin, who became the youngest slalom champion in history during the Olympic Games in 2014, had an older brother, Taylor, who was a competitive skier. And so on. This is yet another sort of motivation. A child who sees an older sibling performing an activity and getting attention and praise from a parent will naturally want to join in and garner some attention and praise as well. For some children, competition with the sibling may itself be motivating, too.*  

- Page 197 (location ~ 3008-3023)    

*Once a future expert performer becomes interested and shows some promise in an area, the typical next step is to take lessons from a coach or teacher. At this point, most of these students encounter deliberate practice for the first time. Unlike their experiences up to this point, which have been mainly playful activities, their practice is about to become work. In general, the instructors who introduce the students to this sort of practice are not experts themselves, but they are good at working with children. They know how to motivate their students and keep them moving forward as they adapt to the work of improving through deliberate practice. These teachers are enthusiastic and encouraging and reward their students—with praise or sometimes more concretely with candy or other small treats—when the students have accomplished something.*  

- Page 199 (location ~ 3042-3048)    

*In the case of the Polgár sisters, László was their first teacher. He was not a particularly strong chess player—all of his daughters surpassed him well before their teenage years—but he knew enough to give them a good start on chess, and, most importantly, he kept them interested in the game. Judit has said that her father was the best motivator she had ever met. And this is perhaps the most important factor in the early days of an expert’s development—maintaining that interest and motivation while the skills and habits are being built.*  

- Page 199 (location ~ 3048-3052)    

*Parents have an important role to play, as well. (In the Polgárs’ case, of course, László was both parent and teacher.) Parents help their children establish routines—say, practicing the piano for an hour each day—and they give them support and encouragement and praise them for improvements. They will, when necessary, push the children to prioritize their practice above other activities: practice first, play later. And if the children struggle too much to maintain their practice schedule, the parents may step in with more extreme measures. Some parents of Bloom’s future experts had to resort to tactics like threatening to cut off piano lessons and sell the piano or to no longer take the child to swim practice. Obviously all of the future expert performers decided at this juncture that they wanted to keep going. Others might choose otherwise. While there are various ways that parents and teachers can motivate children, the motivation must ultimately be something that comes from within the child, or else it won’t endure. Parents of small children can motivate them with praise and rewards, among other things, but eventually that will not be enough. One way that parents and teachers can provide long-term motivation is to help the children find related activities that they enjoy. For example, if a child discovers that he or she loves playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, that may be enough to motivate the child to put in the necessary practice. Helping children develop mental representations can also increase motivation by increasing their ability to appreciate the skill they are learning. Representations of music help a child better enjoy listening to music performances and, in particular, to enjoy playing one’s favorite pieces for oneself in the practice room. Representations of chess positions lead to a greater appreciation of the beauty of the game. Representations of a baseball game allow a child to understand and admire the strategy that underlies the play.*

*Bloom found a different pattern of interest and motivation among children who would become mathematicians, in large part because they started much later in their areas of interest. Parents don’t usually hire special tutors to instruct their six-year-olds in mathematics. Instead, the future mathematicians first encountered serious mathematics courses—such as algebra, geometry, and calculus—in middle school and high school, and it was often the teachers in these courses, rather than their parents, who first stoked what would become their lifetime passion. The best teachers didn’t focus on the rules for solving particular problems but rather encouraged their students to think about general patterns and processes—the why more than the how. This was motivating to these children because it sparked an intellectual interest that would drive their studies and, later, their research as mathematicians.*  

- Page 200 (location ~ 3066-3072)    

*David Pariser, a researcher at Concordia University in Montreal, found a similar motivation in children who grew up to be gifted artists. They had a “self-fueling, self-motivating drive for tremendous work,” he reported, although they still required “emotional and technical support” from their parents and teachers. Bloom found that after two to five years at this stage, the future experts began to identify themselves more in terms of the skill they were developing and less in terms of other areas of interest, such as school or social life. They saw themselves as “pianists” or “swimmers” by the age of eleven or twelve or as “mathematicians” before they turned sixteen or seventeen. They were becoming serious about what they did.*

*We can’t answer that question yet, but we do know that people who develop skills in a certain area through years of practice seem to get a great deal of pleasure from engaging in that skill. Musicians enjoy performing music. Mathematicians enjoy doing mathematics. Soccer players enjoy playing soccer. Of course, it is possible that this is completely due to a self-selection process—that the only people who would spend years practicing something are those who naturally love to do it—but it is also possible that the practice itself may lead to physiological adaptations that produce more enjoyment and more motivation to do that particular activity. That is nothing but speculation at this point, but it is reasonable speculation.*

*Generally when they’re in their early or mid teens, the future experts make a major commitment to becoming the best that they can be. This commitment is the third stage. Now students will often seek out the best teachers or schools for their training, even if it requires moving across country. In most cases that teacher will be someone who has reached the highest levels in the field him- or herself—a concert pianist turned teacher, a swimming coach who has trained Olympic athletes, a top research mathematician, and so on. It is generally not easy to be accepted into these programs, and acceptance means that the teacher shares the student’s belief that he or she can reach the highest levels. The student faces expectations that gradually increase until the student is, in essence, doing as much as is humanly possible to improve. Swimmers are pushed to constantly improve on their personal best and, ultimately, to pursue national and even international record times. Pianists are expected to perfect their performance on increasingly difficult pieces.*

*In 2014, Money magazine estimated how much it cost a family to train a child who was an elite tennis player. Private lessons will cost $4,500 to $5,000 plus another $7,000 to $8,000 for group lessons. Court time will run you from $50 to $100 an hour. The entrance fee for a national tournament is about $150 plus transportation costs, and the best players compete in twenty or so tournaments a year. Bringing your coach along will cost another $300 a day plus transportation, lodging, and meals. Add all that up, and it’s easy to spend $30,000 a year. But many of the really serious students head off to tennis academies where they train year-round, which can increase expenses dramatically. Attending the IMG Academy in Florida, for instance, will cost you $71,400 a year for tuition, room, and board—and you still have to pay to attend whatever tournaments you choose to play in. Not surprisingly, Bloom reported that very few families could afford to have more than one child pursue this level of performance. Not only is it expensive, but it can be almost a full-time job for a parent to support the student in this pursuit—driving to and from practice during the week, providing transportation to competitions on the weekend, and so on.*

*The most obvious performance issues are those that involve physical abilities. In the general population physical performance peaks around age twenty. With increasing age we lose flexibility, we become more prone to injury, and we take longer to heal. We slow down. Athletes typically attain their peak performance sometime during their twenties. Professional athletes can remain competitive in their thirties or even early forties, with recent advances in training. In fact, people can train effectively well into their eighties. Much of the age-related deterioration in various skills happens because people decrease or stop their training; older people who continue to train regularly see their performance decrease much less. There are master’s divisions in track and field competitions with age brackets up to eighty and beyond, and the people who train for these events do so in precisely the same way that people who are decades younger do; they just train for shorter periods with less intensity because of the increased risk of injury and the increased amount of time the body takes to recover from training. And with the realization that age is not the limitation it was once thought to be, more and more older adults are training harder and harder. Indeed, during the last few decades the performance of master athletes has improved at a much higher rate than that of younger athletes. Today, for example, a quarter of marathon runners in their sixties can be expected to outperform more than half of their competitors between the ages of twenty and fifty-four. One of the oldest people to participate in these master’s events is Don Pellmann, who in 2015 became the first person 100 years old or older to run one hundred meters in less than twenty-seven seconds. At the same track and field event—the San Diego Senior Olympics—Pellmann set four other age-group records as well—for the high jump, long jump, discus, and shot put. There are a number of athletes competing in Pellmann’s current age group, which includes competitors from 100 to 104, and the competitions include most of the events in any track and field competition, including the marathon. (The world record time for the marathon in this age group is 8 hours, 25 minutes, 17 seconds, set by Fauja Singh of the United Kingdom in 2011.) The times may be longer, the distances jumped may be shorter, and the heights cleared may be lower, but these athletes are still going.*

*For example, if ballet dancers are to develop the classic turnout—the ability to rotate the entire leg, beginning at the hip, so that it points directly to the side—they must start early. If they wait until after their hip and knee joints calcify—which typically happens between the ages of eight and twelve years—they’ll probably never be able to get a full turnout. The same sort of thing is true for the shoulders of athletes, like baseball pitchers, whose sport requires them to throw a ball with an overhead motion. Only those who start training at an early age will have the requisite range of motion as adults, with the throwing arm able to be stretched well back behind the shoulder to produce the classic wind-up. And something similar holds true with the motion tennis players use when serving—only those who start young have the full range of the serving motion.*

*The body and the brain both are more adaptable during childhood and adolescence than they are in adulthood, but in most ways they remain adaptable to some degree throughout life. The relationship between age and adaptability varies considerably according to exactly which characteristic you have in mind, and the patterns are very different for mental adaptations than for physical ones. Consider the various ways that musical training can affect the brain. Studies have shown that some parts of the brain are larger in musicians than in nonmusicians, but there are certain parts of the brain for which this is true only if the musician began studying music as a young child. Researchers have found proof of this, for example, in the corpus callosum, the collection of tissue that connects the brain’s hemispheres and serves as the communications path between them. The corpus callosum is significantly larger in adult musicians than in adult nonmusicians, but a closer look finds that it is really only larger in musicians who started practicing before they were seven.*  

- Page 207 (location ~ 3166-3174)    

*How adult brains learn is a relatively new and rather exciting field of study, and it is upending traditional beliefs that our brains become static once adolescence ends. The general lesson is that we can certainly acquire new skills as we age, but the specific way in which we acquire those skills changes as we get older. The human brain has the greatest amount of gray matter—the tissue containing neurons, the nerve fibers that connect the neurons, and the neurons’ support cells—during early adolescence, at which point the brain starts paring down that gray matter. The synapses, the junctions between nerve cells, reach a maximum number early in life; a two-year-old child has about 50 percent more synapses than an adult. The specific details are not so important to us here as the general fact that the brain is constantly developing and changing through the first couple of decades of life, and so the background against which learning takes place is also changing. Thus it makes sense that a six-year-old’s brain learns differently than a fourteen-year-old’s brain, which learns differently than an adult brain—even if all of them are learning the same thing.*  

- Page 208 (location ~ 3180-3188)    

*a study of multilingual people who as adults studied to become simultaneous interpreters found a very different effect on the brain. These simultaneous interpreters actually had less gray matter than people who could speak the same number of languages but who didn’t work as simultaneous interpreters. The researchers who carried out the study speculated that this disparity was because of the different contexts in which the learning took place. When children and adolescents learn new languages, it is against the backdrop of increasing gray matter, and so their learning the additional languages may occur through the addition of gray matter, but when adults continue their focus on multiple languages—this time with an emphasis on simultaneous translation—it is against a backdrop of pruning synapses. Thus the language learning that takes place in adulthood may take place more through getting rid of gray matter—getting rid of some inefficient nerve cells to speed up processes—which would explain why the simultaneous interpreters had less gray matter than other multilingual adults.*

*In 1969 Paul Brady, a researcher at the old Bell Telephone Laboratories, set out on what must have appeared to most to be a quixotic undertaking. At the time he was thirty-two years old, and he had been involved in music all his life. He’d played the piano since he was seven, he had sung in choruses since he was twelve, and he even tuned his own harpsichord. But he had never had perfect pitch or anything close. He had never been able to tell which note on the piano or harpsichord was being played. And because he was an adult, everything that was known about perfect pitch at the time indicated that he had lost his chance—he would never develop perfect pitch, no matter how hard he tried. But Brady was not the sort to believe something was true just because everyone said it was. When he was twenty-one he decided he would try to teach himself to recognize notes. For two weeks he would play an A on his piano and try to remember what it sounded like. No luck. When he would come back a while later, he couldn’t tell an A from a B or a C or a G-sharp. A few years later he tried again with a similar technique and similar results. When he was thirty-two he decided to try again, this time vowing that he would keep working at it until he succeeded. He tried everything he could think of: He spent hours thinking about notes and playing pieces in his head, trying to hear what distinguished one note from another. Nothing. He tried playing piano pieces in different keys with the hope that he could learn to tell the difference between the different keys. Still nothing. After three months he was no closer to perfect pitch than when he had started. Then he was inspired by a paper that described a training technique that had helped musicians without perfect pitch learn to recognize a single note. Brady set up a computer to produce random pure tones—these are tones that consist of a single frequency, unlike a note from a piano, which has a dominant frequency but also a number of other frequencies as well—and he used those pure tones to practice.*  

- Page 210 (location ~ 3208-3223)    

*Brady spent a half hour each day training with the tone generator, and at the end of two months he could identify every one of the twelve notes being played without error. Then, to test whether he had actually trained himself to have perfect pitch, he devised a test with a piano. Each day his wife would play one random note on the piano, and he would try to identify it. She did this for almost two months—fifty-seven days, to be exact—and at the end Brady looked to see how he had done. He had gotten thirty-seven exactly right; he’d missed eighteen by just half a tone—a B-flat instead of a B, for instance—and two by a full tone. Not perfect, but pretty close. Furthermore, the technical definition of perfect pitch actually allows a certain percentage of answers that are off by half a tone, and many people who are accepted by researchers as having perfect pitch actually make such errors themselves. So, by the literal definition of perfect pitch—and by any practical definition as well—Brady had taught himself, with two months of the right sort of practice, to have perfect pitch. The article that Brady wrote describing his accomplishment got relatively little attention over the following decades, probably because he was just one person and he had done the experiment on himself, and researchers continued to assert that there was no convincing evidence that adults could develop perfect pitch.*  

- Page 211 (location ~ 3226-3236)    

*In the mid 1980s a graduate student at Ohio State University, Mark Alan Rush, set out to test that claim with a carefully controlled study that attempted to develop perfect pitch in a group of adults. He decided to use a system designed by David Lucas Burge, who offered a training course that he claimed could help anyone develop perfect pitch. The course—which is still being sold today—spoke about the “colors” of different notes and asked students to listen to notes in such a way that they were paying attention not to such things as the loudness or timbre of the notes, but rather their color. Rush recruited fifty-two undergraduate music majors, half of whom would take Burge’s course in an effort to develop perfect pitch, and half of whom would do nothing. Rush tested their ability to identify notes before and after a nine-month period, during which half of the students were working with Burge’s course. Rush’s results were not exactly a ringing endorsement of Burge’s methods, but they offered encouraging evidence about the possibility of improving one’s ability to recognize notes. At the end of the nine-month period, the control group’s scores were, not surprisingly, pretty much identical with their scores beforehand. But among the other group, a number of undergraduates had improved their judgment about notes. The test involved a total of 120 notes, and Rush kept track both of how many notes they got right and how far off they were on their wrong answers. The student who saw the biggest improvement was also the student who started off with the best ear. That student got about 60 right on the first test and more than 100 right on the second—good enough to be described as having perfect pitch, but then that student had been well on his way before the training. Three other students who had relatively poor scores on the first test got much better on the second, doubling or tripling the number of right answers and making far fewer significant errors. The rest of the twenty-six students improved slightly or stayed the same. But it was clear from the pattern of improvement that the skill of recognizing notes could indeed be trained in adults—at least some adults—and that if the training were continued, or if perhaps a more effective approach were used, a number of those subjects might well have developed perfect pitch. This is a very different picture than the traditional one, which sees perfect pitch as an either/or proposition: either you develop it as a child, or you never will. It may require a great deal of work, and it’s possible that some adults may still never be able to do it, but it now appears that at least some adults can develop perfect pitch.*

*The Scrabble world had never seen anything quite like Nigel Richards. But other fields certainly have. Many of the names are familiar—Beethoven, van Gogh, Newton, Einstein, Darwin, Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods. These are the people whose contributions leave their fields forever changed, the pathfinders who lead the way into new territory so that others can follow. This is the fourth stage of expert performance, where some people move beyond the existing knowledge in their field and make unique creative contributions. It is the least well understood of the four stages and the most intriguing. One thing we do know about these innovators is that they, almost without exception, have worked to become expert performers in their fields before they started breaking new ground. It makes sense that this should be so: After all, how are you going to come up with a valuable new theory in science or a useful new technique on the violin if you are not intimately familiar with—and able to reproduce—the accomplishments of those who preceded you? This is true even in those fields where it might not be so obvious that new inventions are always built upon older ones. Take Pablo Picasso. Someone who only knows his later, more famous paintings could reasonably conclude that they must have sprung directly from a mind untouched by earlier artistic traditions, because they looked so unlike anything from those traditions.*  

- Page 213 (location ~ 3262-3272)    

*Consider this: Those experts who are at the very boundary of their professions—the best mathematicians, the top-ranked grandmasters in the world, the golfers who win major tournaments, the international touring violinists—didn’t achieve their heights just by imitating their teachers. For one thing, most of them at this stage have already surpassed their teachers. The most important lesson they gleaned from their teachers is the ability to improve on their own. As part of their training, their teachers helped them develop mental representations that they could use to monitor their own performances, figure out what needs improving, and come up with ways to realize that improvement. These mental representations, which they are constantly sharpening and augmenting, are what guides them toward greatness.*  

- Page 214 (location ~ 3279-3285)    

*Researchers who study how the creative geniuses in any field—science, art, music, sports, and so on—come up with their innovations have found that it is always a long, slow, iterative process. Sometimes these pathbreakers know what they want to do but don’t know how to do it—like a painter trying to create a particular effect in the eye of the viewer—so they explore various approaches to find one that works. And sometimes they don’t know exactly where they’re going, but they recognize a problem that needs a solution or a situation that needs improving—like mathematicians trying to prove an intractable theorem—and again they try different things, guided by what has worked in the past. There are no big leaps, only developments that look like big leaps to people from the outside because they haven’t seen all of the little steps that comprise them.*  

- Page 215 (location ~ 3288-3294)    

*Creativity will always retain a certain mystery because, by definition, it generates things that have not yet been seen or experienced. But we do know that the sort of focus and effort that give rise to expertise also characterize the work of those pioneers who move beyond where anyone has been before. A psychologist who studied the Scrabble abilities of Nigel Richards called this “the Nigel effect.” The appearance of Richards on the Scrabble scene and his amazing success in tournaments—he has won about 75 percent of all tournament games he has played, an incredibly high number for anyone who plays regularly against the world’s best—showed other Scrabble players what could be achieved in their game. Until Richards came along, no one realized it was possible to be this good, and it forced other Scrabble players to look for ways to increase their own skill levels. No one knows exactly how Richards became so good—he is notoriously uninterested in talking about his training techniques or strategies—but part of it is clearly that he knows more words than any of his competitors.*  

- Page 216 (location ~ 3300-3308)    

*Other Scrabble players are working to catch up, either by memorizing lots of words themselves or with some other approach that neutralizes his advantage. At this writing, Richards is still on top, but over time, his peers will inevitably devise techniques to match and even surpass him—and the field will have moved forward. That’s how it always is. The creative, the restless, and the driven are not content with the status quo, and they look for ways to move forward, to do things that others have not. And once a pathfinder shows how something can be done, others can learn the technique and follow. Even if the pathfinder doesn’t share the particular technique, as is the case with Richards, simply knowing that something is possible drives others to figure it out. Progress is made by those who are working on the frontiers of what is known and what is possible to do, not by those who haven’t put in the effort needed to reach that frontier. In short, in most cases—and this is especially true in any well-developed area—we must rely on the experts to move us forward. Fortunately for all of us, that’s what they do best.*

*WHENEVER I WRITE OR SPEAK about deliberate practice and expertise I am invariably asked, But what about natural talent? In my articles and my talks I always offer the same basic message that I have here: Expert performers develop their extraordinary abilities through years and years of dedicated practice, improving step by step in a long, laborious process. There are no shortcuts. Various sorts of practice can be effective, but the most effective of all is deliberate practice. Deliberate practice takes advantage of the natural adaptability of the human brain and body to create new abilities. Most of these abilities are created with the help of detailed mental representations, which allow us to analyze and respond to situations much more effectively than we could otherwise. Fine, some people will reply, we understand all that. But, even so, aren’t there some people who don’t have to work as hard and can still be better than everyone else? And aren’t there some people who are born without any talent for something—say, music or math or sports—so that no matter how hard they try, they’ll never be any good at it? It is one of the most enduring and deep-seated of all beliefs about human nature—that natural talent plays a major role in determining ability. This belief holds that some people are born with natural endowments that make it easier for them to become outstanding athletes or musicians or chess players or writers or mathematicians or whatever. While they may still need a certain amount of practice to develop their skills, they need far less than others who are not as talented, and they can ultimately reach much greater heights.*

*Paganini’s ability to write and play a beautiful tune on one string of the violin should not be taken lightly. He was a master of the violin, and this was an ability that no other violinist of his time possessed. But the performance was not the magical feat his listeners had believed it to be. It was the product of long, careful practice. One of the major reasons that people believe in the power of innate talent is the apparent existence of natural prodigies—people who, like Paganini, seem to display skills unlike anyone else’s or who exhibit expertise with little or no training. If such natural prodigies do indeed exist, then there must be at least some people who are born with innate abilities that allow them to do things other people cannot. As it happens, I have made it a hobby to investigate the stories of such prodigies, and I can report with confidence that I have never found a convincing case for anyone developing extraordinary abilities without intense, extended practice. My basic approach to understanding prodigies is the same as it is for understanding any expert performer. I ask two simple questions: What is the exact nature of the ability? and, What sorts of training made it possible? In thirty years of looking, I have never found an ability that could not be explained by answering these two questions.*

*We know from the historical record that at a very young age Mozart was impressing audiences across Europe with his playing of the harpsichord, clavichord, and the violin. Beginning when Wolfgang was just six, his father took him and his sister on a multiyear tour across Europe. In Munich, Vienna, Prague, Mannheim, Paris, London, Zurich, and a number of other cities, the three Mozarts—Wolfgang; his father, Leopold; and his sister, Maria Anna—played exhibitions for the elites of the day. And of course little Wolfgang, his legs dangling from the bench and his hands barely able to reach the keyboard, was the main attraction. The Europeans had never seen anything like him. So his abilities at a young age are inarguable. We must then ask, How did he practice? and Can it explain these abilities? Mozart certainly could play the violin and keyboard instruments with a facility that eighteenth-century Europeans were not used to in one so young, but today, when we’re accustomed to seeing five- and six-year-olds trained in the Suzuki method playing beautifully on the violin and piano, his achievements seem much less wondrous. Indeed, there are YouTube videos of four-year-olds playing the violin and the piano with amazing facility—better than most adults. Yet we don’t immediately assume that these children were born with some superior musical talent. We’ve seen enough of these “prodigies” now to know that they have developed their abilities through intense practice beginning at age two or earlier. Mozart, of course, did not have the advantage of the Suzuki method, but he did have a father who was every bit as dedicated to raising a musical prodigy as any modern Suzuki parent.*  

- Page 221 (location ~ 3388-3400)    

*What was Mozart’s talent here, really? What exactly did he do? Once we have answered that question, then we will try to figure out how he did it. First, it’s worth noting that music training today is quite different than what Wolfgang’s father put him through. Today, Suzuki music teachers focus on one aspect of music—performance on a single instrument—while Leopold Mozart not only taught Wolfgang multiple instruments, he also worked with him on listening to and analyzing music and on writing music. So from early on, Leopold was pushing Wolfgang to develop his composing skills. More to the point, though, the claims of Mozart composing at six and eight years old are almost certainly overstated. First, we know that the early compositions Wolfgang supposedly wrote are actually in Leopold’s handwriting. Leopold claimed that he was just cleaning up young Wolfgang’s work, but we have no way of knowing how much of a given composition was Wolfgang’s work and how much was that of Leopold—who, remember, was a composer himself and, furthermore, a frustrated musician and composer who had never gotten all of the acclaim he wanted. There are plenty of parents of elementary school children today who get overly involved in their children’s science-fair projects.*  

- Page 223 (location ~ 3407-3416)    

*It now seems most likely that Leopold had assigned these to Wolfgang as compositional exercises to get him comfortable with the structure of the piano concerto and that there is relatively little in them that is original to Wolfgang. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that even on these reworkings of other people’s compositions, Wolfgang had a great deal of help from his father. The first serious compositions that we can attribute to Wolfgang Mozart with certainty were written when he was fifteen or sixteen—after more than a decade of serious practice under his father’s tutelage.*  

- Page 224 (location ~ 3420-3424)    

*So we have no solid evidence that he did compose any significant music on his own before he was a teenager, and good reason to believe he did not. And when he did unequivocally begin to compose music that was original and sophisticated, he had been training to compose for a decade or so. In short, while there is no doubt that Mozart would become an extraordinary musician and composer, there is no evidence for—and plenty of evidence against—the claim that he was a prodigy whose accomplishments cannot be understood as the result of practice and must therefore be attributed to innate talent. I have found the same thing with every child prodigy I have looked into. A more current example is Mario Lemieux, the Canadian hockey player generally recognized as one of the best of all time. There are various stories—many of them that can be traced back to Lemieux’s mother—of how the young Mario took to the ice like a fish to water, skating from the very beginning as if he had been born to it and showing up older children who had been skating for years. These stories in turn have led some to claim that Lemieux is an example of a person who was clearly born with a superior natural talent. However, a little digging into Lemieux’s childhood reveals a situation very similar to that of the young Wolfgang Mozart. As I mentioned in chapter 7 Mario was the third son in a hockey-mad family, and he grew up with his two older brothers teaching him about hockey and skating almost from the time he could walk. The three would play wooden-spoon hockey together in the basement, sliding around on their stocking feet, and later their father built a rink in their front yard on which they could practice their hockey. So focused were Mario’s parents on encouraging this hockey practice that they would even create stretches of “ice” in their home, where the boys could skate after it got too dark to skate outside. They did this by bringing piles of snow into the house, packing it down on the floors of the front hallway, dining room, and living room, and keeping the door open so that the house would stay cold. The brothers could then skate from room to icy room, giving a whole new meaning to the term home ice. In short, the evidence is that, like Mozart, Lemieux had a lot of practice before people began noticing what a “natural” talent he had.*

*Donald Thomas, originally from the Bahamas, was a student at Lindenwood University in Missouri and a member of the junior varsity basketball team. He was playing basketball with a friend who was a high jumper on the track team, and he showed off with some amazing dunks. Later, in the cafeteria, he and his friend were trading good-natured insults, and his friend said to him something to the effect of, “Sure, you can dunk, but I bet you couldn’t clear six feet six in the high jump.” (That would be a decent jump at the college level—particularly for athletes in the lower-division colleges such as Lindenwood—but the best college-level high jumpers regularly clear seven feet.) So Thomas took him up on the dare. The two went over to the university’s field house, where Thomas’s friend set the high jump bar at six feet six. Thomas, wearing his basketball shorts and shoes, cleared it easily. His friend put it up to six feet eight. Thomas cleared it. Then his friend put the bar all the way up to seven feet. When Thomas cleared that as well, his friend grabbed him and took him to see the school’s track coach, who agreed to have him join the track team and jump in a meet that was coming up in two days. At that meet, still wearing basketball shoes instead of track shoes, Thomas won the competition with a jump of 2.22 meters, or about 7 feet 3.4 inches—which was a record at Eastern Illinois University, where the meet was held.*  

- Page 225 (location ~ 3444-3454)    

*He would later transfer to Auburn University and compete for its track team, and just a year after his gift for high jumping was discovered, he placed first in the World Championships in Athletics in Osaka, Japan, with a jump of 2.35 meters, or nearly 7 feet 8.6 inches. In his book, Epstein dramatized Thomas’s accomplishments by comparing him with Stefan Holm of Sweden, who had been training rigorously on the high jump ever since he was a kid and had logged more than twenty thousand hours of practice. Yet at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics he was beaten by Thomas, who, Epstein estimated, had only a few hundred hours of training. There is clearly a fascination with this type of story, where someone seems to have come out of nowhere to excel as some sort of naturally gifted performer. And these days, because “the ten-thousand-hour rule” has become so well known, the stories are often written as “proof” that this rule is wrong. Donald Thomas or someone else shows us that it is indeed possible to become the best in the world without practicing that much, if only you are born with the right genes. I get it. People want to believe that there is magic in life, that not everything has to abide by the staid, boring rules of the real world. And what could be more magical than being born with some incredible ability that doesn’t require hard work or discipline to develop? There is an entire comic-book industry built on that premise—that sometimes something magical happens, and you suddenly acquire incredible powers. Unbeknownst to you, you were actually born on the planet Krypton and you can fly. Or you were bitten by a radioactive spider and you can cling to walls. Or you were exposed to cosmic radiation and now you can become invisible.*  

- Page 226 (location ~ 3455-3468)    

*Of course, it might be possible that Thomas had no training whatsoever in high school and simply went out one time and jumped six feet four without practice, just like he jumped seven feet without practice in college. The problem with this scenario is that we actually have photos of Thomas clearing the bar in the first college meet, and it is not the technique of someone who has never trained in the high jump. Thomas is clearly using “the Fosbury Flop,” named for the American high jumper Dick Fosbury, who popularized it in the 1960s. The flop is a highly counterintuitive way to get over the bar: you run at the bar in a curving path so that as you reach the point directly in front of the bar, your back is facing it, and then you jump up and arch backward over the bar, throwing your feet up at the last minute so as to not knock the bar down. It is not enough to simply have a lot of spring in your legs; you have to use just the right technique to execute this jump. No one performs the Fosbury Flop effectively without extended practice. So although we don’t know anything explicitly about Thomas’s training before that day in the Lindenwood field house, we can be sure that he spent quite a few hours learning that technique to the point that he could clear “something like 6-2, 6-4.” The second thing we know is that Thomas had an incredible jumping ability when dunking. There are videos of him dunking a basketball after taking off from the free-throw line, fifteen feet from the goal, and flying over a couple of people on his way to the rim. Again, while we have no information on how much practice Thomas put into his dunking, we can be certain he worked hard to develop that spring in his legs. Dunking was clearly something that he was proud of, so it would be strange if he had not worked hard on it.*

*The abilities of these savants, as they are now called, generally arise in very specific areas. Some play a musical instrument and often have thousands of different pieces of music memorized and can sometimes play a new piece of music after hearing it once. Others can paint or sculpt or do other sorts of art, often producing incredibly detailed works. Some do arithmetic calculations, such as multiplying two large numbers in their heads. Still others do calendar calculations, such as stating what day of the week October 12, 2577, will be (a Sunday). What makes these abilities particularly noteworthy is that most of these savants are otherwise mentally challenged in one way or another. Some perform extremely poorly on IQ tests, while others are severely autistic and can barely interact with other people. The appearance of these striking abilities in people who otherwise struggle to function in the world is what makes the savant syndrome so intriguing—and also what makes it seem as if these abilities must have appeared without the normal sort of practice that we generally expect. Again, the best approach to take in understanding these abilities is to first understand exactly what they are and then to look for the sorts of practice that could explain them. Research that has taken that approach indicates that savants are not the recipients of some miraculous talent; instead they have worked for it, just like anyone else.*

*One of the best examples of this is Donny, an autistic savant who is the fastest, most accurate calendar calculator who has ever been tested. Donny can provide the day of the week for a particular date within a second of hearing the date, and he is almost invariably correct. Marc Thioux of the University of Groningen in the Netherlands has been studying Donny for a number of years, and Thioux’s research gives us an unprecedented window into the mind of an autistic savant. Donny is addicted to dates, Thioux has said. The first thing that Donny does when he meets someone is to ask for the person’s birthday. He is constantly thinking about dates and repeating dates to himself. He has memorized all fourteen possible yearly calendars—that is, the seven normal-year calendars in which January 1 is a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, and the corresponding leap-year calendars—and he has developed ways to quickly calculate which of those fourteen possible calendars applies to any given year. When asked which day of the week a particular date will fall on, Donny focuses first on the year in order to figure out which of the fourteen calendars to use, and he then refers to that mental calendar to determine the day of the week for the date in question. In short, Donny possesses a highly developed skill that is the result of years of obsessive study, but no sign of a miraculous innate talent.*

*About one-sixth of all American adults believe they can’t sing. They can’t carry a tune in a bucket. They couldn’t hit a note if you gave them a tennis racket. And, generally speaking, these people aren’t very happy about it. If you talk to music teachers or the few researchers who study nonsingers, they will tell you that these musically challenged sorts would like things to be different. At the very least they’d like to sing “Happy Birthday” without frightening people. They may even daydream about karaoke and bringing the house down with their versions of “My Way” or “Baby One More Time.” But somewhere along the way someone convinced them that they couldn’t sing. Interviews have found that it was usually some sort of authority figure—a parent, an older sibling, a music teacher, maybe a peer they admired—and it usually came at some defining—and often painful—moment that they still remember quite well as adults. Most often they were told they were “tone-deaf.” And so, believing they just weren’t born to sing, they gave up. Now the term tone-deaf actually has a very specific meaning: it means you can’t tell the difference between one musical note and another. For example, if someone hits a C note on the piano and then a D note, a tone-deaf person can’t tell the difference. And, of course, if you can’t tell one note from the next, it would certainly be impossible to carry a tune, which is just a series of notes strung together. It would be like trying to paint a sunset when you can’t tell red from yellow from blue. Some people are indeed born tone-deaf. The medical condition is known as “congenital amusia,” but here is the twist: it is exceedingly rare. It is so rare that the discovery of a woman with this condition rated an article in a major scientific journal. She had no obvious brain damage or defects, had normal hearing and intelligence, and yet she could not tell the difference between a simple melody she had already heard and a new one she had never heard before. Interestingly enough, she also had trouble distinguishing different musical rhythms. This woman, no matter how hard she tried, would never be able to carry a tune. But that is not the case for most people. The major obstacle that people who believe they can’t sing must overcome is that belief itself. Various researchers have studied this issue, and there is no evidence that large numbers of people are born without the innate ability to sing. Indeed, there are some cultures, such as the Anang Ibibio of Nigeria, where everyone is expected to sing, everyone is taught to sing, and everyone can sing. In our culture, the reason that most nonsingers cannot sing is simply that they never practiced in a way that led them to develop the ability to sing. Could the same thing be true about a subject like math? There is perhaps no area in which more people will tell you, “I am no good in . . .” A large percentage of students, particularly in the United States, leave high school with the conviction that they just do not have the genetic endowment to do any math more complicated than addition, subtraction, and perhaps multiplication. But a number of successful efforts have shown that pretty much any child can learn math if it is taught in the right way.*  

- Page 233 (location ~ 3562-3586)    

*In all of these cases, when you looked around you would have noticed that some of your friends or classmates or peers were doing better than others, and some were doing worse. There are always obvious differences in how quickly different people pick something up. Some just seem to have an easier time playing a musical instrument. Some just seem to be natural athletes. Some just seem to be naturally good with numbers. And so on. And because we see such differences in beginners, it’s natural to assume that those differences will persist—that the same people who did so well in the beginning will continue to breeze through later on. These lucky people, we imagine, were born with innate talents that smooth the way and lead them to excel. This is an understandable result of observing the beginning of the journey and concluding that the rest of the journey will be similar. It is also wrong. Once we take a look at the entire journey—from beginner to expert—we develop a very different understanding of how people learn and improve and what it takes to excel. Perhaps the best example we have of this comes from chess. In the popular imagination, great skill in chess is intimately tied to tremendous logic and intellect. If an author or screenwriter wishes to signal that a character is particularly brilliant, that character will be seated at a chessboard and will checkmate his or her opponent with the proper savoir faire.*  

- Page 235 (location ~ 3603-3613)    

*Even stranger is the case of Go, which has often been referred to as the Asian version of chess. It is played by two people who alternately place their stones—white for one player, black for the other—on one of the intersecting points on the 19 x 19 grid that makes up the board. The goal is to surround and capture the other player’s stones, and the winner is the one who controls the larger area of the board at the end of the game. While there is only one type of piece and only one type of move—putting a stone on an intersection point—the game is actually more complex than chess, in the sense that there are far more different possible games that can be played, and, indeed, it has proved far more challenging than chess to develop software to play the game well. Unlike the best chess-playing computer programs, which can consistently beat chess grandmasters, the best Go programs—at least as this is written in 2015—cannot stand up to top-ranked Go players. Thus, as with chess, you might assume that Go masters must have high IQs or perhaps exceptional visuospatial skills, but again you would be wrong. Recent studies of Go masters have found that their average IQ is, if anything, below average. Two separate studies of Korean Go experts found an average IQ of about 93, compared with control groups of non-Go-playing Koreans matched for age and sex, which had an average IQ around 100. While the numbers of Go masters in the two studies were small enough that the below-average IQs could have been just statistical flukes, it is clear that Go masters, on average, score no higher on IQ tests than people in the general population. Against this background the three British researchers set out to resolve the conflicting results on chess players. Does a higher intelligence (that is, a higher IQ score) help one develop a better chess game or not? The researchers’ plan was to do a study that took into account both intelligence and practice time. Earlier studies had looked at one or the other but not both together.*  

- Page 239 (location ~ 3650-3664)    

*When the researchers analyzed all their data, they found results similar to those seen by other researchers. The amount of chess practice that the children had done was the biggest factor in explaining how well they played chess, with more practice being correlated with better scores on the various measures of chess skill. A smaller but still significant factor was intelligence, with higher IQ being related to better chess skills. Surprisingly, visuospatial intelligence wasn’t the most important factor, but rather memory and processing speed were. Looking at all their evidence, the researchers concluded that in children of this age, practice is the key factor in success, although innate intelligence (or IQ) still plays a role. The picture changed dramatically, however, when the researchers looked at only the “elite” players in the group. These were twenty-three children—all boys—who were regularly playing in tournaments on the local, national, and sometimes international levels. They had an average chess rating of 1603, with the highest being 1835 and the lowest 1390. In short, these kids were already quite good at chess. The average chess rating for everyone who plays in chess tournaments, both adults and children, is about 1500, which means that most of the boys in the elite group were above that average, and even the worst of them would have had little trouble checkmating a competent adult player. Among these twenty-three elite players the amount of practice was still the major factor determining their chess skills, but intelligence played no noticeable role.*  

- Page 240 (location ~ 3674-3685)    

*Kids with higher IQ scores generally find it easier to learn and remember rules and to develop and carry out strategies; all of these things give them an advantage in the early stages of learning the game, when one plays by abstract thinking applied directly to the pieces on the board. This type of learning is not all that different from the learning that goes on in schools, which was the target of Binet’s original project developing IQ tests. But we know that as children (or adults) study and learn the game, they develop sets of mental representations—in essence, mental shortcuts—that give them both a superior memory for the sorts of chess positions found in a game and an ability to quickly zero in on appropriate moves in a given situation. It seems quite likely that these superior mental representations allow them to play the game more quickly and powerfully. Now when they see a certain arrangement of pieces, they don’t have to carefully figure out which piece is attacking or could attack every other piece; instead they recognize a pattern and know almost reflexively what the most powerful moves and countermoves would likely be.*  

- Page 241 (location ~ 3694-3702)    

*While people with certain innate characteristics—IQ, in the case of the chess study—may have an advantage when first learning a skill, that advantage gets smaller over time, and eventually the amount and the quality of practice take on a much larger role in determining how skilled a person becomes. Researchers have seen evidence of this pattern in many different fields. In music, as in chess, there is an early correlation between IQ and performance. For example, a study of ninety-one fifth-grade students who were given piano instruction for six months found that, on average, the students with higher IQs performed better at the end of those six months than those with lower IQs. However, the measured correlation between IQ and music performance gets smaller as the years of music study increase, and tests have found no relationship between IQ and music performance among music majors in college or among professional musicians. In a study on expertise in oral surgery, the performance of dental students was found to be related to their performance on tests of visuospatial ability, and the students who scored higher on those tests also performed better on surgical simulations done on the model of a jaw. However, when the same test was done on dental residents and dental surgeons, no such correlation was found. Thus the initial influence of visuospatial ability on surgical performance disappears over time as the dental students practice their skills, and by the time they have become residents, the differences in “talent”—in this case, visuospatial ability—no longer have a noticeable effect.*  

- Page 243 (location ~ 3723-3735)    

*A number of researchers have suggested that there are, in general, minimum requirements for performing capably in various areas. For instance, it has been suggested that scientists in at least some fields need an IQ score of around 110 to 120 to be successful, but that a higher score doesn’t confer any additional benefit. However, it is not clear whether that IQ score of 110 is necessary to actually perform the duties of a scientist or simply to get to the point where you can be hired as a scientist. In many scientific fields you need to hold a Ph.D. to be able to get research grants and conduct research, and getting a Ph.D. requires four to six years of successful postgraduate academic performance with a high level of writing skills and a large vocabulary—which are essentially attributes measured by verbal intelligence tests. Furthermore, most science Ph.D. programs demand mathematical and logical thinking, which are measured by other components of intelligence tests. When college graduates apply to graduate school they have to take such tests as the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), which measure these abilities, and only the high-scoring students are accepted into science graduate programs. Thus, from this perspective, it is not surprising that scientists generally have IQ scores of 110 to 120 or above: without the ability to achieve such scores, it is unlikely they would have ever had the chance to become scientists in the first place. One could also speculate that there are certain minimum “talent” requirements for such things as playing sports or painting, so that people who fall below those requirements would find it difficult or impossible to become highly skilled in those areas. But, outside of some very basic physical traits, such as height and body size in sports, we have no solid evidence that such minimum requirements exist.*  

- Page 245 (location ~ 3745-3758)    

*The bottom line is that no one has ever managed to figure out how to identify people with “innate talent.” No one has ever found a gene variant that predicts superior performance in one area or another, and no one has ever come up with a way to, say, test young children and identify which among them will become the best athletes or the best mathematicians or the best doctors or the best musicians. There is a simple reason for this. If there are indeed genetic differences that play a role in influencing how well someone performs (beyond the initial stages when someone is just learning a skill), they aren’t likely to be something that affects the relevant skills directly—a “music gene” or a “chess gene” or a “math gene.” No, I suspect that such genetic differences—if they exist—are most likely to manifest themselves through the necessary practice and efforts that go into developing a skill. Perhaps, for example, some children are born with a suite of genes that cause them to get more pleasure from drawing or from making music. Then those children will be more likely to draw or to make music than other children. If they’re put in art classes or music classes, they’re likely to spend more time practicing because it is more fun for them. They carry their sketchpads or guitars with them wherever they go. And over time these children will become better artists or better musicians than their peers—not because they are innately more talented in the sense that they have some genes for musical or artistic ability, but because something—perhaps genetic—pushed them to practice and thus develop their skills to a greater degree than their peers.*  

- Page 247 (location ~ 3773-3784)    

*It is possible to imagine a number of genetically based differences of this sort. Some people might, for instance, be naturally able to focus more intently and for longer periods of time than others; since deliberate practice depends on being able to focus in this way, these people might be naturally able to practice more effectively than others and thus benefit more from their practice. One could even imagine differences in how the brain responds to challenges so that practice would be more effective in some people than in others in building new brain structures and mental capacity. Much of this remains speculative at this point. But since we know that practice is the single most important factor in determining a person’s ultimate achievement in a given domain, it makes sense that if genes do play a role, their role would play out through shaping how likely a person is to engage in deliberate practice or how effective that practice is likely to be. Seeing it in this way puts genetic differences in a completely different light.*

*Malcolm Gladwell told a story in his book Outliers—a story that others had told before him, but it was Gladwell’s telling that got the most attention—of how there are many more Canadian professional hockey players born in the months of January through March than born in October through December. Is there something magical about being born in these months that grants extra talent for hockey to babies lucky enough to be born then? No. What happens is that there is a cutoff for playing youth hockey in Canada—you must be a certain age by December 31 of the previous year—and the children born in the first three months of the year are the oldest players in each class of players. When children start playing hockey at around age four or five, the advantage that older kids can have over younger ones is striking. Kids with an age advantage of close to a year will generally be taller, heavier, and somewhat more coordinated and mentally mature, and they may have had one more hockey season to develop their hockey skills, so they are likely to be better at hockey than the younger players in their age group. But those age-related physical differences get smaller and smaller as the hockey players get older, and they have pretty much disappeared by the time the players reach adulthood. So the age-related advantage must have its roots in childhood, when the physical differences still exist.*  

- Page 249 (location ~ 3816-3825)    

*Coaches can’t really tell how old the various child hockey players are; all they can see is who is doing better and thus, by inference, who appears to be more talented. Many coaches will tend to treat the more “talented” players with more praise and better instruction and to give these players more opportunities to play in games. And these players will be viewed as more talented not just by the coach but also by the other players. Furthermore, these players might be more willing to practice more because they are told that they have the promise of playing at very high levels, even professionally. The results of all this are striking—and not just in hockey. For example, one study found that among thirteen-year-old soccer players, more than 90 percent of the ones who were nominated as the best had been born in the first six months of the year. The advantage among hockey players does seem to taper off somewhat once the players make it into the major leagues—perhaps because the younger ones who have managed to hang around have learned to work harder at their practicing and thus end up outshining many of the ones who are six months older—but there is no doubt that being born in January through March is an advantage to any Canadian boy who wants to play hockey.*  

- Page 250 (location ~ 3826-3835)    

*Most teachers, however, are not familiar with this possibility, so when some kids “get” math more quickly than others, they’re generally assumed to be gifted at math while the others aren’t. Then the “gifted” ones get more encouragement, more training, and so on, and, sure enough, after a year or so they’re much better at math than the others, and this advantage propagates through the school years. Since there are a number of careers, like engineering or physics, that require math courses in college, the students who have been judged to have no talent for math find these careers closed to them. But if math works the same way as chess, then we have lost a whole collection of children who might eventually have become quite accomplished in these areas if only they hadn’t been labeled as “no good at math” in the very beginning. This is the dark side of believing in innate talent. It can beget a tendency to assume that some people have a talent for something and others don’t and that you can tell the difference early on. If you believe that, you encourage and support the “talented” ones and discourage the rest, creating the self-fulfilling prophecy. It is human nature to want to put effort—time, money, teaching, encouragement, support—where it will do the most good and also to try to protect kids from disappointment. There is usually nothing nefarious going on here, but the results can be incredibly damaging. The best way to avoid this is to recognize the potential in all of us—and work to find ways to develop*

*In the deliberate-practice class the goal was not to feed information to the students but rather to get them to practice thinking like physicists. To do that, Deslauriers would first have the students divide up into small groups and then pose a “clicker question,” that is, a question that the students answered electronically, with the answers sent automatically to the instructor. The questions were chosen to get the students in the class thinking about concepts that typically give first-year physics students difficulty. The students would talk about each question within their small groups, send in their answers, and then Deslauriers would display the results and talk about them, answering any questions that the students might have. The discussions got the students thinking about the concepts, drawing connections, and often moving beyond the specific clicker question they’d been asked. Several clicker questions were asked during the course of the class, and sometimes Deslauriers might have the student groups discuss a question a second time, after he had offered some thoughts for them to ponder. Sometimes he would offer a mini-lecture if it seemed that the students were having difficulty with a particular idea. Each class also included an “active learning task” in which the students in each group considered a question and then individually wrote their answers and submitted them, after which Deslauriers would again answer questions and address misconceptions. During the class Schelew would walk around among the groups, answering questions, listening to the discussions, and identifying problem areas.*  

- Page 254 (location ~ 3892-3903)    

*At the end of week twelve, the students in both class sections were given a multiple-choice clicker test to see how well they had learned the material. Deslauriers and the instructor in the traditional class had worked together to develop a test that they and the instructor of a third section all agreed was a good measure of the learning objectives for that week. The test questions were very standard. Indeed, most of them were clicker questions that had been used for a physics class at another university, sometimes with small modifications. The average score of the students in the traditional section was 41 percent; the average in Deslauriers’s class was 74 percent. That is obviously a big difference, but given that random guessing would have produced a score of 23 percent, when you do the math it turns out that the students in the traditional class, on average, knew the right answer on only about 24 percent of the questions, compared with an average of about 66 percent in the class designed to apply the principles of deliberate practice. That is a huge difference. The students in the deliberate practice class got more than 2.5 times as many right answers as those in the other class.*  

- Page 256 (location ~ 3912-3920)    

*Wieman and his colleagues expressed the difference in another way, using a statistical term known as “the effect size.” In these terms the difference between the performances of the two classes was 2.5 standard deviations. For the sake of comparison, other new teaching methods in science and engineering classrooms generally have effect sizes less than 1.0, and the largest effect size observed for an educational intervention before this had been 2.0—which was accomplished with the use of trained personal tutors. Wieman got to 2.5 with a graduate student and a postdoc who had never taught a class before.*

*For instance, it has always been surprising to me when I talk to full-time athletes and their coaches how many of them have never taken the time to identify those aspects of performance that they would like to improve and then design training methods aimed specifically at those things. In reality, much of the training that athletes do—especially athletes in team sports—is carried out in groups with no attempt to figure out what each individual should be focusing on. Furthermore, very little has been done to learn about the mental representations that successful athletes use. The ideal approach to fixing this would be to have athletes verbally report their thinking while they are performing, which would make it possible for researchers, coaches, or perhaps even the athletes themselves to design training tasks to improve their representations of game situations, in the same way that we described in chapter 3. There are, of course, some elite athletes who develop effective representations by themselves, but most of these top players are not even aware of how their thinking differs from those less accomplished. And the converse is certainly often true as well—that the less accomplished athletes don’t understand*

*Given how little work has been done to apply the principles of deliberate practice to the development of expert performers, particularly athletes, it is clear there is great potential for improvement by focusing on individualized training and the assessment of the athletes’ mental representations. And I will continue to work with coaches, trainers, and athletes to help them use deliberate practice more effectively. But the greatest potential benefits from deliberate practice, I believe, lie elsewhere. After all, the top performers in the various highly specialized and highly competitive fields—the professional athletes, the world-class musicians, the chess grandmasters, and so on—make up just a tiny fraction of the world’s population, and while it is a very visible and entertaining fraction, it will make a relatively small difference to the rest of the world if these few people get marginally better at what they do. There are other areas where many more people can be helped and where the improvements can be much larger because the training in those areas is even further away from what deliberate practice tells us is the ideal. Education is one of those areas. Education touches everyone, and there are a number of ways that deliberate practice could revolutionize how people learn. The first is pedagogical. How do students learn best? Deliberate practice has a great deal to say about that question. Let’s take a closer look at that UBC physics class to see how the principles of deliberate practice can be applied to help students learn faster and better than they do with traditional approaches. The first thing that Wieman and his colleagues did in designing the class was to speak with the traditional instructors to determine exactly what the students should be able to do once they finished the section. As we discussed in chapter 5, a major difference between the deliberate-practice approach and the traditional approach to learning lies with the emphasis placed on skills versus knowledge—what you can do versus what you know. Deliberate practice is all about the skills. You pick up the necessary knowledge in order to develop the skills; knowledge should never be an end in itself. Nonetheless, deliberate practice results in students picking up quite a lot of knowledge along the way. If you teach a student facts, concepts, and rules, those things go into long-term memory as individual pieces, and if a student then wishes to do something with them—use them to solve a problem, reason with them to answer a question, or organize and analyze them to come up with a theme or a hypothesis—the limitations of attention and short-term memory kick in. The student must keep*

*Once Wieman and his colleagues had put together a list of what things their students should be able to do, they transformed it into a collection of specific learning objectives. Again, this is a classic deliberate-practice approach: when teaching a skill, break the lesson into a series of steps that the student can master one at a time, building from one to the next to reach the ultimate objective. While this sounds very similar to the scaffolding approach used in traditional education, it differs crucially in its focus on understanding the necessary mental representations at each step of the way and making sure that the student has developed the appropriate representations before moving to the next step. This seems to have been, for example, the crucial ingredient in the success of the Jump Math program described in the last chapter: the program carefully delineates which representations are necessary for the development of a particular math skill and then teaches in a way that builds those representations in the students.*

*Research comparing physics experts with physics students has found that while the students may sometimes be almost as good as the experts at solving quantitative problems—that is, problems involving numbers that can be solved by applying the right equation—the students are far behind the experts in their ability to solve qualitative problems, or problems that involve concepts but no numbers, something like, Why is it hot in summer and cold in the winter? Answering a question like that requires less a command of numbers than it does a clear understanding of the concepts that underlie particular events or processes—that is, good mental representations.*

*An amusing video taken at a Harvard University commencement shows a string of recent graduates confidently explaining that the seasons result from the Earth being closer to the sun in summer and farther away in winter. This is completely wrong, of course, since when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere. The real cause of the seasons is the tilt of the Earth on its axis. But the point here is not the ignorance of Harvard graduates but rather that so little of science education gives students the basic mental representations they need to think clearly about physical phenomena rather than teaching them simply to plug numbers into an equation.*

*The redesigned physics class at the University of British Columbia offers a road map for redesigning instruction according to deliberate-practice principles: Begin by identifying what students should learn how to do. The objectives should be skills, not knowledge. In figuring out the particular way students should learn a skill, examine how the experts do it. In particular, understand as much as possible about the mental representations that experts use, and teach the skill so as to help students develop similar mental representations. This will involve teaching the skill step by step, with each step designed to keep students out of their comfort zone but not so far out that they cannot master that step. Then give plenty of repetition and feedback; the regular cycle of try, fail, get feedback, try again, and so on is how the students will build their mental representations.*

*Redesigning teaching methods using deliberate practice could dramatically increase how quickly and how well students learn—as the almost unbelievable improvements in Wieman’s students indicates—but it will require not only a change in mindset among educators but much more research into the minds of experts. We’re only just starting to understand the types of mental representations that experts use and how to develop these representations with deliberate practice. There is much more to do. In addition to more effective teaching methods, there are other, less obvious ways that deliberate practice can be applied to education. In particular I think there would be tremendous value in helping children and, especially, adolescents develop detailed mental representations in at least one area, for reasons that we will discuss below. This is not a goal of the current educational system, and generally the only students who do develop such representations are those who are pursuing some skill outside of school—playing a sport or a musical instrument, for instance—and even then the students do not really understand what they’re doing or recognize that their representations are part of a larger phenomenon that stretches across fields.*

*Having students create mental representations in one area helps them understand exactly what it takes to be successful not only in that area but in others as well. Most people, even adults, have never attained a level of performance in any field that is sufficient to show them the true power of mental representations to plan, execute, and evaluate their performance in the way that expert performers do. And thus they never really understand what it takes to reach this level—not just the time it takes, but the high-quality practice. Once they do understand what is necessary to get there in one area, they understand, at least in principle, what it takes in other areas. That is why experts in one field can often appreciate those in other fields. A research physicist may better understand what it takes to become a skilled violinist, if only in general terms, and a ballerina may better understand the sacrifice it takes to become a skilled painter. Our schools should give all students such an experience in some domain. Only then will they understand what is possible and also what it takes to make it happen.*

*In the introduction to this book I spoke of how deliberate practice can revolutionize our thinking about human potential. I do not see this as an exaggeration or overstatement. That revolution starts when we realize that the best among us in various areas do not occupy that perch because they were born with some innate talent but rather because they have developed their abilities through years of practice, taking advantage of the adaptability of the human body and brain. But that realization is not enough. We need to give people the tools they need to harness that adaptability and take control of their own potential. Spreading the word about deliberate practice—as I am doing with this book—is part of that, but many of the necessary tools are still undeveloped. In most fields we still don’t know exactly what distinguishes experts from everyone else. Nor do we have many details about the experts’ mental representations. We need to map out the various factors that make up an expert over his or her entire lifespan in order to provide direction for other people who want to develop expertise.*

*Even those who don’t reach the frontiers of a field can still enjoy the challenge of taking control of their own lives and improving their abilities. A world in which deliberate practice is a normal part of life would be one in which people had more volition and satisfaction. And I would argue that we humans are most human when we’re improving ourselves. We, unlike any other animal, can consciously change ourselves, to improve ourselves in ways we choose. This distinguishes us from every other species alive today and, as far as we know, from every other species that has ever lived. The classic conception of human nature is captured in the name we gave ourselves as a species, Homo sapiens. Our distant ancestors included Homo erectus, or “upright man,” because the species could walk upright, and Homo habilis, the “handy man,” so named because the species was at one time thought to be the earliest humans to have made and used stone tools. We call ourselves “knowing man” because we see ourselves as distinguished from our ancestors by our vast amount of knowledge. But perhaps a better way to see ourselves would be as Homo exercens, or “practicing man,” the species that takes control of its life through practice and makes of itself what it will.*

*Thanks to technology our world is changing at an ever-increasing pace. Two hundred years ago a person could learn a craft or trade and be fairly certain that that education would suffice for a lifetime. People born in my generation grew up thinking the same way: get an education, get a job, and you’ll be set until you retire. That has changed in my lifetime. Many jobs that existed forty years ago have disappeared or else have changed so much as to be almost unrecognizable. And people coming into the work force today should expect to change careers two or three times during their working lives. As for the children being born today, no one knows, but I think it’s safe to say that the changes won’t be slowing down. How do we as a society prepare for that? In the future most people will have no choice but to continuously learn new skills, so it will be essential to train students and adults about how to learn efficiently. With the technological revolution there are new opportunities to make teaching more effective. It is possible, for example, to videotape real-world experiences of doctors, athletes, and teachers and create libraries and learning centers where students could be trained in such a way that avoids having to learn on the job and risk the welfare of patients, students, and clients.*
