# Web apps for fun  

The world is quickly turning a lot of what is said into quantifiable and recorded information.  To the [last post about APIs](/collection/apis-i), this data becomes available in services like the APIs mentioned before.  This quickly makes the information accessible to anyone who can connect with the service via HTTP, GraphQL or other connection services.  These API services can be used for useful and mostly useless data sets that one can find on resources such as this [repository on Github](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) with resources for animals, events, chuck norris and photography.  As I am a bit of a fun of [Kanye West](photos/yeezus), I decided it was only appropriate to channel his wisdom into a fun application which was found on the list at [Kanye.rest](https://kanye.rest).   


# Ye's Wisdom   

As others have collected the information and made the API service available, I thought it might be fun to connect a mobile front-end to this service using Shiny.  Here's what it looks like:

Coding should be fun and developing this one was a lot of fun in a short amount of time.  With a quick few hours using a framework7 package, I turned this application into a Progressive Web Application you can down to your phone and computer. If you want to download it yourself, go to [this link](https://eval.shinyapps.io/__ye/) and [save to iOS as a bookmark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqlLCn7_fWk) or [to your Android homescreen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGgu0LTVyY0).  

# Curious about the code?  

Check out my github where I have the [code posted for deploying and developing the application locally](https://github.com/Esturban/ye). Create issues, forks or pull requests letting me know what you think or how you might want to improve it!
