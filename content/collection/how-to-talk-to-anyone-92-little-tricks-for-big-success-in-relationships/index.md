*How to Talk to Anyone “Easy,” Bob interrupted. He knew precisely what I was get- ting at. “Just give ’em great posture, a heads-up look, a confident smile, and a direct gaze.” It’s the ideal image for somebody who’s a Somebody.*

*“He then brought out a yellowed newspaper article quoting a study he’d been saving to show me when the time was right. It con- cerned women in business. The study showed women who were slower to smile in corporate life were perceived as more credible.” As Missy talked, I began to think about history-making women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Madeleine Albright, and other powerful women of their ilk. Not one was known for her quick smile. Missy continued, “The study went on to say a big, warm smile is an asset. But only when it comes a little slower, because then it has more credibility.” From that moment on, Missy explained, she gave clients and business associates her big smile. However, she trained her lips to erupt more slowly. Thus her smile appeared more sincere and personalized for the recipient.*

*I decided to do more research on the smile. When you’re in the market for shoes, you begin to look at everyone’s feet. When you decide to change your hairstyle, you look at everyone’s hair- cut. Well, for several months, I became a steady smile watcher. I watched smiles on the street. I watched smiles on TV. I watched the smiles of politicians, the clergy, corporate giants, and world leaders. My findings? Amid the sea of flashing teeth and parting lips, I discovered the people perceived to have the most credibil- ity and integrity were just ever so slower to smile. Then, when they did, their smiles seemed to seep into every crevice of their faces and envelop them like a slow flood. Thus I call the following tech- nique “The Flooding Smile.”*

*The Flooding Smile Don’t flash an immediate smile when you greet someone, as though anyone who walked into your line of sight would be the beneficiary. Instead, look at the other person’s face for a second. Pause. Soak in their persona. Then let a big, warm, responsive smile flood over your face and overflow into your eyes. It will engulf the recipient like a warm wave. The split-second delay convinces people your flooding smile is genuine and only for them. Let us now travel but a few inches north to two of the most powerful communications tools you possess, your eyes.*

*Your eyes are personal grenades that have the power to detonate people’s emotions. Just as martial arts masters register their fists as lethal weapons, you can register your eyes as psychological lethal weapons when you master the following eye-contact techniques. Beloved people in the game of life look beyond the conven- tional wisdom that teaches “Keep good eye contact.” For one, they understand that to certain suspicious or insecure people, intense eye contact can be a virulent intrusion.*

*A Boston center conducted a study to learn the precise effect.5 The researchers asked opposite-sex individuals to have a two- minute casual conversation. They tricked half their subjects into maintaining intense eye contact by directing them to count the number of times their partner blinked. They gave the other half of the subjects no special eye-contact directions for the chat. When they questioned the subjects afterward, the unsuspect- ing blinkers reported significantly higher feelings of respect and fondness for their colleagues who, unbeknownst to them, had sim- ply been counting their blinks. I’ve experienced the closeness intense eye contact engenders with a stranger firsthand. Once, when giving a seminar to several hundred people, one woman’s face in the crowd caught my atten- tion. The participant’s appearance was not particularly unique. Yet she became the focus of my attention throughout my talk. Why? Because not for one moment did she take her eyes off my face. Even when I finished making a point and was silent, her eyes stayed hungrily on my face. I sensed she couldn’t wait to savor the next insight to spout from my lips. I loved it! Her concentration and obvious fascination inspired me to remember stories and make important points I’d long forgotten.*

*There is yet another argument for intense eye contact. In addition to awakening feelings of respect and affection, maintaining strong eye contact gives you the impression of being an intelligent and abstract thinker. Because abstract thinkers integrate incoming data more easily than concrete thinkers, they can continue looking into someone’s eyes even during the silences. Their thought processes are not distracted by peering into their partner’s peepers.6 Back to our valiant psychologists. Yale researchers, thinking they had the unswerving truth about eye contact, conducted another study that, they assumed, would confirm “the more eye contact, the more positive feelings.” This time, they directed sub- jects to deliver a personally revealing monologue. They asked the listeners to react with a sliding scale of eye contact while their part- ners talked. The results? All went as expected when women told their per- sonal stories to women. Increased eye contact encouraged feelings 01 (001-042B) part one 8/14/03 9:16 AM Page 12 12 How to Talk to Anyone of intimacy.*

*Your partner’s emotional reaction to your profound gaze has a biological base. When you look intently at someone, it increases their heartbeat and shoots an adrenalinelike substance gushing through their veins.7 This is the same physical reaction people have when they start to fall in love. And when you consciously increase your eye contact, even during normal business or social interac- tion, people will feel they have captivated you.*

*Technique #2 Sticky Eyes Pretend your eyes are glued to your conversation partner’s with sticky warm taffy. Don’t break eye contact even after he or she has finished speaking. When you must look away, do it ever so slowly, reluctantly, stretching the gooey taffy until the tiny string finally breaks. What About Guys’ Eyes? Now gentlemen: when talking to men, you, too, can use Sticky Eyes. Just make them a little less sticky when discussing personal matters with other men, lest your listener feel threatened or mis- interpret your intentions. But do increase your eye contact slightly 01 (001-042B) part one 8/14/03 9:16 AM Page 13 How to Strike Everyone as Intelligent and Insightful by Using Your Eyes 13 more than normal with men on day-to-day communications— and a lot more when talking to women. It broadcasts a visceral message of comprehension and respect.*

*The Epoxy Eyes technique takes at least three people to pull off—you, your target, and one other person. Here’s how it works. Usually, when you’re chatting with two or more people, you gaze at the person who is speaking. However, the Epoxy Eyes technique suggests you concentrate on the listener—your target—rather than the speaker. This slightly disorients the target and he or she silently asks, “Why is this person looking at me instead of the speaker?” Your target senses you are extremely interested in his or her reac- tions. This can be beneficial in certain business situations when it is appropriate that you judge the listener. Human resources professionals often use Epoxy Eyes, not as a technique, but because they are sincerely interested in a pro- spective employee’s reaction to certain ideas being presented.*  

- Page 32 (location ~ 489-497)    

*When you use Epoxy Eyes, it sends out signals of interest blended with complete confidence in yourself. But because Epoxy Eyes puts you in a position of evaluating or judging someone else, you must be careful. Don’t overdo it or you could come across as arrogant and brazen. Technique #3 Epoxy Eyes This brazen technique packs a powerful punch. Watch your target person even when someone else is talking. No matter who is speaking, keep looking at the man or woman you want to impact. Sometimes using full Epoxy Eyes is too potent, so here is a gentler, yet effective, form. Watch the speaker but let your glance bounce to your target each time the speaker finishes a point. This way Mr. or Ms. Target still feels you are intrigued by his or her reactions, yet there is relief from the intensity. Use Epoxy Eyes to Push Their Erotic Button If romance is on the horizon, Epoxy Eyes transmits yet another message. It says, “I can’t take my eyes off you” or “I only have eyes for you.” Anthropologists have dubbed eyes “the initial organ of romance” because studies show intense eye contact plays havoc with our heartbeat.8*

*Men, Epoxy Eyes is extremely effective on women—if they find you attractive. The lady interprets her nervous reaction to your untoward gaze as budding infatuation. If she does not like you, however, your Epoxy Eyes is downright obnoxious. (Never use Epoxy Eyes on strangers in public settings or you could get arrested!)*

*Your body has another instinctive reaction. When a big jolt of hap- piness hits your heart and you feel like a winner, your head jerks up automatically and you throw your shoulders back. A smile frames your lips and softens your eyes. This is the look winners have constantly. They stand with assurance. They move with confidence. They smile softly with pride. No doubt about it—good posture symbolizes that you are a man or woman who is used to being on top.*

*Before walking through any door—the door to your office, a party, a meeting, even your kitchen—picture a leather bit hang- ing by a cable from the frame. It is swinging just an inch higher than your head. As you pass through the door, throw your head back and chomp on the imaginary dental grip that first pulls your cheeks back into a smile and then lifts you up. As you ascend high above the gasping crowd, your body is stretched into perfect align- ment—head high, shoulders back, torso out of hips, feet weight- less. At the zenith of the tent, you spin like a graceful top to the amazement and admiration of the crowd craning their necks to watch you. Now you look like a Somebody. One day, to test Hang by Your Teeth, I decided to count how many times I walked through a doorway: sixty times, even at home. You calculate: twice out your front door, twice in, six times to the bathroom, eight times to the kitchen, and through count- less doors at your office. It adds up. Visualize anything sixty times a day and it becomes a habit! Habitual good posture is the first mark of a big winner. You are now ready to float into the room to captivate the crowd or close the sale (or maybe just settle for looking like the most important Somebody in the room). You now have all the basics Bob the artist needs to portray you as a big winner. Like he said, “great posture, a heads-up look, a confident smile, and a direct gaze.” The ideal image for some- body who’s a Somebody.*

*Technique #4 Hang by Your Teeth Visualize a circus iron-jaw bit hanging from the frame of every door you walk through. Take a bite and, with it firmly between your teeth, let it swoop you to the peak of the big top. When you hang by your teeth, every muscle is stretched into perfect posture position. Now let’s put the whole act into motion. It’s time to turn your attention outward to your conversation partner. Use the next two techniques to make him or her feel like a million.*

*An interesting aside: trial lawyers often choose women to do this twitch-and-turn spying job because, traditionally, females are sharper observers of subtle body cues than males. Women, more sensitive to emotions than men, often ask their husbands, “Is something bothering you, Honey?” (These supersensitive women accuse their husbands of being so insensitive to emotions that they wouldn’t notice anything is wrong until their neckties are drenched in her tears.) The attorney and the assistant then review your “score” on the dozens of subconscious signals you flashed. Depending on their tally, you could find yourself on jury duty or twiddling your thumbs back in the juror’s waiting room. Trial lawyers are so conscious of body language that, in the 1960s during the famous trial of the Chicago Seven, defense attor- ney William Kuntsler actually made a legal objection to Judge Julius Hoffman’s posture. During the summation by the prosecu- tion, Judge Hoffman leaned forward, which, accused Kuntsler, sent a message to the jury of attention and interest. During his defense summation, complained Kuntsler, Judge Hoffman leaned back, sending the jury a subliminal message of disinterest.*

*The Big-Baby Pivot Give everyone you meet The Big-Baby Pivot. The instant the two of you are introduced, reward your new acquaintance. Give the warm smile, the total-body turn, and the undivided attention you would give a tiny tyke who crawled up to your feet, turned a precious face up to yours, and beamed a big toothless grin. Pivoting 100 percent toward the new person shouts “I think you are very, very special.”*  

- Page 44 (location ~ 673-678)    

*How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once A very wise man with the funny name of Zig9 once told me, “Peo- ple don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care . . . about them.” Zig Ziglar is right. The secret to mak- ing people like you is showing how much you like them! Your body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station reveal- ing to anyone within eyeshot precisely how you feel at any given moment. Even if your Hang by Your Teeth posture is gaining their respect, your Flooding Smile and The Big-Baby Pivot are making them feel special, and your Sticky Eyes are capturing their hearts and minds, the rest of your body can reveal any incongruence. Every inch—from the crinkle of your forehead to the position of your feet—must give a command performance if you want to effectively present an “I care about you” attitude.*

*How to Trick Your Body into Doing Everything Right Here’s a visualization technique that accomplishes all that. It guar- antees that everyone you encounter will feel your warmth. I call it “Hello Old Friend.” When meeting someone, play a mental trick on yourself. In your mind’s eye, see him or her as an old friend, someone you had a wonderful relationship with years ago. But somehow you lost track of your friend. You tried so hard to find your good buddy, but there was no listing in the phone book. No information online. None of your mutual friends had a clue. Suddenly, WOW! What a surprise! After all those years, the two of you are reunited. You are so happy. That’s where the pretending stops. Obviously, you are not going to try to convince the new person that the two of you are really old friends. You are not going to hug and kiss and say, “Great to see you again!” or “How have you been all these years?” You 01 (001-042B) part one 8/14/03 9:16 AM Page 29 How to Make Someone Feel Like an Old Friend at Once 29 merely say, “Hello,” “How do you do,” “I am pleased to meet you.” But, inside, it’s a very different story. You will amaze yourself. The delight of rediscovery fills your face and buoys up your body language. I sometimes jokingly say if you were a light, you’d beam on the other person. If you were a dog, you’d be wagging your tail. You make this new person feel very special indeed.*

*Technique #6 Hello Old Friend When meeting someone, imagine he or she is an old friend (an old customer, an old beloved, or someone else you had great affection for). How sad, the vicis- situdes of life tore you two asunder. But, holy mack- erel, now the party (the meeting, the convention) has reunited you with your long-lost old friend! The joyful experience starts a remarkable chain reaction in your body from the subconscious softening of your eyebrows to the positioning of your toes—and everything between. In my seminars, I first have people introduce themselves to another participant before they’ve learned the Hello Old Friend technique. The group chats as though at a pleasant semiformal gathering. Later I ask them to introduce themselves to another stranger, imagining they are old friends. The difference is extraor- dinary. When they’re using Hello Old Friend, the room comes alive. The atmosphere is charged with good feeling. The air sparkles with happier, high-energy people. They are standing closer, laughing more sincerely, and reaching out to one another. I feel like I’m attending a terrific bash that’s been going on for hours.*  

- Page 48 (location ~ 723-736)    

*Not a Word Need Be Spoken The Hello Old Friend technique even supersedes language. When- ever you’re traveling in countries where you don’t speak the native tongue, be sure to use it. If you find yourself with a group of peo- ple who are all speaking a language unknown to you, just imag- ine them to be a group of your old friends. Everything is fine except they momentarily forgot how to speak English. In spite of the fact you won’t understand a word, your whole body still responds with congeniality and acceptance. I’ve used the Hello Old Friend technique while traveling in Europe. Sometimes my English-speaking friends who live there tell me their European colleagues say I am the friendliest Ameri- can they’ve ever met. Yet, we’d never spoken a word between us!*

*An Adelphi University study called, appropriately, “Believing Another Likes or Dislikes You: Behaviors Making the Beliefs Come True” proved it.10 Researchers told vol- unteers to treat unsuspecting subjects as though they liked them. When surveyed later, the results showed the volunteers wound up genuinely liking the subjects. The unsuspecting subjects were also surveyed. These respondents expressed much higher respect and affection for the volunteers who pretended they liked them. What it boils down to is love begets love, like begets like, respect begets respect. Use the Hello Old Friend technique and you will soon have many new “old friends” who wind up genuinely liking you. You now have all the basics to come across to everyone you meet as a Somebody, a friendly Somebody. But your job isn’t over yet. In addition to being liked, you want to appear credible, intel- ligent, and sure of yourself. Each of the next three techniques accomplishes one of those goals.*

*Technique #7 Limit the Fidget Whenever your conversation really counts, let your nose itch, your ear tingle, or your foot prickle. Do not fidget, twitch, wiggle, squirm, or scratch. And above all, keep your paws away from your puss. Hand motions near your face and all fidgeting can give your listener the gut feeling you’re fibbing. Now let’s tackle intelligence. “What?” you ask. “Can people come across as more intelligent than they really are?” Well, did you ever hear of Hans, the counting horse? Hans was considered the most intelligent horse in history, and he used the technique I’m about to suggest.*  

- Page 54 (location ~ 821-827)    

*How to Read People Like You Have ESP Hans, a very clever horse, inspires this next technique. Hans was owned by Herr von Osten, a Berliner, who had trained Hans to do simple arithmetic by tapping his right front hoof. So prodigious was Hans’s ability that the horse’s fame quickly spread throughout Europe in the early 1900s. He became known as Clever Hans, the counting horse. Herr von Osten taught Hans to do more than just add. Soon the horse could subtract and divide. In time, Clever Hans even mastered the multiplication tables. The horse became quite a phe- nomenon. Without his owner uttering a single word, Hans could count out the size of his audience, tap the number wearing glasses, or respond to any counting question they asked him. Finally, Hans achieved the ultimate ability that separates man from animal—language. Hans “learned” the alphabet. By tapping out hoof beats for each letter, he answered any question about any- thing humans had read in a newspaper or heard on the radio. He could even answer common questions about history, geography, and human biology.*  

- Page 54 (location ~ 828-839)    

*Everyone expected Hans to quickly tap out the sum. But Hans remained dumb! Aha! The researchers revealed the truth to the waiting world. Can you guess what that was? Here’s a hint: when the audience or researcher knew the answer, Hans did, too. Now can you guess? People gave off very subtle body-language signals the moment Hans’s hoof gave the right number of taps. When Hans started tapping the answer to a question, the audience would show sub- tle signs of tension. Then, when Hans reached the right number, they responded by an expulsion of breath or slight relaxation of muscles. Von Osten had trained Hans to stop tapping at that point and therefore appear to give the right answer.*  

- Page 57 (location ~ 869-876)    

*Technique #8 Hans’s Horse Sense Make it a habit to get on a dual track while talking. Express yourself, but keep a keen eye on how your listener is reacting to what you’re saying. Then plan your moves accordingly. If a horse can do it, so can a human. People will say you pick up on everything. You never miss a trick. You’ve got horse sense. You now have eight techniques to help you come across as a confident, credible, and charismatic person who makes everyone he or she comes in contact with feel like a million. Let’s explore one last technique in this section to put it all together and make sure you don’t miss a beat.*

*Sports psychologists tell us visualization is not just for top- level competitive athletes. Studies show mental rehearsal helps weekend athletes sharpen their golf, their tennis, their running, whatever their favorite activity. Experts agree if you see the pic- tures, hear the sounds, and feel the movements of your body in your mind before you do the activity, the effect is powerful.*  

- Page 60 (location ~ 913-917)    

*Visualization works best when you feel totally relaxed. Only when you have a calm state of mind can you get clear, vivid images. Do your visualization in the quiet of your home or car before leaving for the party, the convention, or the big-deal meet- ing. See it all in your mind’s eye ahead of time.*  

- Page 61 (location ~ 934-937)    

*Technique #9 Watch the Sc ene Before You Make the Sc ene Rehearse being the Super Somebody you want to be ahead of time. SEE yourself walking around with Hang by Your Teeth posture, shaking hands, smiling the Flooding Smile, and making Sticky Eyes. HEAR your- self chatting comfortably with everyone. FEEL the pleasure of knowing you are in peak form and everyone is gravitating toward you. VISUALIZE yourself a Super Somebody. Then it all happens automatically.*

*Small-talk haters take further consolation from the fact that you are in star-studded company. Fear of small talk and stage fright are the same thing. The butterflies you feel in your stom- ach when you’re in a roomful of strangers flutter ’round the tum- 43 Copyright 2003 by Leil Lowndes.

Carly Simon curtailed live performances because of it. A friend of mine who worked with Neil Diamond said he insisted the words to “Song Sung Blue,” a tune he’d been crooning for forty years, be displayed on his teleprompter, lest fear freeze him into forgetfulness.*  

- Page 63 (location ~ 963-971)    

*Incidentally, science is beginning to recognize it’s not chance or even upbringing that one person has a belly of butterflies and another doesn’t. In our brains, neurons communicate through chemicals called neurotransmitters. Some people have excessive levels of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, a chemical cousin of adrenaline.*  

- Page 64 (location ~ 977-981)    

*You see, small talk is not about facts or words. It’s about music, about melody. Small talk is about putting people at ease. It’s about making comforting noises together like cats purring, children humming, or groups chanting. You must first match your listener’s mood. Like repeating the note on the music teacher’s harmonica, top communicators pick up on their listener’s tone of voice and dupli- cate it. Instead of jumping in with such intensity, the Mensans could have momentarily matched my lethargic mood by saying, “Yes, it is slow, isn’t it?” Had they then prefaced their information with, “Have you ever been curious why an elevator is slow?” I would have responded with a sincere “Yes, I have.” After a moment of equalized energy levels, I would have welcomed their explana- tions about the rail-guard alignment or whatever the heck it was. And friendships might have started.*  

- Page 68 (location ~ 1042-1051)    

*The first step in starting a conversation without strangling it is to match your listener’s mood, if only for a sentence or two. When it comes to small talk, think music, not words. Is your lis- tener adagio or allegro? Match that pace. I call it “Make a Mood Match.”*  

- Page 69 (location ~ 1057-1059)    

*Technique #10 Make a Mood Match Before opening your mouth, take a “voice sample” of your listener to detect his or her state of mind. Take a “psychic photograph” of the expression to see if your listener looks buoyant, bored, or blitzed. If you ever want to bring people around to your thoughts, you must match their mood and voice tone, if only for a moment.*  

- Page 71 (location ~ 1079-1083)    

*Ascent from Banality It is not necessary, of course, to stay with mundane remarks. If you find your company displays cleverness or wit, you match that. The conversation then escalates naturally, compatibly. Don’t rush it or, like the Mensans, you seem like you’re showing off. The bot- tom line on your first words is to have the courage of your own triteness. Because, remember, people tune in to your tone more than your text. Technique #11 Prosaic with Passion Worried about your first words? Fear not, because 80 percent of your listener’s impression has nothing to do with your words anyway. Almost anything you say at first is fine. No matter how prosaic the text, an empathetic mood, a positive demeanor, and passionate delivery make you sound exciting. “Anything, Except Liverwurst!” Back to Dottie waiting for her sandwich at her desk. Sometimes as I walked out the door scratching my head wondering what to bring her, she’d call after me, “Anything, except liverwurst, that is.” Thanks, Dottie, that’s a little bit of help. Here’s my “anything, except liverwurst” on small talk. Any- thing you say is fine as long as it is not complaining, rude, or 02 (043-92B) part two 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 55 How to Sound Like You’ve Got a Super Personality 55 unpleasant. If the first words out of your mouth are a complaint— BLAM—people label you a complainer. Why? Because that com- plaint is your new acquaintance’s 100 percent sampling of you so far. You could be the happiest Pollyanna ever, but how will they know? If your first comment is a complaint, you’re a griper. If your first words are rude, you’re a creep. If your first words are unpleas- ant, you’re a stinker. Open and shut. Other than these downers, anything goes. Ask them where they’re from, how they know the host of the party, where they bought the lovely suit they’re wearing—or hundreds of etceteras. The trick is to ask your prosaic question with passion to get the other person talking.*

*What’s a Whatzit? A Whatzit is anything you wear or carry that is unusual—a unique pin, an interesting purse, a strange tie, or an amusing hat. A Whatzit is any object that draws people’s attention and inspires them to approach you and ask, “Uh, what’s that?” Your Whatzit can be as subtle or overt as your personality and the occasion permit. I wear around my neck an outmoded pair of glasses that resem- bles a double monocle. Often the curious have approached me at a gathering and asked, “Whatzit?” I explain it’s a lorgnette left to me by my grandmother, which, of course, paves the way to discuss hatred of glasses, aging eyes, love or loss of grandmothers, adora- tion of antique jewelry—anywhere the inquisitor wants to take it.*  

- Page 77 (location ~ 1167-1174)    

*Your business cards and your Whatzit are crucial socializing artifacts. Whether you are riding in the elevator, climbing the doorstep, or traversing the path to the party, make sure your Whatzit is hanging out for all to see.*  

- Page 78 (location ~ 1192-1194)    

*Technique #12 Always We ar a What zit Whenever you go to a gathering, wear or carry something unusual to give people who find you the delightful stranger across the crowded room an excuse to approach. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice your . . . what IS that?” The next quickie technique was originated by doggedly de- termined politicians who don’t let one partygoer escape if they think he or she could be helpful to their campaigns. I call it the “Whoozat” technique.*  

- Page 78 (location ~ 1196-1201)    

*If, however, you are loath to pull the party giver away from his or her other guests, you still can perform Whoozat. This time, don’t ask for a formal introduction. Simply pump the party giver for just enough information to launch you. Find out about the stranger’s jobs, interests, and hobbies. Suppose the party giver says, “Oh, that’s Joe Smith. I’m not sure what his job is, but I know he loves to ski.” Aha, you’ve just been given the icebreaker you need. Now you make a beeline for Joe Smith. “Hi, you’re Joe Smith, aren’t you? Susan was just telling me what a great skier you are. Where do you ski?” You get the idea.*  

- Page 79 (location ~ 1208-1215)    

*Technique #13 Wh o oz at Whoozat is the most effective, least used (by non- politicians) meeting-people device ever contrived. Simply ask the party giver to make the introduction, or pump for a few facts that you can immediately turn into icebreakers. Now the third in our little trio of meeting-who-you-want tricks.*  

- Page 80 (location ~ 1217-1221)    

*At parties, stand near the group of people you wish to infil- trate. Then wait for a word or two you can use as a wedge to break into the group. “Excuse me, I couldn’t help overhearing that you . . .” and then whatever is relevant here. For example “I couldn’t help overhearing your discussion of Bermuda. I’m going there next month for the first time. Any suggestions?” Now you are in the circle and can direct your comments to your intended.*  

- Page 81 (location ~ 1230-1234)    

*Technique #14 Eavesdrop In No Whatzit? No host for Whoozat? No problem! Just sidle up behind the swarm of folks you want to infil- trate and open your ears. Wait for any flimsy excuse and jump in with “Excuse me, I couldn’t help but overhear. . . .” Will they be taken aback? Momentarily. Will they get over it? Momentarily. Will you be in the conversation? Absolutely!*

*Do humanity and yourself a favor. Never, ever, give just a one- sentence response to the question, “Where are you from?” Give the asker some fuel for his tank, some fodder for his trough. Give the hun- gry communicator something to conversationally nibble on. All it takes is an extra sentence or two about your city—some interesting fact, some witty observation—to hook the asker into the conversation. Several months ago, a trade association invited me to be its keynote speaker on networking and teaching people to be better conversationalists. Just before my speech, I was introduced to Mrs. Devlin, who was the head of the association. “How do you do?” she asked. “How do you do?” I replied. Then Mrs. Devlin smiled, anxiously awaiting a sample of my stimulating conversational expertise. I asked her where she was from. She plunked a frozen “Columbus, Ohio” and a big expectant grin on my platter. I had to quickly thaw her answer into digestible conversation. My mind thrashed into action. Leil’s thought pat- tern: “Gulp, Columbus, Ohio. I’ve never been there, hmm. Crim- iny, what do I know about Columbus? I know a fellow named Jeff, a successful speaker who lives there. But Columbus is too big to ask if she knows him . . . and besides only kids play the ‘Do-you- know-so-and-so’ game.”*

*Technique #15 Never the Naked City Whenever someone asks you the inevitable, “And where are you from?” never, ever, unfairly challenge their powers of imagination with a one-word answer. Learn some engaging facts about your hometown that conversational partners can comment on. Then, when they say something clever in response to your bait, they think you’re a great conversationalist. Different Bait for Shrimp or Sharks A fisherman uses different bait to bag bass or bluefish. And you will obviously throw out different conversational bait to snag sim- ple shrimp or sophisticated sharks. Your hook should relate to the type of person you’re speaking with. I’m originally from Wash- ington, D.C. If someone at, say, an art gallery asked me where I was from, I might answer “Washington, D.C.—designed, you know, by the same city planner who designed Paris.” This opens the conversational possibilities to the artistry of city planning, Paris, other cities’ plans, European travel, and so forth. At a social party of singles I’d opt for another answer. “I’m from Washington, D.C. The reason I left is there were seven women to every man when I was growing up.” Now the conver- sation can turn to the ecstasy or agony of being single, the per- ceived lack of desirable men everywhere, or even flirtatious possibilities.*

*Technique #16 Never the Naked Job When asked the inevitable “And what do you do,” you may think “I’m an economist/an educator/an engineer” is giving enough information to engender good conversation. However, to one who is not an economist, educator, or an engineer, you might as well be saying “I’m a paleontologist/psychoanalyst/pornographer.” Flesh it out. Throw out some delicious facts about your job for new acquaintances to munch on. Otherwise, they’ll soon excuse themselves, preferring the snacks back at the cheese tray. pany actually discharged a woman for taking extra maternity leave that was a medical necessity.” A mother can relate to that. Talking with a business owner? Say “I’m an attorney. Our firm specializes in employment law. My current case concerns an employer who is being sued by one of her staff for asking personal questions during the initial job interview.” A business owner can relate to that.*

*Technique #17 Ne ver the Nake d Introduc tion When introducing people, don’t throw out an unbaited hook and stand there grinning like a big clam, leaving the newlymets to flutter their fins and fish for a topic. Bait the conversational hook to get them in the swim of things. Then you’re free to stay or float on to the next networking opportunity. If you’re not comfortable mentioning someone’s job during the introduction, mention their hobby or even a talent. The other day at a gathering, the hostess introduced a man named Gilbert. She said, “Leil, I’d like you to meet Gilbert. Gilbert’s gift is sculpt- ing. He makes beautiful wax carvings.” I remember thinking, “Gift—now that’s a lovely way to introduce someone and induce conversation.”*

*Top communicators know ideas don’t come out of nowhere. If Mrs. Otis thought to bring up plants, then she must have some relationship with them. Furthermore, by mentioning the word, it meant subconsciously she wanted to talk about plants. Suppose, for example, instead of responding to Nancy’s com- ment about the rain with “It’s good for the plants,” Mrs. Otis had said, “Because of the rain, my dog couldn’t go out.” Nancy could then ask about her dog. Or suppose she grumbled, “It’s bad for my arthritis.” Can you guess what old Mrs. Otis wants to talk about now? When talking with anyone, keep your ears open and, like a good detective, listen for clues. Be on the lookout for any unusual references: any anomaly, deviation, digression, or invocation of 02 (043-92B) part two 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 75 How to Resuscitate a Dying Conversation 75 another place, time, person. Ask about it because it’s the clue to what your conversation partner would really enjoy discussing.*  

- Page 93 (location ~ 1425-1436)    

*Technique #18 Be a Word Detec tive Like a good gumshoe, listen to your conversation partner’s every word for clues to his or her preferred topic. The evidence is bound to slip out. Then spring on that subject like a sleuth on to a slip of the tongue. Like Sherlock Holmes, you have the clue to the subject that’s hot for the other person. Now that you’ve ignited stimulating conversation, let’s explore a technique to keep it hot.*

*Does this man have an interesting life or what? Yet Dan, when meeting Diane, said nothing about himself. I told Dan about how pleased Diane was to meet him yet how little she learned about his life. Dan simply replied, “Well, when I meet someone, I learn so much more if I ask about their life. I always try to turn the spotlight on the other person.” Truly con- fident people often do this. They know they grow more by listen- ing than talking. Obviously, they also captivate the talker.*

*He tells his students of a giant spotlight that, when shining on their product, is not as interesting to the prospect. When they shine the spotlight on the prospect, they make the sale. Salespeople, this technique is especially crucial for you. Keep your “Swiveling Spotlight” aimed away from you, only lightly on your product, and most brightly on your buyer. You’ll do a much better job of selling yourself and your product.*  

- Page 96 (location ~ 1471-1475)    

*Technique #19 The Swiv eling Spotlight When you meet someone, imagine a giant revolving spotlight between you. When you’re talking, the spotlight is on you. When the new person is speaking, it’s shining on him or her. If you shine it brightly enough, the stranger will be blinded to the fact that you have hardly said a word about yourself. The longer you keep it shining away from you, the more interesting he or she finds you.*

*Moments arise, of course, when even conversationalists extraordi- naire hit the wall. Some folks’ monosyllabic grunts leave slim pick- ings even for masters of the Be a Word Detective technique. If you find yourself futilely fanning the embers of a dying conversation (and if you feel for political reasons or human com- passion that the conversation should continue), here’s a foolproof trick to get the fire blazing again. I call it “Parroting” after that beautiful tropical bird that captures everyone’s heart simply by repeating other people’s words.*  

- Page 97 (location ~ 1482-1487)    

*Technique #20 Parroting Never be left speechless again. Like a parrot, simply repeat the last few words your conversation partner says. That puts the ball right back in his or her court, and then all you need to do is listen. Salespeople, why go on a wild goose chase for a customer’s real objections when it’s so easy to shake them out of the trees with Parroting?*  

- Page 100 (location ~ 1521-1525)    

*Technique #21 Encore! The sweetest sound a performer can hear welling up out of the applause is “Encore! Encore! Let’s hear it again!” The sweetest sound your conversation partner can hear from your lips when you’re talking with a group of people is “Tell them about the time you . . .” Whenever you’re at a meeting or party with someone important to you, think of some stories he or she told you. Choose an appropriate one from their repertoire that the crowd will enjoy. Then shine the spotlight by requesting a repeat performance.*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1610-1616)    

*The added benefit of this technique is that, once you’ve got them up and running with their conversation, you can sneak off and find more interesting company! One word of warning: make sure the story you request is one in which the teller shines. No one wants to retell the time they lost the sale, cracked up the car, or broke up the bar and spent the night in jail. Make sure your requested Encore! is a positive story where they come out the big winner, not the buffoon. The full beauty of this technique will hit you like a happy thunderbolt the first time you use it with someone who is telling a long and wearisome tale. You simply tiptoe away and let the bore spin the story on and on with your friend. (Of course, your friend may never speak to you again. But that’s not germaine to this chapter!) The next technique deals with sharing some positive stories of your life.*

*One study showed that if someone is above you in stature, their revealing a foible brings them closer to you.12 The holes in the bottom of presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson’s shoes charmed a nation, as did George H. W. Bush’s shocking admission that he couldn’t stomach broccoli. If you’re on sure footing, say a superstar who wants to become friends with a fan, go ahead and tell your devotees about the time you were out of work and penniless. But if you’re not a superstar, better play it safe and keep the skeletons in the closet until later. People don’t know you well enough to put your foible in context.*  

- Page 107 (location ~ 1632-1638)    

*Technique #22 Ac-c en-tu-ate the Pos-i-tive When first meeting someone, lock your closet door and save your skeletons for later. You and your new good friend can invite the skeletons out, have a good laugh, and dance over their bones later in the relationship. But now’s the time, as the old song says, to “ac-cen-tu-ate the pos-i-tive and elim-i-nate the neg-a-tive.” So far, in this section, you have found assertive methods for meeting people and mastering small talk. The next is both an assertive and defensive move to help spare you that pasty smile we tend to sport when we have no idea what people are talking about.*

*Technique #23 The L atest Ne ws . . . Don’t Le av e Home Without It The last move to make before leaving for the party— even after you’ve given yourself final approval in the mirror—is to turn on the radio news or scan your newspaper. Anything that happened today is good material. Knowing the big-deal news of the moment is also a defensive move that rescues you from putting your foot in your mouth by asking what everybody’s talking about. Foot-in-mouth is not very tasty in public, especially when it’s surrounded by egg-on-face. Sidney told me she had a house rule when she was in business. All of her female “independent contractors” were directed to keep up with the daily news so they could be good conversationalists with their clients.*

*Humans start the process by looking at each other and talking. In the business world, while smiling and uttering “How do you do?” “Hello,” “Howdy,” or “Hi,” they are, like tigers, instinctively, instantaneously, sizing each other up. They’re not calculating the length of each other’s claws or the sharpness of their teeth. They’re judging each other on a weapon far more powerful to survival as they have defined it. Humans are judging each other’s communications skills. Although they may not know the names of the specific studies first proving it, they sense the truth: 85 percent of one’s success in life is directly due to communications skills.13*

*Big cats never ask outright, “What do you do?” (Oh they find out, all right, in a much more subtle manner.) By not asking the question, the big boys and big girls come across as more princi- pled, even spiritual. “After all,” their silence says, “a man or woman is far more than his or her job.” Resisting the tempting question also shows their sensitivity. With so much downsizing, rightsizing, and capsizing of corpora- tions these days, the blunt interrogation evokes uneasiness. The job question is not just unpleasant for those who are “between engagements.” I have several gainfully employed friends who hate being asked, “And what do you do?” (One of these folks cuts cadavers for autopsies, the other is an IRS collection agent.)*

- Page 113 (location ~ 1729-1736)    

*Technique #24 What Do You Do—NOT! A sure sign you’re a Somebody is the conspicuous ab- sence of the question, “What do you do?” (You deter- mine this, of course, but not with those four dirty words that label you as either a ruthless networker, a social climber, a gold-digging husband or wife hunter, or someone who’s never strolled along Easy Street.) The Right Way to Find Out So how do you find out what someone does for a living? (I thought you’d never ask.) You simply practice the following eight words. All together now: “How . . . do . . . you . . . spend . . . most . . . of . . . your . . . time?”*

*Boys and girls in the big leagues, however, have bits and bytes of their entire work experience tucked away in their computers. When applying for a job, they punch up only the appropriate data and print it out so it looks like it just came from the printer. My friend Roberto was out of work last year. He applied for two positions:a sales manager of an ice cream company and head of strategic planning for a fast-food chain. He did extensive research and found the ice cream company had deep sales diffi- culties and the food chain had long-range international aspirations.*

*To make the most of every encounter, personalize your verbal résumé with just as much care as you would your written cur- riculum vitae. Instead of having one answer to the omnipresent “What do you do?” prepare a dozen or so variations, depending on who’s asking. For optimum networking, every time someone asks about your job, give a calculated oral résumé in a nutshell. Before you submit your answer, consider what possible interest the asker could have in you and your work. “Here’s How My Life Can Benefit Yours” Top salespeople talk extensively of the “benefit statement.” They know, when talking with a potential client, they should open their conversation with a benefit statement. When my colleague Brian makes cold calls, instead of saying “Hello, my name is Brian Tracy. I’m a sales trainer,” he says, “Hello, my name is Brian Tracy from the Institute for Executive Development. Would you be interested in a proven method that can increase your sales from 20 to 30 per- cent over the next twelve months?” That is his benefit statement. He highlights the specific benefits of what he has to offer to his prospect.*

*Don’t say “martial arts instructor.” Say “I help people defend themselves by teaching martial arts.” Don’t say “cosmetic surgeon.” Say “I reconstruct people’s faces after disfiguring accidents.” (Or, if you’re talking with a woman “of a certain age,” as the French so gracefully say, tell her, “I help people to look as young as they feel through cos- metic surgery.”) Don’t say “hairdresser.” Say “I help a woman find the right hairstyle for her particular face.” (Go, Gloria!)*  

- Page 119 (location ~ 1821-1826)    

*Technique #25 The Nutshell Résumé Just as job-seeking top managers roll a different written résumé off their printers for each position they’re applying for, let a different true story about your professional life roll off your tongue for each listener. Before responding to “What do you do?” ask yourself, “What possible interest could this person have in my answer? Could he refer business to me? Buy from me? Hire me? Marry my sister? Become my buddy?” Wherever you go, pack a nutshell about your own life to work into your communications bag of tricks.*

*The world perceives people with rich vocabularies to be more creative, more intelligent. People with larger vocabularies get hired quicker, promoted faster, and listened to a whole lot more. So big winners use rich, full words, but they never sound inappropriate. The phrases slide gracefully off their tongues to enrich their con- versation. The words fit. With the care that they choose their tie or their blouse, big players in life choose words to match their per- sonalities and their points.*

*And Now, for Men Only Gentlemen, we women spend a lot of time in front of the mirror (as if you didn’t know). When I was in college, it used to take me a full fifteen minutes to fix myself up for a date. Every year since, I’ve had to add a few minutes. I’m now up to an hour and a half gussying myself up for an evening out. Gentlemen, when your wife comes down the staircase all dolled up for a night out, or you pick a lady up for dinner, what do you say? If you make no comment except, “Well, are you ready to go?” how do you think that makes the lady feel?*

*Technique #26 Your Personal Thesaurus Look up some common words you use every day in the thesaurus. Then, like slipping your feet into a new pair of shoes, slip your tongue into a few new words to see how they fit. If you like them, start making permanent replacements. Remember, only fifty words makes the difference between a rich, creative vocabulary and an average, middle-of-the-road one. Substitute a word a day for two months and you’ll be in the verbally elite.*

*How to Not Sound Anxious (Let Them Discover Your Similarity) Tigers prowl with tigers; lions lurk with lions; and little alley cats scramble around with other little alley cats. Similarity breeds attraction. But in the human jungle, big cats know a secret. When you delay revealing your similarity, or let them discover it, it has much more punch. Above all, you don’t want to sound anxious to have rapport.*  

- Page 125 (location ~ 1915-1919)    

*Technique #27 Kill the Quick “Me , Too!” Whenever you have something in common with someone, the longer you wait to reveal it, the more moved (and impressed) he or she will be. You emerge as a confident big cat, not a lonely little stray, hungry for quick connection with a stranger.*  

- Page 128 (location ~ 1957-1960)    

*“SEX! Now that I have your attention. . . . ” Two-bit comics have been using that gag from the days when two bits bought a foursquare meal. However, big winners know there’s a three-letter word more potent then SEX to get people’s attention. That word is YOU. Why is you such a powerful word? Because when we were infants, we thought we were the center of the universe. Nothing mattered but ME, MYSELF, and I. The rest of the shadowy forms stirring about us (which we later learned were other people) existed solely for what they could do for us. Self-centered little tykes that we were, our tiny brains translated every action, every word, into, “How does that affect ME?” Big winners know we haven’t changed a bit. Adults camouflage their self-centeredness under a mask of civilization and politeness. Yet the human brain still immediately, instinctively, and unfailingly translates everything into terms of “How does that affect ME?” For example, suppose, gentlemen, you want to ask a colleague, Jill, if she would like to join you for dinner. So you say to her, “There’s a really good new Indian restaurant in town. Will you join me there for dinner tonight?”*  

- Page 129 (location ~ 1963-1975)    

*The pleasure-pain principle is a guiding force in life. Psy- chologists tell us everyone automatically gravitates toward that which is pleasurable and pulls away from that which is painful. For many people, thinking is painful. So big winners (when they wish to control, inspire, be loved by, sell to people, or get them to go to dinner) do the thinking for them. They translate everything into the other person’s terms by starting as many sentences as they can with that powerful little three-letter word, you. Thus, I call the technique “Comm-YOU-nication.” Comm-YOU-nicate When You Want a Favor Putting you first gets a much better response, especially when you’re asking a favor, because it pushes the asker’s pride button. Suppose you want to take a long weekend. You decide to ask your boss if you can take Friday off. Which request do you think he or she is going to react to more positively? “Can I take Friday off, Boss?” Or this one: “Boss, can you do without me Friday?” In the first case, Boss had to translate your “Can I take Friday off ?” into “Can I do without this employee Friday?” That’s an extra thought process. (And you know how some bosses hate to think!)*  

- Page 130 (location ~ 1984-1997)    

*Technique #28 Comm-YOU-nic ation Start every appropriate sentence with you. It immedi- ately grabs your listener’s attention. It gets a more positive response because it pushes the pride button and saves them having to translate it into “me” terms. When you sprinkle you as liberally as salt and pepper throughout your conversation, your listeners find it an irresistible spice. I’m sure when they recover the flight box from the Fall of Man under a fig leaf in the Garden of Eden, it will convince the world of the power of the word you. Eve did not ask Adam to eat the apple. She did not command him to eat the apple. She didn’t even 03 (093-142B) part three 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 114 114 How to Talk to Anyone say, “Adam, I want you to eat this apple.” She phrased it (as all big winners would), “You will love this apple.” That’s why he bit.*  

- Page 133 (location ~ 2027-2036)    

*Continuing up the sanity scale, the fewer times you use I, the more sane you seem to your listeners. If you eavesdrop on big win- ners talking with each other, you’ll notice a lot more you than I in their conversation. The next technique concerns a way big winners are silently you-oriented.*  

- Page 133 (location ~ 2040-2043)    

*Why did this man’s stock shoot high in my ticker one minute and plummet the next? Because his smile, although charming, reflected no special reaction to me. Obviously, he gave the same smile to everybody and, by that, it lost all its specialness. If Strobe Man had given each of us a slightly different smile, he would have appeared sensitive and insightful. (Of course, if his smile had been just a tad bigger for me than for the others, I couldn’t have waited for the formalities to be over to seek him out in the crowded ballroom.) Review Your Repertoire of Smiles If your job required you to carry a gun, you would, of course, learn all about the moving parts before firing it. And before taking aim, you would carefully consider whether it would murder, maim, or merely wound your target. Since your smile is one of your biggest communications weapons, learn all about the moving parts and the effect on your target. Set aside five minutes. Lock your bedroom or bathroom door so your family doesn’t think you’ve gone off the deep end. Now stand in front of the mirror and flash a few smiles. Discover the subtle differences in your repertoire. Just as you would alternate saying “Hello,” “How do you do,” and “I am pleased to meet you” when being introduced to a group 03 (093-142B) part three 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 117 How to Make Them Feel You “Don’t Smile at Just Anybody” 117 of people, vary your smile. Don’t use the same on each. Let each of your smiles reflect the nuances of your sentiment about the recipient.*  

- Page 135 (location ~ 2064-2080)    

*Technique #29 The E xclusiv e Smile If you flash everybody the same smile, like a Confed- erate dollar, it loses value. When meeting groups of people, grace each with a distinct smile. Let your smiles grow out of the beauty big players find in each new face. If one person in a group is more important to you than the others, reserve an especially big, flooding smile just for him or her.*  

- Page 136 (location ~ 2081-2085)    

*The smile’s pickup power was proven for posterity by solemn researchers at the University of Missouri. They conducted a highly controlled study titled “Giving Men the Come-On: Effect of Eye Contact and Smiling in a Bar Environment.”15 (I kid you not.) To prove their hypothesis, female researchers made eye contact with unsuspecting male subjects enjoying a little libation in a local drinking establishment. Sometimes, the female researchers fol- lowed their glance with a smile. In other cases, no smile.*  

- Page 137 (location ~ 2088-2093)    

*The results? I quote the study: “The highest approach behav- ior, 60 percent, was observed in the condition in which there was smiling.” That translates into layman’s English: “The guy came over 60 percent of the time when the lady smiled.” Without the smile, he “made the approach only 20 percent of the time.” So, yes, a smile works for those who wish to pick somebody up. However, in situations where the stakes are higher, try The Flooding Smile from the first section and now The Exclusive Smile.*

*Big winners silently moan when they hear someone mouth a trite overworn phrase. Oh sure, just like the rest of us, big win- ners find themselves feeling fit as a fiddle, happy as a lark, or high as a kite. Like the rest of humanity, they consider some of their acquaintances crazy as a loon, nutty as a fruitcake, or blind as a bat. Because many of them work hard, many of them are as busy as a bee and get rich as Croesus. Yet would any of them describe themselves in those words? Not in a coon’s age! Why? Because when a big winner hears your cliché, you might as well be saying, “My powers of imagination are impoverished. I can’t think of anything original to say, so I must fall back on these trite overworn phrases.”*  

- Page 138 (location ~ 2107-2114)    

*Technique #30 Don’t Touch a Cliché with a Ten-Foot Pole Be on guard. Don’t use any clichés when chatting with big winners. Don’t even touch one with a ten-foot pole. Never? Not even when hell freezes over? Not unless you want to sound dumb as a doorknob. Instead of coughing up a cliché, roll your own clever phrases by using the next technique.*

*How to Use Motivational Speakers’ Techniques to Enhance Your Conversation They say the pen is mightier than the sword. It is, but the tongue is even mightier than the pen. Our tongues can bring crowds to laughter, to tears, and often to their feet in shouting appreciation. Orators have moved nations to war or brought lost souls to God. And what is their equipment? The same eyes, ears, hands, legs, arms, and vocal chords you and I have. Perhaps a professional athlete has a stronger body or a profes- sional singer is blessed with a more beautiful singing voice than the one we were doled out. But the professional speaker starts out with the same equipment we all have. The difference is, these jaw- smiths use it all. They use their hands, they use their bodies, and they use specific gestures with heavy impact. They think about the space they’re talking in. They employ many different tones of voice, they invoke various expressions, they vary the speed with which they speak . . . and they make effective use of silence.*  

- Page 139 (location ~ 2122-2132)    

*A Gem for Every Occasion If stirring words help make your point, ponder the impact of pow- erful phrases. They’ve helped politicians get elected (“Read my lips: no new taxes.”) and defendants get acquitted (“If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit.”). If George H. W. Bush had said, “I promise not to raise taxes,” or Johnny Cochran, during O. J. Simpson’s criminal trial, had said, “If the glove doesn’t fit, he must be innocent,” their bulky sen- tences would have slipped in and out of the voter’s or juror’s con- sciousness. As every politician and trial lawyer knows, neat phrases make powerful weapons. (If you’re not careful, your enemies will later use them against you—read my lips!)*

*Many speakers use author’s and speaker’s agent Lilly Walters’s face-saver lines from her book, What to Say When You’re Dying on the Platform.16 If you tell a joke and no one laughs, try “That joke was designed to get a silent laugh—and it worked.” If the micro- phone lets out an agonizing howl, look at it and say, “I don’t under- stand. I brushed my teeth this morning.” If someone asks you a question you don’t want to answer, “Could you save that question until I’m finished—and well on my way home?” All pros think of holes they might fall into and then memorize great escape lines. You can do the same.*

*Look through books of similes to enrich your day-to-day con- versations. Instead of “happy as a lark” try “happy as a lottery win- ner” or “happy as a baby with its first ice cream cone.” Instead of “bald as an eagle,” try “bald as a new marine” or “bald as a bull- frog’s belly.” Instead of “quiet as a mouse,” try “quiet as an eel swimming in oil” or “quiet as a fly lighting on a feather duster.” Find phrases that have visual impact. Instead of a cliché like “sure as death and taxes,” try “as certain as beach traffic in July” or “as sure as your shadow will follow you.” Your listeners can’t see death or taxes. But they sure can see beach traffic in July or their shadow following them down the street. Try to make your similes relate to the situation.*

*Big players who want to be quoted in the media lie awake at night gnawing the pillow trying to come up with phrases the press will pick up. A Michigan veterinarian named Timothy, a heavy hitter in his own field but completely unknown outside it, made national headlines when he planned to attach a pair of feet to a rooster who lost his to frostbite. Why? Because he called it a “drumstick transplant.”*

*Technique #31 Us e Jawsmith’s Jiv e Whether you’re standing behind a podium facing thousands or behind the barbecue grill facing your family, you’ll move, amuse, and motivate with the same skills. Read speakers’ books to cull quotations, pull pearls of wisdom, and get gems to tickle their funny bones. Find a few bon mots to let casually slide off your tongue on chosen occasions. If you want to be notable, dream up a crazy quotable. Make ’em rhyme, make ’em clever, or make ’em funny. Above all, make ’em relevant.*

*What are some differences between a big cat’s growl and a lit- tle cat’s insignificant hiss? One of the most blatant is euphemisms. Big cats aren’t afraid of real words. They call a spade a spade. Words like toilet paper don’t scare them. Little cats hide behind bathroom tissue. If somebody is rich, big cats call it “rich.” Little cats, oh so embarrassed at the concept of talking about money in polite company, substitute the word wealthy. When little cats use a substitute word or euphemism, they might as well be saying, “Whoops, you are better than I am. I’m in polite company now and so I’ll use the nicey-nice word.” Big cats are anatomically correct—no cutesy words for body parts.*  

- Page 146 (location ~ 2225-2232)    

*Technique #32 Call a Spade a Spade Don’t hide behind euphemisms. Call a spade a spade. That doesn’t mean big cats use tasteless four-letter words when perfectly decent five- and six-letter ones exist. They’ve simply learned the King’s English, and they speak it. Here’s another way to tell the big players from the little ones just by listening to a few minutes of their conversation.*  

- Page 146 (location ~ 2238-2242)    

*Technique #33 Trash the Te asing A dead giveaway of a little cat is his or her proclivity to tease. An innocent joke at someone else’s expense may get you a cheap laugh. Nevertheless, the big cats will have the last one. Because you’ll bang your head against the glass ceiling they construct to keep little cats from stepping on their paws. Never, ever, make a joke at anyone else’s expense. You’ll wind up paying for it, dearly.*

*Technique #34 It’s the Rec eiv er’s Ball A football player wouldn’t last two beats of the time clock if he made blind passes. A pro throws the ball with the receiver always in mind. Before throwing out any news, keep your receiver in mind. Then deliver it with a smile, a sigh, or a sob. Not according to how you feel about the news, but how the receiver will take it. Had my neighbor told me of the impending rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning. Had the Grey- hound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said, “Oh, that’s all right. 03 (093-142B) part three 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 133 How to Give Them the Bad News (and Have Them Like You All the More) 133 I’ll catch the next one.” Big winners, when they bear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion the bombarded person is sure to have. Big winners know how to give bad news to people. They also know how not to give any news to anyone, even when people are pressuring them. Let’s explore that next.*

*Technique #35 The Broken Record Whenever someone persists in questioning you on an unwelcome subject, simply repeat your original response. Use precisely the same words in precisely the same tone of voice. Hearing it again usually quiets them down. If your rude interrogator hangs on like a leech, your next repetition never fails to flick them off.*

*If it’s your boss’s boss’s boss’s boss whom the fates have sent to bask in your adulation, do the same. Do not say “Bill” or “Mr. Gates, you really run a great company.” “Lowly geek,” he thinks, “who are you to judge?” Instead, tell him what an honor it is to work for him. Obviously this is not the moment to detail the intricacies of your improvements on image- editing software for digitizing photographs. Then let your body language express that if Woody or Bill or the other megastar wants to leave it at that, you are happy with the exchange. If, however, the megastar is captivated by you (or has had so much liquid merriment that he or she has decided to mingle with the masses tonight), then all bets are off. You’re on your own. Enjoy! Until you pick up the first body-language sign that they would like to end it. Think of yourself as a ballroom dance student waltzing with your teacher. He leads, you follow.*  

- Page 154 (location ~ 2351-2360)    

*Incidentally, if the megastar is with a companion and your conversation goes on for more than a few moments, direct some comments at the companion. If the satellite is in such stellar com- pany, he or she is probably also an accomplished person. Felicia, a friend of mine, is a talented trial lawyer who is mar- ried to a local TV-show host. Because Tom is on television, peo- ple recognize him wherever they go, and Felicia gets ignored. Felicia tells me how frustrating it is, even for Tom. Whenever they go to a party, people gush all over Tom, and Felicia’s fascinating work hardly ever gets mentioned. She and Tom used to love going out to dinner, but now they hide out at home in the evenings.*

*Technique #36 Big Shots Don’t Slobber People who are VIPs in their own right don’t slobber over celebrities. When you are chatting with one, don’t compliment her work, simply say how much pleasure or insight it’s given you. If you do single out any one of the star’s accomplishments, make sure it’s a recent one, not a memory that’s getting yellow in her scrapbook. If the queen bee has a drone sitting with her, find a way to involve him in the conversation. A final celebrity codicil: Suppose you are fortunate enough to have one at your party. To shine some star light on your party, don’t ask the TV host to “say a few words.” Don’t ask the singer 03 (093-142B) part three 8/14/03 9:17 AM Page 139 How to Talk to a Celebrity 139 to sing a song. What looks effortless to the rest of us because they seem so comfortable performing is work for them. You wouldn’t ask an accountant guest to look over your books. Or a dentist to check out your third left molar. Let the dignitary drink. Let the luminary laugh. Celebrities are people, too, and they like their time off.*

*How to Make Them Want to Thank You To wrap up our section on sounding like the big boys and big girls, here is a simple and gracious little maneuver. It not only signals people you’re a top communicator, but it encourages them to keep doing nice things for you. Or complimenting you. Or doing busi- ness with you. Or loving you. It is very short. It is very sweet. It is very simple. You can use it with everyone in your life. When it becomes instinctive, you’ll find yourself using it every day.*

From A to Z, always follow it with for: from “Thank you for asking” to “Thank you for zipping me up.” Thank you for reading this section of How to Talk to Anyone! Now let us move on to another conversation challenge, how to talk knowledgeably with everyone—from groups of accountants to Zen Buddhists—no matter how little you might have in common.*

*Go Fly a Kite! The “Scramble Therapy” technique is salvation from such disap- pointing encounters. It will transform you into a modern-day Renaissance man or woman who comfortably can discuss a vari- ety of interests. Scramble Therapy is, quite simply, scrambling up your life and participating in an activity you’d never think of indulging in. Just one out of every four weekends, do something totally out of your pattern. Do you usually play tennis on weekends? This weekend, go hiking. Do you usually go hiking? This weekend, take a ten- nis lesson. Do you bowl? Leave that to your buddies this time. Instead, go white-water rafting. Oh, you were planning on run- ning some rapids like you do every warm weekend? Forget it, go bowling. Go to a stamp exhibition. Go to a chess lecture. Go balloon- ing. Go bird-watching. Go to a pool hall. Go kayaking. Go fly a kite! Why? Because it will give you conversational fodder for the rest of your life.*

*If you take a piece of blue litmus paper and dip it in a huge vat of acid, the tip turns pink. If you take another blue litmus paper and dip it into just one minuscule drop of acid on a glass slide, the tip turns just as pink. Compare this to participating in an activity just one time. A sampling gives you 80 percent of the conversa- tional value. You learn the insider’s questions to ask. You start using the right terms. You’ll never be at a loss again when the subject of extracurricular interests comes up—which it always does.*  

- Page 162 (location ~ 2484-2489)    

*Technique #38 Scramble Therapy Once a month, scramble your life. Do something you’d never dream of doing. Participate in a sport, go to an exhibition, hear a lecture on something totally out of your experience. You get 80 percent of the right lingo and insider questions from just one exposure. Think about it! Suppose at a dinner party, the table conversa- tion turns to scuba diving. If you, too, had done your one-time- only dive, you’d ask your diving dinner companion if he likes night diving or whether he prefers diving on wrecks or reefs. (He’ll never 04 (143-170B) part four 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 149 How to Be a Modern-Day Renaissance Man or Woman 149 believe it when you tell him the deepest water you’ve ever sub- merged yourself in is your own bathtub.) Then you turn to the bungee jumper seated on your left and ask him, “Do you prefer chest-waist jumps or ankle jumps?” If the conversation then changes to tennis, or martial arts, or chess, or coin collecting, or even bird-watching, you can keep up and keep the conversation going. What a guy! What a gal!*

*Technique #39 Le arn a Lit tle Jobble dygook Big winners speak Jobbledygook as a second language. What is Jobbledygook? It’s the language of other professions. Why speak it? It makes you sound like an insider. How do you learn it? You’ll find no Jobbledygook cassettes in the language section of your bookstore, but the lingo is easy to pick up. Simply ask a friend who speaks the lingo of the crowd you’ll be with to teach you a few opening questions. The words are few and the rewards are manifold. That’s all you need to get started—two good opening art questions and a warning against the most-asked dumb outsider question.*

*Technique #40 Baring Their Hot But ton Before jumping blindly into a bevy of bookbinders or a drove of dentists, find out what the hot issues are in their fields. Every industry has burning concerns the outside world knows little about. Ask your informant to bare the industry buzz. Then, to heat the conversation up, push those buttons. Back to the art show you’re about to attend. You can’t let Sally hang up yet. She’s given you the two best opening questions for 04 (143-170B) part four 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 156 156 How to Talk to Anyone artists. But don’t let her go until you get the real conversational grabber. Ask her the hottest issues going on in the art world. She might think a minute and then say, “Well, there’s always art prices.” “Art prices?” you ask. “Yes,” she explains. “For example, in the 1980s the art world was very market-driven. Prices went sky-high because some investors and status seekers paid exorbitant amounts. We feel that kind of took art away from the masses.” Wow, now you’re really armed with some good insider art talk!*

*How to Secretly Learn About Their Lives Let’s say your paper carrier has just hurled the newspaper from his bike to your front door. You pour a cup of coffee and get com- fortable to catch up on what’s happening in the world. Your world, that is. Do you flip first to the international news? The fashion sec- tion? The sports page? The entertainment section? Maybe the comics? Whichever section you usually flip to first, tomorrow DON’T. Turn to any other section, preferably one you hardly ever read. Why? Because it will familiarize you with other worlds so that you can soon discuss anything with anybody, no matter how little you have in common. How about the real estate section? Yawn. Maybe you don’t find real estate especially engrossing. However, sooner or later you’re going to find yourself with a group of people who are dis- cussing properties, deals, and today’s market. Scanning the real estate section just once every few weeks will keep you au courant with their conversation.*

*Using outsider words is one of the biggest giveaways that you are not in the know. On the ship, if a passenger asked any of my staff, “How long have you been working on the boat?” they’d squelch a groan. Cruise staffers proudly worked on a ship, and the word boat revealed the passenger as a real landlubber. The right word can perform conversational miracles. In the receiving line, whenever passengers asked our laconic captain, “When did you first become a master?” or “What was your first command?” he would hold up the entire line of people snaking around the ballroom waiting to shake his hand. Captain Cafiero would enthusiastically recount his naval history to the savvy inquirer who might have just learned the words master or com- mand last week in the newspaper shipping notices. (If the passen- ger had simply said, “How long have you been a captain?” or “What was your first boat?” he or she would have gotten the cap- tain’s usual Italian gentleman’s version of the bum’s rush.)*

*When it comes to people’s hobbies and interests, browse through magazines on running, working out, bicycling, skiing, swimming, and surfing. Large magazine stores carry biker rags, boxer rags, bowler rags, even bull-riding rags. You’ll find thousands of special-interest magazines published every month.*

*Technique #41 Re ad Their Rags Is your next big client a golfer, runner, swimmer, surfer, or skier? Are you attending a social function filled with accountants or Zen Buddhists—or anything in between? There are untold thousands of monthly magazines serving every imaginable interest. You can dish up more information than you’ll ever need to sound like an insider with anyone just by reading the rags that serve their racket. (Have you read your latest copy of Zoonooz yet?)*

*“Oh, it’s beautiful!” as she gave each of the gentlemen a little hug. At this point, the four Japanese gentlemen stood up in uni- son like four frowning Siamese twins and, bowing only very slightly, mumbled “Sayonara” and promptly left. Poor Geri was flabbergasted. What did she do wrong? Everything! First, the jeans. Even if you’re coming off a bicy- cle in Asia, you do not meet clients casually dressed. The second mistake was Geri’s vulgar handling of their business cards. In Asia, the business card is one of the most important protocol tools. It is always presented and accepted reverently with both hands. (Except in Moslem Asia where the left hand is considered unclean.) Geri then put their cards away much too quickly. In Asia, peo- ple use business cards as a conversation starter. You chat about each other’s cards and work and do not put theirs away until they gen- tly and respectfully place yours in safekeeping. Shoving it into her back jeans pocket was the ultimate disrespect. Geri didn’t discover her fourth gaffe until she returned home.*

Before you shake hands, give a gift, make gestures, or even compliment anyone’s possessions, check it out. Your gaffe could gum up your entire gig. 04 (143-170B) part four 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 164 164 How to Talk to Anyone There are some excellent books on international customs.

*A little bit of knowledge goes a long way when you’re buying something. If you have insight into your real estate broker’s bot- tom line, he’s more apt to give you the better price. If you are facile with the insider words caterers and car salesmen use to pad their profits, if you’re savvy to techniques moving companies and mechanics use to bilk the unsuspecting, if you are on the lookout for lawyers’ methods of fattening fees—in short, if you know the ropes, you will not get ripped off. You don’t need to know a lot, just a few insider terms. The pro assumes, since you are conver- sant in some esoteric industry terms, you also know the best deal and rock-bottom price. No one put it better than my housepainter, Iggy. “Sure,” he told me, “you gotta know how to talk to a painter. Not me, but a lotta them other guys, they’re gonna get whatever they can. It’s only human nature. Especially if you’re a woman and you deal with ’em smart, like I’m gonna tell you how, their hair will stand on end. They’ll say to themselves, ‘Hey, dis is no babe in the woods. I bet- ter deal straight.’ ” “OK, Iggy, how?” He said, “Tell them guys, ‘Look the walls need very little prep- ping. You’re not going to have to spend much time scraping and spackling. It’s a clean job.’ ” Iggy told me these few sentences alone 04 (143-170B) part four 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 168 168 How to Talk to Anyone can save you hundreds of dollars. Why? Right away the painter knows you know the score and that the most time-consuming part for him is preparing the surface (prepping in painterese).*

*How to Deal When There’s No Iggy in Your Life Here’s how to get the best price and the best deal from anyone. Find your Iggy Informer. If you have a friend in the business, get the lingo from him. If not, instead of going straight to the vendor you want to buy from, visit several others first. Talk with them. Learn a little lingo from each. For instance, suppose you want to buy a diamond. Instead of going right to your favorite jewelry shop and asking dumbbell dia- mond questions, go to the competition. Make friends with the salesclerk and pick up a few gems of diamondese. You’ll learn jew- elers say stones, not diamonds. When you’re talking about the top of the stone, they say table; the widest part is the girdle; the bot- tom is the cutlet. If the stone looks yellow, don’t say yellow, say cape. If you see flaws, don’t say flaws, say inclusions or gletz. If you still don’t like the stone, don’t say “I’d like to see something better,” say finer. (Don’t ask me why. That’s just the way the diamond crowd talks.) Then, when you’ve got your lingo down, go to where you want to buy. Because you now speak diamond, you get a much better price.*

*Technique #43 Bluffing for Bargains The haggling skills used in ancient Arab markets are alive and well in contemporary America for big-ticket items. Your price is much lower when you know how to deal. Before every big purchase, find several vendors—a few to learn from and one to buy from. Armed with a few words of industryese, you’re ready to head for the store where you’re going to buy. Soon you’ll be asking furriers where the skins were dressed, moving companies for their ICC performance record, and lawyers the hourly rate of paralegals and associates. Then these folks, like Iggy the painter, will say to themselves, “Hey, dis is no babe in the woods—I better deal straight.”*

*You’ll never see a barn swallow with a bank swallow, or even a yellow bird hanging out with a yellow finch. Somebody said it shorter: Birds of a feather flock together. Happily, humans are smarter than birds. In one respect, at least: we have brains capable of overcoming bias. Really smart human beings work together, play together, and break bread together. Does that mean their comfort level is high? Well, that depends on the human being. Our purpose here is not to exam- ine the absurdity of apartheid. It is to leave no stone unturned in making sure people are completely comfortable doing business or pleasure with you. It has been proven beyond a doubt, people are most recep- tive to those they feel have the same values in life. In one study, 171 Copyright 2003 by Leil Lowndes. Click Here for Terms of Use. 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 172 172 How to Talk to Anyone individuals were first given a personality and beliefs test.20 They were then paired off with a partner and told to go spend time together. Before meeting, half the couples were told they were very similar in beliefs to their partner. The other half were told they were dissimilar. Neither statement was true.*

*Technique #44 Be a Copycl ass Watch people. Look at the way they move. Small movements? Big movements? Fast? Slow? Jerky? Fluid? Old? Young? Classy? Trashy? Pretend the person you are talking to is your dance instructor. Is he a jazzy mover? Is she a balletic mover? Watch his or her body, then imitate the style of movement. That makes your conversation partner subliminally real comfy with you.*

*Match your personality to your product. Selling handmade suits? A little decorum please. Selling jeans? A little cool, please. Selling sweat suits? A little sporty, please. And so on for whatever you’re selling. Remember, you are your customers’ buying experi- ence. Therefore you are part of the product they’re buying.*

*We grew older. We moved away. Our backgrounds, our experiences, our goals, our lifestyles became diverse. Thus, we fell off each other’s wavelengths. Wouldn’t it be great to have a magic surfboard to help you hop right back on everybody’s wavelength whenever you wanted? Here it is, a linguistic device that gets you riding on high rapport with everyone you meet. If you stand on a mountain cliff and shout “hello-oh” across the valley, your identical “hello-oh” thun- ders back at you. I call the technique “Echoing” because, like the mountain, you echo your conversation partner’s precise words.*  

- Page 192 (location ~ 2936-2942)    

*The Linguistic Device That Says “We’re on the Same Wavelength” When you want to give someone the subliminal feeling you’re just alike, use their words, not yours. Suppose you are selling a car to a young mother who tells you she is concerned about safety because she has a young “toddler.” When explaining the safety fea- 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 178 178 How to Talk to Anyone tures of the car, use her word. Don’t use whatever word you call your kids. Don’t even say child-protection lock, which was in your sales manual. Tell your prospect, “No toddler can open the win- dow because of the driver’s control device.” Even call it a toddler- protection lock. When Mom hears toddler coming from your lips, she feels you are “family” because that’s how all her relatives refer to her little tyke. Suppose your prospect had said kid or infant. Fine, echo any word she used. (Well, almost any word. If she’d said my brat, you might want to pass on Echoing this time.)*  

- Page 193 (location ~ 2959-2969)    

*Echoing at Parties Let’s say you are at a party. It’s a huge bash with many different types of people. You are first chatting with a lawyer who tells you her profession is often maligned. When it comes your turn to speak, say profession too. If you say job, it puts a subconscious barrier between you. Next you meet a construction worker who starts talking about his job. Now you’re in trouble if you say, “Well, in my profession . . .” he’d think you were being hoity-toity. After the lawyer and the construction worker, you talk to sev- eral freelancers—first a model, then a professional speaker, finally a pop musician. All three of these folks will use different words for their work. The model brags about her bookings. The professional speaker might say bookings, but he is more apt to boast of his speak- ing engagements. A pop musician might say, “Yeah, man, I get a lot of gigs.” It’s tough to memorize what they all call their work. Just keep your ears open and echo their word after they say it. Echoing goes beyond job names. For example if you are chat- ting with a boat owner and you call his boat an it, he labels you a real landlubber. (He reverently refers to his beloved boat, of course, as a she.) If you listen carefully, you hear language sub- tleties you never dreamed existed. Would you believe using the wrong synonym for a seemingly uncomplicated word like have 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 179 How to Make Them Feel That You’re Like “Family” 179 labels you a know-nothing in somebody else’s world? For exam- ple, cat lovers purr about having cats. But horse people would say owning horses. And fish folk don’t own fish. They talk about keep- ing fish. Hey, no big deal. But if you use the wrong word, your conversation partner will assume, correctly, that you are a stranger in his or her hobbyland.*  

- Page 194 (location ~ 2970-2990)    

*Echoing Is Politically Correct Insurance Here’s a quiz: You’re talking with a pharmacist and you ask her, “How long have you worked at the drugstore?” What’s wrong with that question? Give up? It’s the word drugstore. Pharmacists abhor the word because it conjures up many industry problems. They’re used to hearing it from outsiders, but it’s a tip-off that they are unaware of, or insensitive to, their professional problems. They prefer pharmacy.*  

- Page 197 (location ~ 3016-3021)    

*A group’s intense preference for one word is not arbitrary. Cer- tain jobs, minorities, and special-interest groups often have a his- tory the public is not sensitive to. When that history has too much pain attached to it, people invent another word that doesn’t have bitter connotations.*  

- Page 198 (location ~ 3026-3029)    

*On-Target Analogies Hit Bull’s-Eye Analogies can be an effective communications tool—if you evoke images from the life of the person you are talking to. Men don’t use football analogies to obfuscate matters or to confuse women but to clarify situations for each other. Analogies from the sport bring situations to life for men because generally they watch more football than women. Moving on to other sports analogies: everyone knows what the speaker means when he or she hears, “We’ll never strike out 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 184 184 How to Talk to Anyone with this solution.” Nevertheless, the image would be more com- pelling to a baseball fan as would analogies like “caught on the fly,” “hitting the dirt,” “or throwing a spit ball.”*

*Technique #46 Potent Imaging Does your customer have a garden? Talk about “sowing the seeds for success.” Does your boss own a boat? Tell him or her about a concept that will “hold water” or “stay afloat.” Maybe he is a private pilot? Talk about a concept really “taking off.” She plays tennis? Tell her it really hits the “sweet spot.” Evoke your listener’s interests or lifestyle and weave images around it. To give your points more power and punch, use analogies from your listener’s world, not your own. Potent Imaging also tells your listeners you think like them and hints you share their interests.*

*What Are Empathizers? Empathizers are simple, short, supportive statements. Unlike “uh huh,” they are complete sentences such as “I can appreciate you decided to do that,” or “That really is exciting.” Empathizers can be one-sentence positive critiques like “Yes, that was the honor- able thing to do,” or “It’s charming you felt that way.” When you respond with complete sentences instead of the usual grunts, not only do you come across as more articulate, but your listener feels that you really understand.*

*Technique #47 Employ Empathizers Don’t be an unconscious ummer. Vocalize complete sentences to show your understanding. Dust your dialogue with phrases like “I see what you mean.” Sprinkle it with sentimental sparklers like “That’s a lovely thing to say.” Your empathy impresses your listeners and encourages them to continue. Of course, you pay a price. To use the right empathizers, you do need to listen. Now let’s fine-tune this technique and explore advanced empathizing.*  

- Page 204 (location ~ 3114-3120)    

*So I started listening very carefully to all my friends to dis- cover which was their primary perception. Sometimes I’d hear visual references like “I see what you mean.” “That looks good to me.” “I can’t picture myself doing that.” “I take a dim view of that idea.” “From my perspective . . .” Wow, I thought I was really on to something!*  

- Page 206 (location ~ 3144-3148)    

*A Simple Solution Here’s what I’ve found does work, and it doesn’t take too much detective work on your part. I call the technique “Anatomically Correct Empathizers,” and it’s easy to master. Unless it is obvious the person you are speaking with is primarily visual, auditory, or kinesthetic, simply respond in his or her mode of the moment. Match your empathizers to the current sense someone is talking through. For example, suppose a business colleague describing a financial plan says, “With this plan, we can see our way clear in six months.” Since this time she’s using primarily visual references, 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 191 How to Make Them Think You See/Hear/Feel It Just the Way They Do 191 say “I see what you mean” or “You really have a clear picture of that situation.” If, instead, your colleague had said, “This plan has a good ring to it,” you’d substitute auditory empathizers like “It does sound great,” or “I hear you.” A third possibility. Suppose she had said, “I have a gut feeling this plan will work.” Now you give her a kinesthetic empathizer like “I can understand how you feel,” or “You have a good grasp of that problem.”*

*Technique #48 Anatomic ally Correc t Empathizers What part of their anatomy are your associates talking through? Their eyes? Their ears? Their gut? For visual people, use visual empathizers to make them think you see the world the way they do. For auditory folks, use auditory empathizers to make them think you hear them loud and clear. For kinesthetic types, use kinesthetic empathizers to make them think you feel the same way they do. What about the other two senses, taste and smell? Well, I’ve never run up against any gustatory or olfactory types. But you could always compliment a chef by saying, “That’s a delicious idea.” And if you are talking to your dog (olfactory, of course), tell him “The whole idea stinks.” The next technique helps create affinity with a single word.*

*Level Three: Feelings and Personal Questions When people become friends, they often express their feelings to each other, even on subjects as dull as the weather. “George, I just love these sunny days.” They also ask each other personal ques- tions: “How about you, Betty? Are you a sun person?” Level Four: We Statements Now we progress to the highest level of intimacy. This level is richer than facts and creates more rapport than feelings. It’s we and us statements. Friends discussing the weather might say, “If we keep having this good weather, it’ll be a great summer.” Lovers might say, “I hope this good weather keeps up for us so we can go swimming on our trip.” A technique to achieve the ultimate verbal intimacy grows out of this phenomenon. Simply use the word we prematurely. You can use it to make a client, a prospect, a stranger feel you are already friends. Use it to make a potential romantic partner feel the two of you are already an item. I call it the “Premature We.” In casual conversation, simply cut through levels one and two. Jump straight to three and four. Ask your prospect’s feelings on something the way you would query a friend. (“George, how do you feel about the new gover- nor?”) Then use the pronoun we when discussing anything that might affect the two of you. (“Do you think we’re going to pros- 05 (171-198B) part five 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 194 194 How to Talk to Anyone per during his administration?”) Make it a point to concoct we sentences, the kind people instinctively reserve for friends, lovers, and other intimates. (“I think we’ll survive while the governor’s in office.”) The word*

*Technique #49 The Premature WE Create the sensation of intimacy with someone even if you’ve met just moments before. Scramble the signals in their psyche by skipping conversational levels one and two and cutting right to levels three and four. Elicit intimate feelings by using the magic words we, us, and our.*

*Technique #50 Instant History When you meet a stranger you’d like to make less a stranger, search for some special moment you shared during your first encounter. Then find a few words that reprieve the laugh, the warm smile, the good feelings the two of you felt. Now, just like old friends, you have a history together, an Instant History. With anyone you’d like to make part of your personal or professional future, look for special moments together. Then make them a refrain.*

*Now What’s Left? Chemistry, charisma, and confidence are three characteristics shared by big winners in all walks of life. Part One helped us make a dynamic, confident, and charismatic first impression with body language. In Part Two, we put smooth small-talk lyrics to our body ballet. Then in Part Three, we seized hints from the big boys and big girls so we’re contenders for life’s big league. Part Four rescued us from being tongue-tied with folks with whom we have very lit- tle in common. And in Part Five, we learned techniques to create instant chemistry, instant intimacy, instant rapport. What’s left? You guessed it—making people feel really good about themselves. But compliments are a dangerous weapon in today’s world. One mishandling and you can butcher the rela- tionship. Let us now explore the power of praise, the folly of flat- tery, and how you can use these potent tools effectively.*  

- Page 214 (location ~ 3272-3281)    

*What is the difference between praise that lifts and flattery that flattens? Many factors enter the equation. They include your sincerity, timing, motivation, and wording. They also involve the recipient’s self-image, professional position, experience with com- pliments, and judgment of your powers of perception. Of course it entails the relationship between the two of you and how long you have known each other. If you’re complimenting someone by phone, E-mail, or snail mail, it even involves subtleties such as whether you’ve ever seen his or face, either in person or a photograph. Mind boggling, isn’t it? Sociologists’ research shows: 1) a com- pliment from a new person is more potent than from someone you already know, 2) your compliment has more credibility when given to an unattractive person or an attractive person whose face you’ve never seen, 3) you are taken more seriously if you preface your comments by some self-effacing remark—but only if your listener perceives you as higher on the totem pole. If you’re lower, your 06 (199-228B) part six 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 201 How to Differen tiate the Power of Praise from the Folly of Flattery 201 self-effacing remark reduces your credibility. Complicated, this complimenting stuff.*  

- Page 216 (location ~ 3304-3317)    

*No-Risk Praise (Do It Behind Their Back) Instead of telling someone directly of your admiration, tell some- one who is close to the person you wish to compliment. For instance, suppose you want to be in the good graces of Jane Smith. Don’t directly compliment Jane. Go to her close associate Diane Doe and say, “You know, Jane is a very dynamic woman. She said something so brilliant in the meeting the other day. Someday she’ll be running this company.” I place ten-to-one odds your comment will get back to Jane via the grapevine in twenty-four hours. Diane will tell her friend, “You should hear what so ’n’ so said about you the other day.”*  

- Page 218 (location ~ 3338-3344)    

*Technique #51 Grape vine Glory A compliment one hears is never as exciting as the one he overhears. A priceless way to praise is not by telephone, not by telegraph, but by tell-a-friend. This way you escape possible suspicion that you are an apple-polishing, bootlicking, egg-sucking, back- scratching sycophant trying to win brownie points. You also leave recipients with the happy fantasy that you are telling the whole world about their greatness. When you gave Grapevine Glory to Jane, Diane became the carrier pigeon of that compliment. Which leads us to the next technique where you become the carrier pigeon of other people’s compliments.*  

- Page 219 (location ~ 3344-3351)    

*Whenever you hear a laudatory comment about someone, don’t let it end there. You don’t need to write it, roll it up in a cap- sule, strap it to your leg like Stumpy Joe, and fly it to the recipi- ent. Nevertheless, you can remember the kudo and verbally carry it to the person who will get the most pleasure—the person who was complimented.*  

- Page 220 (location ~ 3363-3366)    

*Technique #52 Carrier Pigeon Kudos People immediately grow a beak and metamorphosize themselves into carrier pigeons when there’s bad news. (It’s called gossip.) Instead, become a carrier of good news and kudos. Whenever you hear something complimentary about someone, fly to them with the compliment. Your fans may not posthumously stuff you and put you on display in a museum like Stumpy Joe. But everyone loves the carrier pigeon of kind thoughts. Carry More Cargo than Compliments Another way to warm hearts and win friends is to become a car- rier pigeon of news items that might interest the recipient. Call, mail, or E-mail people with information they might find interest- 06 (199-228B) part six 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 206 206 How to Talk to Anyone ing.*

*Here’s yet another caress for someone’s ego. Don’t give a blatant compliment. Merely imply something magnificent about your con- versation partner. Several months ago, I was visiting an old friend in Denver whom I hadn’t seen in a long time. When he came to my hotel to pick me up, he said, “Hello, Leil, how are you?” Then he paused, looked at me, and said, “You’ve obviously been well.”*  

- Page 222 (location ~ 3394-3397)    

*Technique #53 Implie d Magnific enc e Throw a few comments into your conversation that presuppose something positive about the person you’re talking with. But be careful. Don’t blow it like the well- intentioned maintenance man. Or the southern boy who, at the prom, thought he was flattering his date when he told her, “Gosh, Mary Lou, for a fat gal you dance real good.”*  

- Page 223 (location ~ 3412-3417)    

*Try It. You’ll Like It. They’ll Love It. Try Accidental Adulation and see smiles break out on the faces of the recipients. Tell your sixty-five-year-old uncle, “Anyone as fit as you would have zipped right up those steps, but boy, was I out of breath.” Tell a colleague: “Because you’re so knowledgeable in contract law, you would have read between the lines, but stupidly, I signed it.” You run the danger, of course, that you will please the recip- ient so profoundly with your parenthetical praise, he or she won’t hear your main point.*  

- Page 224 (location ~ 3433-3439)    

*Technique #54 Accidental Adul ation Become an undercover complimenter. Stealthily sneak praise into the parenthetical part of your sentence. Just don’t try to quiz anyone later on your main point. The joyful jolt of your accidental adulation strikes them temporarily deaf to anything that follows. So far we have explored four covert compliments: Grapevine Glory, Carrier Pigeon Kudos, Implied Magnificence, and Acci- dental Adulation. There are times, of course, when blatant praise does work. The next techniques will hone your skills in this pre- carious but rewarding venture.*

*What is the Killer Compliment? It is commenting on some very personal and specific quality you spot in someone. A Killer Compliment is not “I like your tie” or “You’re a very nice person.” (The first is not personal enough and the second is not specific enough.) A Killer Compliment is more like “What exquisite eyes you have,” (very specific) or “You have a wonderful air of honesty about you,” (very personal). Because delivering your first Killer Compliment is difficult, I trick my seminar participants into pulling it off. About midway through the program, I’ll ask them to close their eyes and think about a partner they had in an earlier exercise. Then I say, “Now recall one attractive physical quality or personality trait you observed in your partner. Not one you would necessarily comment on,” I caution. “Perhaps your partner had a lovely smile or a twin- kle in her eye. Perhaps he exuded a sense of calm or credibility. Got it in your mind?”*  

- Page 226 (location ~ 3463-3473)    

*Technique #55 Killer Compliment Whenever you are talking with a stranger you’d like to make part of your professional or personal future, search for one attractive, specific, and unique quality he or she has. At the end of the conversation, look the individual right in the eye. Say his or her name and proceed to curl all ten toes with the Killer Compliment. Rule #1: Deliver your Killer Compliment to the recipi- ent in private. If you are standing with a group of four or five people and you praise one woman for being fit, every other woman feels like a barrel of lard. If you tell one man he has wonderful carriage, every other feels like a hunchback. You also make the blushing recipient uncomfortable. Rule #2: Make your Killer Compliment credible. For example, I’m tone-deaf. If I’m forced to sing even a simple song like “Happy Birthday,” I sound like a sick pig. If anyone in earshot were foolish enough to tell me they liked my voice, I’d know it was hogwash. Rule #3: Confer only one Killer Compliment per half year on each recipient. Otherwise you come across as insincere, groveling, obsequious, pandering, and a thoroughly manipulative person. Not cool. With careful aim, the Killer Compliment captures everyone. It works best, however, when you use it judiciously on new acquaintances. If you want to praise friends every day, employ the next technique.*  

- Page 228 (location ~ 3482-3497)    

*Technique #56 Lit tle Strokes Don’t make your colleagues, your friends, your loved ones look at you and silently say, “Haven’t I been pretty good today?” Let them know how much you appreciate them by caressing them with verbal Little Strokes like “Nice job!” “Well done!” “Cool!” Little Things Mean a Lot Little Strokes are indeed, little. But as every woman knows, they mean a lot. I’ve yet to meet a woman who wouldn’t agree with these lyrics from an old song sung by Kitty Kallen: Blow me a kiss from across the room. Say I look nice when I’m not. Touch my hair as you pass my chair.*

*Quick as a Hiccup, You Must Compliment NOW When the doctor sadistically smacks your knee with that nasty lit- tle rubber hammer, you instantly give a knee jerk. And when peo- ple make a coup, you must instantly hit them with a knee-jerk “Wow, you were great!” Say they’ve just successfully negotiated a deal, cooked a ter- rific Thanksgiving turkey, or sung a solo song at the birthday party. No matter whether their accomplishment is trivial or triumphant, you must praise it immediately—not ten minutes later, not two minutes later—immediately. The moment the winner walks out of the boardroom, the kitchen, the spotlight, the victor wants to hear only one sound: “WOW!”*  

- Page 232 (location ~ 3551-3558)    

*Technique #57 The Knee-Jerk “ Wow!” Quick as a blink, you must praise people the moment they a finish a feat. In a wink, like a knee-jerk reaction say, “You were terrific!” Don’t worry that they won’t believe you. The euphoria of the moment has a strangely numbing effect on the achiever’s objective judgment.*

*We have a national weakness: we don’t know how to receive a compliment! In fact, I would like to dedicate the following tech- nique to my French friends who contend the French are better at everything. Well, I concede one point. The French are, indeed, better at receiving compliments. I’ll explain how shortly. Americans, unfortunately, are beastly at accepting adulation. If someone compliments you and you react clumsily out of embar- rassment, you unwittingly start a vicious cycle. A friend ventures a compliment: He: (smiling) “Hey, that’s a nice dress you’re wearing.” She: (frowning) “Oh, this old thing?” He: (thinking) “Whoops, she didn’t seem to like hearing that. She thinks I have terrible taste to like that dress. I’d better keep my mouth shut.” Three weeks later . . . She: (thinking grumpily) “He doesn’t ever give me compli- ments anymore. What a boor!” He: (thinking gloomily) “What’s her problem?”*  

- Page 233 (location ~ 3572-3582)    

*“Vous Êtes Gentil” Leave it to French folks to come up with a congenial catchall phrase. Upon receiving a compliment, they say, “Vous êtes gentil.” Loosely translated, that is “How kind of you.” An American saying “How kind of you” could sound stilted— like the little flower girl in My Fair Lady trying to be cultured. Nevertheless, we Yanks can express the French gentil sentiment with a technique I call “Boomeranging.” When you toss a boomerang, it makes an almost 180-degree swerve in midair and soars back to land at the feet of the thrower. Likewise, when someone tosses a compliment your way, let the good feelings soar back to the tosser. Don’t just say “Thanks.” (Or worse, “Oh it’s nothing.”) Let them know of your gratitude and find a way to compliment them for their compliment.*  

- Page 235 (location ~ 3593-3602)    

*Technique #58 Boomeranging Just as a boomerang flies right back to the thrower, let compliments boomerang right back to the giver. Like the French, quickly murmur something that expresses “That’s very kind of you.”*  

- Page 236 (location ~ 3612-3615)    

*Step one: In a quiet moment chatting with your friend, your loved one, or your business partner, tell him or her that the other day you were reading about—of all things—tombstones! “The piece was about,” you say, “what people fantasize will be inscribed above their grave after they die.” You learned that people want the quality they are most proud of in life etched in stone. Then say, “The variety is surprising. Everyone has a different self-image, a different deep source of pride.” Examples: Here lies John Doe. He was a brilliant scientist. Here lies Diane Smith. She was a caring woman. Here lies Billy Bucks. By golly, he could make people laugh. Here lies Jane Wilson. She spread joy wherever she went. Here lies Harry Jones. He lived life his way. Step two: Reveal to your partner what you would like carved on your tombstone. Be serious about your revelation to encourage him or her to do likewise. Step three: Now, you pop the question, “You know, Joe, when all is said and done, what are you most proud of ? What would you like the world to most remember about you? What would you want the world to see carved on your tombstone?” Perhaps your business partner Joe says, “Well, I guess I’d sort of like people to know that I’m a man of my word.” Listen care- fully. If he expounds on it, take note of every nuance. Then file it away in your heart and don’t say a word about it again. Joe will forget you ever played The Tombstone Game with him. Step four: Let at least three weeks pass. Then, whenever you want to improve the relationship, feed the information back to your partner in the form of a compliment. Say “Joe, you know the reason I really appreciate being in business with you is because you’re a man of your word.”*  

- Page 238 (location ~ 3643-3661)    

*“I Love You Because . . . ” (You Fill in the Blank) Suppose your significant other is Jane Wilson in the preceding example. Tell your beloved, “Jane, I love you because you spread joy wherever you go.” Suppose your life partner is Harry Jones. You take his hand and say, “Harry, I love you because you live life your way.” BLAM! You have found that tender spot where the heart and the ego blend.*

*Technique #59 The Tombstone Game Ask the important people in your life what they would like engraved on their tombstone. Chisel it into your memory but don’t mention it again. Then, when the moment is right to say “I appreciate you” or “I love you,” fill the blanks with the very words they gave you weeks earlier. You take people’s breath away when you feed their deepest self-image to them in a compliment. “At last,” they say to themselves, “someone who loves me for who I truly am.” 06 (199-228B) part six 8/14/03 9:18 AM Page 227 How to Make a Loved One Feel You Are THE Partner for Life 227 The Tombstone Game compliments are not interchangeable. Billy Bucks might not appreciate your calling him a man of his word; Billy’s thing is humor. Jane might not value your thinking she lives life her way. Her source of pride is spreading joy wher- ever she goes. It’s wonderful to tell people you appreciate or love them. When it matches what they appreciate or love about themselves, the effect is overpowering.*

*Technique #60 Talking Gestures Think of yourself as the star of a personal radio drama every time you pick up the phone. If you want to come across as engaging as you are, you must turn your smiles into sound, your nods into noise, and all your gestures into something your listener can hear. You must replace your gestures with talk. Then punch up the whole act 30 percent!*

*How can you create closeness when the two of you are hundreds of miles apart? How can you make the person you’re talking to on the phone feel special when you can’t pat their back or give them a little hug? The answer is simple. Just use your caller’s name far more often than you would in person. In fact, shower your conversa- tions with his or her name. When your listener hears it, it’s like receiving a verbal caress: “Thanks, Sam.” “Let’s do it, Betty.” “Hey, Demetri, why not?” “It’s really been good talking to you, Kathi.” Saying a person’s name too often in face-to-face conversation sounds manipulative. However, on the phone the effect is dra- matically different. If you heard someone say your name, even if you were being jostled around in a big noisy crowd, you’d perk up 234 Copyright 2003 by Leil Lowndes.

- Page 246 (location ~ 3761-3773)    

*Technique #61 Name Shower People perk up when they hear their own name. Use it more often on the phone than you would in person to keep their attention. Your caller’s name re-creates the eye contact, the caress, you might give in person. Saying someone’s name repeatedly when face-to-face sounds pandering. But because there is physical distance between you on the phone—sometimes you’re a conti- nent apart—you can spray your conversation with it.*  

- Page 247 (location ~ 3777-3782)    

*Technique #62 “Oh Wow, It’s You!” Don’t answer the phone with an “I’m just sooo happy all the time” attitude. Answer warmly, crisply, and professionally. Then, after you hear who is calling, let a huge smile of happiness engulf your entire face and spill over into your voice. You make your caller feel as though your giant warm fuzzy smile is reserved for him or her.*

*Technique #63 The Sne aky Screen If you must screen your calls, instruct your staff to first say cheerfully, “Oh yes, I’ll put you right through. May I tell her who’s calling?” If the party has already identified himself, it’s “Oh of course, Mr. Whoozit. I’ll put you right through.” When the secretary comes back with the bad news that Mr. or Ms. Bigwig is unavailable, callers don’t take it personally and never feel screened. They fall for it every time, just like I did.*

*Technique #64 Salute the Spouse Whenever you are calling someone’s home, always identify and greet the person who answers. Whenever you call someone’s office more than once or twice, make friends with the secretary. Anybody who is close enough to answer the phone is close enough to sway the VIP’s opinion of you. A surprising number of Big Cat spouses—and secretaries— have deep claws into important business decisions.

*Whenever you place a call, always—not occasionally, not fre- quently—always ask about your timing. Make it a habit. Make it a rule. Make it a self-punishable crime if the first words out of your mouth don’t concern the convenience of your timing: “Hi, Joe, is this a good time to talk?” “Hello, Susan. Have you got a minute?” “Hi, Carl, did I catch you good or did I catch you bad?” “Sam, do you have a second for me to tell you about what happened at the game last Saturday?” There are many ways to say it, but it all boils down to “Is this a good time to talk?”*

*My friend Barry, a broadcaster, accomplishes more in a day than most people do in a week. He came up with a clever con- versational device that ensures he’ll never shatter anyone’s emo- tional sundial. He calls it “What Color Is Your Time?” Barry introduces the device by telling people he’s calling he has great respect for their time. He then asks permission to start his future conversations with a question that assures he’ll never disturb them at an inopportune moment. Barry says he’s going to ask what color their time is. They should honestly answer, “red,” “yellow,” or “green.” Red means “I’m really rushed.” Yellow means “I’m busy but what’s on your mind? If it’s quick, we can deal with it.” Green means “Sure, I’ve got time. Let’s talk.” Red, like the stoplight at the corner, means stop.*

*Salesfolks, Wait for the Green Light A note here for salespeople. If you ask a prospect if he or she has time to talk and the answer is “Not really, but tell me what’s on your mind,” DON’T! Do not make your sales pitch while he or she is red. Do not talk when he or she is yellow. Wait until green, very green. (If you ever want to see any green coming from your prospect, that is.)*  

- Page 259 (location ~ 3959-3963)    

*Technique #65 What Color Is Your Time? No matter how urgent you think your call, always begin by asking the person about timing. Either use the What Color Is Your Time? device or simply ask, “Is this a convenient time for you to talk?” When you ask about timing first, you’ll never smash your footprints right in the middle of your telephone partner’s sands of time. You’ll never get a “No!” just because your timing wasn’t right.*

*The message you leave on your answering machine reflects your work. Keep yours friendly, neutral, and up-to-date. And here’s the secret: to give the impression you are really on top of your business, change your message every day. Studies show that callers perceive people to be brighter and more efficient when they hear an updated message each time they call. If appropriate, let callers know where you are and when you intend to be back. If you have customers who need to be attended to, this is crucial. Try something like this on your office phone: “This is (name). It’s Thursday, May 7, and I’ll be in a sales meeting until late this afternoon. Please leave your message and I’ll get back to you as soon as I return.” That way, if you don’t call a client back until 4 p.m. he isn’t steaming.*

*One last codicil: Avoid one particular message many busi- nesspeople use these days—“I’m either away from my desk or on the other line.” The subtext of this message is “I’m a slave chained to my desk and it is an amazing fact that I have escaped for the moment.” One night I was working into the wee hours. At 4 a.m. I decided to leave a message on a colleague’s business phone so she’d get it as soon as she came in at nine. “Hello,” the message 07 (229-264B) part seven 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 251 How to Impress Everyone with Your Outgoing Voicemail Message 251 chirped. “This is Felicia. I’m either away from my desk or on the other line right now, but leave your message at the tone.” Beep. Felicia, of course you’re away from your desk—it’s 4 a.m. on Sun- day morning! “On the other line?” At this hour? I hope not! You never know how your message is going to affect some- one. Just keep yours neutral, friendly, constantly changing, short, and understated. No boasts, no bells, no whistles.*

*Technique #66 Constantly Changing Outgoing Message If you want to be perceived as conscientious and reliable, leave a short, professional, and friendly greeting as your outgoing message. No music. No jokes. No inspirational messages. No boasts, bells, or whistles. And here’s the secret: change it every day. Your message doesn’t have to be flawless. A little cough or stammer gives a lovely unpretentious reality to your message.*

*Technique #67 Your Ten-Second Audition While dialing, clear your throat. If an answering machine picks up, pretend the beep is a big Broadway producer saying “Nexxxt.” Now you’re on. This is Your Ten-Second Audition to prove you are worthy of a quick callback.*  

- Page 266 (location ~ 4065-4068)    

*Incidentally, if someone’s voice mail unexpectedly comes on and you are unprepared, quickly hang up (before the beep so they don’t get a hang-up message.) Take a moment to craft your enter- taining, enticing, or interesting message. Rehearse it once with confidence, clarity, and charisma. Then redial to leave your great hot message. A funny thing happens. If your party answers this time, you’ll be disappointed.*  

- Page 266 (location ~ 4070-4074)    

*I dubbed this deception “The Ho-Hum Caper” after my feigned attitude of “Ho hum, business as usual. I come here every day with nothing on my mind but lunch.” Let us now translate that sneaky subterfuge into a seldom- fail phone technique. You can use the maneuver to sneak around secretaries and dodge their heartless screening. Instead of play- ing it straight and asking for your party by name, just say “Is he in?” or “Is she in?” Using the pronoun is verbally sprinting past the secretary with a business as usual, “Ho hum, I call every day” attitude.*  

- Page 267 (location ~ 4091-4097)    

*Technique #68 The Ho-Hum Caper Instead of using your party’s name, casually let the pronoun he or she roll off your tongue. Forget “Uh, may I speak to Ms. Bigshot please?” Just announce, “Hi, Bob Smith here, is she in?” Tossing the familiar she off your tongue signals to the secretary that you and her boss are old buddies.*  

- Page 268 (location ~ 4097-4101)    

*Technique #69 “I He ar Your Other Line” When you hear a phone in the background, stop speaking—in midsentence, if necessary—and say “I hear your other line,” (or your dog barking, your baby crying, your spouse calling you). Ask whether she has to attend to it. Whether she does or not, she’ll know you’re a top communicator for asking. And don’t forget foreign holidays. Last July 1, I was on the phone with a client from Australia. I was impressed when he wished me “Happy Independence Day weekend.” So impressed, in fact, I ran out to find a chart of international holidays. I made a note in my calendar next January 26 to wish my Aussie friend “Happy Australia Day.” If you do business with people around the world, be sure to extend good wishes to them for their holidays. Forget about your own if they’re not shared. I’m still mortified about the time last November when I was on a conference call with a Canadian client and seven of his salespeople. I wished them all “Happy Thanksgiving.”*

*Technique #70 Instant Repl ay Record all your business conversations and listen to them again. The second or third time, you pick up on significant subtleties you missed the first time. It’s like football fans who often don’t know if there was a fumble until they see it all over again in Instant Replay. Forget What They Said, Hear What They Meant Instant Replay also makes you sensitive to levels of communica- tion far deeper than just your callers’ words. You tune in to their real enthusiasm or hesitation about an idea. When we want something, our minds play funny tricks on us. If we desperately crave “yes” from someone, we hear “yes.” But “yes” isn’t always what it seems. A client’s forceful “YES” and her hesitant “yeee-sss” are different as heaven and hell. Last month I asked a woman who’d booked me for a speech if her office could reproduce my ten-page handout. She gave me the answer I wanted, which was “yes.”*  

- Page 274 (location ~ 4195-4205)    

*More specifically, who will be there that I should meet? Serious networkers calculate “Who must I meet for business? Who should I meet for political or social reasons?” And, if single and search- ing, “Who do I want to meet for possible love?” If they don’t know who is going to be in attendance, they ask. Politicians unabashedly telephone the host or hostess of the party and ask, “Who’s coming?” As the party giver chats casually about the guest list, politicians scribble the names of the people who interest them, then resolve to meet each.*  

- Page 276 (location ~ 4227-4232)    

*When Should I Arrive? Politicians do not leave arrival time to whenever they finish get- ting dressed. They don’t ask themselves, “Hmm, should I be fash- ionably late?” They carefully calculate their estimated time of arrival and estimated time of departure. If the party is bulging with contacts, biggies get there early to start hitting their marks as each arrives. VIPs frequently come early to get their business done before party regulars who “hate to be the first one there” start arriving. They are never embarrassed to arrive early. After all, the only people who see them are other early arrivals who are often heavy hitters like themselves. Nor will you find politicians prowling around, the last to slink out the door. Once they’ve accomplished what they set out to do, they’re on their way to the next opportunity. If their agenda is more social, they try to leave their departure time open and their aprés-party schedule free.*  

- Page 276 (location ~ 4232-4242)    

*What Should I Take with Me? A politician’s checklist is not the usual, “Let’s see, my comb, cologne, and breath mints.” They pack more functional network- ing tools in their pockets or purses. If corporate cats will be prowling the party, they pack a pock- etful of business cards. If it’s a gala where people are gadding about on the social ladder and they want to exude old-world elegance, they grab a handful of social cards containing only their name and possibly an address and phone number. (Some feel giving out a business card in a purely social setting can be gauche.) The most vital tool in their party pack is a small pad and pen to keep track of important contacts.*  

- Page 277 (location ~ 4245-4252)    

*Where Is the Collective Mind? Often people from one profession or one interest group will com- prise most of the guest list. A politician never accepts any invita- tion without asking herself, “What kind of people will be at this party, and what will they be thinking about?” Perhaps there will be a drove of doctors. So she clicks on the latest medical headlines and rehearses a little doc-talk. If the guests are a nest of new-age voters, the politician gets up to speed on telepathic healing, Tantric toning, and trance dancing. Politicians can’t afford to not be in the know.*  

- Page 279 (location ~ 4270-4275)    

*How Am I Going to Follow Up on the Party? Now, the big finale. I call it “Contact Cement.” It’s cementing the contacts the politician has made. After meeting a good contact and exchanging cards, practically everyone says, “It’s been great talking to you. We’ll stay in touch.” This good intention seldom happens without herculean effort. Politicians, however, make a science out of keeping up the con- tact. After the party, they sit at their desks and, like a game of soli- taire, lay out the business cards of the people they’ve met. Using 08 (265-292) part eight 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 269 How to Work a Party Like a Politician Works a Room 269 “The Business Card Dossier” technique described later in this sec- tion, they decide how, when, and if to deal with each. Does this person require a phone call? Should that one receive a handwrit- ten note? Shall I E-mail or call the other one? Use the Six-Point Party Checklist—the Who? When? Why? Where? What? and How? of a party—as your general game plan. Now let’s get down to specifics.*

*Chewing the nibbles on his plate and the fat with his friends, he occasionally looks around the room to see who might be new and fun to talk to. He’s hoping several attractive and interesting people at the party will spot him and come over to talk. What’s wrong with Charlie’s approach? Everything, if Char- lie wants to make the party productive. Let’s start with the aver- age party goer’s first mistake—getting some refreshments and a drink right off the bat. People mingling at a party make judgments, often subcon- scious, about whom they are going to approach. Have you ever lived on a farm? Or had a dog or a cat? Then you know you never disturb animals when they are eating.*  

- Page 280 (location ~ 4291-4297)    

*Technique #71 Munching or Mingling Politicians want to be eyeball to eyeball and belly to belly with their constituents. Like any big winner well versed in the science of proxemics and spatial relationships, they know any object except their belt buckle has the effect of a brick wall between two people. Therefore they never hold food or drink at a party. Come to munch or come to mingle. But do not expect to do both. Like a good politician, chow down before you come.*  

- Page 281 (location ~ 4306-4312)    

*Politicians don’t just slink unnoticed into a roomful of people. Politicians make The Entrance. With one simple technique, you too can make great entrances. I call it “Rubberneck the Room.” Before entering, stop dramatically in the doorway and survey the scene s-l-o-w-l-y with your eyes. It is significant that, while you’re standing in the doorway, you’re not thinking, “Look at me.” The reason you’re Rubbernecking the Room is not to show off. It is so you can diagnose the situation you’re walking into. Take note of the lighting, the bar, and most important, the faces. Listen to the music, the buzz of the crowd, the clinking of glasses. See who is talking to whom. While rubber- necking, you’ll also be using “Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee,” the next technique, which helps you select your first, second, and maybe third target. Now, like the big cat who rules the jungle, leap in to make your first move toward wiping up the room.*  

- Page 283 (location ~ 4330-4339)    

*Technique #72 Rubberneck the Room When you arrive at the gathering, stop dramatically in the doorway. Then s-l-o-w-l-y survey the situation. Let your eyes travel back and forth like a SWAT team ready in a heartbeat to wipe out anything that moves. In tandem with Rubberneck the Room, try using the follow- ing technique.*  

- Page 283 (location ~ 4339-4343)    

*How to Meet the People YOU Want to Meet Politicians don’t wait for others to approach them. If the party host or their campaign manager has not supplied a “must meet” list, they choose their targets while Rubbernecking the Room. As their keen eyes scan the crowd, they’re asking themselves “Who would I most enjoy talking to? Who looks like they could be most ben- eficial to my life? Who could I learn most from in this gang?” How do they choose? They look at everyone the same way my friend, Bob, the caricature artist, looks at people. You can tell a whole lot more than you realize if you keep your gaze fixed on someone. Every twinkle in someone’s eye and every line sur- rounding it tells a story—the story of the life he or she leads. Who was it who said, “At age thirty, everyone has the face he deserves”? Yet few of us consciously look into strangers’ eyes.*

*In my networking seminar, I prime participants to make intense visual contact by asking them to form a big circle, walk around the room, and silently stare at each other. “Gaze into each other’s eyes,” I tell them. “Examine each other’s movements.” As they are walking, I say, “The most important business con- tact, the dearest friend, or the love of your life is probably not in 274 Copyright 2003 by Leil Lowndes.

Nevertheless, sometime soon, you will be in a room where you will spot someone you sense could change your life. I want you to be prepared. I want you to have the courage to make the approach and not wait in vain for that special someone to approach you.” While strolling and staring, I ask them to silently choose the four people they most want to talk to during the break. “Only the Beautiful People Will Be Chosen” When given this unfamiliar and uncomfortable assignment, the participants assume everyone will make a beeline for the most attractive people. It never happens. Something mystical occurs when people take the time to really look at each other. Everyone discovers a distinctive beauty in one or two other people that is very personal, very special, and speaks uniquely to the seeker. The dearest friend in my life was a homely little fellow named Chip. He was only 5 feet 2 inches tall. Chip had a huge nose and funny little eyes peeping out through thick glasses. At a party, without using this technique, I probably would never have noticed Chip. However, my concentration was on him the day we met because he was giving a speech. When I gazed intently into his eyes and watched his lips moving, I saw such subjective beauty coming from his face.*

*When you seek people’s special qualities by exploring their faces, you will find them. If you want to walk out of any gather- ing with your life enhanced, spend time with people you choose, not just those who choose you. Be choosey in who you pick. But don’t wait to be the choosee.*  

- Page 286 (location ~ 4381-4384)    

*Technique #73 Be the Chooser, Not the Choosee The lifelong friend, the love of your life, or the business contact who will transform your future may not be at the party. However, someday, somewhere, he or she will be. Make every party a rehearsal for the big event. Do not stand around waiting for the moment when that special person approaches you. You make it happen by exploring every face in the room. No more “ships passing in the night.” Capture whatever or whomever you want in your life.*  

- Page 286 (location ~ 4384-4389)    

*How to Subliminally Lure People to You at a Gathering Have you ever noticed how comfortable you feel sauntering into certain rooms? The chairs are arranged in a way that welcomes you as if saying, “Come right on in and sit on me.” Conversely, you enter other rooms where you must navigate a circuitous route around tables and dressers before you finally find a free chair. Likewise, some people arrange their body furniture, their arms and legs, to say, “Hey, come right on over and talk to me.” Yet other people’s body furniture shouts, “Keep out! Approach at your own risk.” Shy people inadvertently say “stay away” when they fold their arms. They give off insecure signals by clutching a purse, clasping a drink, or smoking a cigarette. Controlled studies show that party goers are more comfort- able approaching people who stand with an open body, arms uncrossed and hanging at their sides, legs slightly separated, a slight smile on their faces. Any object between you and the crowd is a subliminal cutoff—even your purse. More people approach a woman who sports a shoulder bag than one squeezing a handbag. The shoulder bag hangs behind her back, thus leaving the path to talk to her open.*  

- Page 288 (location ~ 4404-4416)    

*When you are listening to a business colleague to whom you want to signal acceptance, make sure your wrists and palms are up. Even if you’re resting your head on your chin, turn your wrists forward. Whenever you are chat- ting with anyone, give yourself a constant hand check. Make sure you don’t point your knuckles directly toward anyone. Let them have the pleasure of seeing the soft, tender “come hither” skin of your wrists and palms, not the wrinkled “go away” hide on your knuckles. Romance on your mind? Ladies, let your hands do some talk- ing for you. Women instinctively turn their wrists and palms upward when a man excites them. (In fact, the ol’ wrist flash while talking with males subconsciously gives them a sexy jolt.)*  

- Page 289 (location ~ 4425-4432)    

*Technique #74 Come-Hither Hands Be a human magnet, not a human repellent. When standing at a gathering, arrange your body in an open position—especially your arms and hands. People instinctively gravitate toward open palms and wrists seductively arranged in the “come hither” position. They shy away from knuckles in the “get lost or I’ll punch you” position. Use your wrists and palms to say “I have nothing to hide,” “I accept you and what you’re saying,” or “I find you sexy.” Whereas lynxes and lions stroll confidently to the center of the jungle clearing, human big cats in the social jungle also stand confidently in a clearing so others can see them. Like a politician, position yourself near a doorway since everyone must pass your way at some point in the evening.*

*In the 1940s, movies were different. Before experimental films, cin- ema verité, and nouvelle vague, they had stories. Americans hopped in their Buicks—a foxtail tied to the radio antenna and baby boots suspended from the rearview mirror—drove to the movie house, and watched a story unfold before them. Almost invariably, the hero and heroine on the silver screen would meet, fall in love, overcome seemingly impossible obstacles, get married, and (presumably) live happily after. Oh, the stories varied slightly. But there was always a leading man and maybe a leading woman. Then there was the rest of the world. The sup- porting characters could live or die without much brouhaha. But every minor event in the star’s life was significant. Well, movies may have changed. Human nature hasn’t. Every- one feels like the star of a 1940s movie. Every trivial event in their lives is momentous. “There’s ME. Then there’s the rest of the world.” What someone had for breakfast, what shoes he chose to wear, and whether he took time to floss his teeth can be more impor- tant to that particular someone than the fall of faraway nations or the rise of global temperatures.*

*Don’t Leave It to Chance Politicians make a science out of Tracking. They keep a little black box either on their desk, in their computer, or in their brain of the last concern, enthusiasm, or event discussed with everyone in their life. They keep track of where the people were, what they said, and what they were doing since the last conversation.*  

- Page 292 (location ~ 4474-4477)    

*One of the most powerful forms of tracking is remembering anniversaries of people’s personal achievements. Did your boss get promoted to her present position one year ago today? Did your client go public? How much more memorable than a birthday card to send a one-year congratulations note. Remembering people’s private passions is another. Several years ago, I wrote regularly for a magazine. My then-editor, Car- rie, was obsessed with her new kitten named Cookie. Recently I ran into Carrie at a writer’s conference. In early conversation I said to her, “I guess Cookie’s a full-grown cat by now. How is she?” Carrie’s astonished smile was my reward. “Leil,” she squealed, “I can’t believe you remember Cookie. Yes, she’s fine now and . . .” Carrie went on for another ten min- utes about Cookie, the now full-grown cat.*  

- Page 293 (location ~ 4485-4493)    

*Technique #75 Tracking Like an air-traffic controller, track the tiniest details of your conversation partners’ lives. Refer to them in your conversation like a major news story. It creates a power- ful sense of intimacy. When you invoke the last major or minor event in anyone’s life, it confirms the deep conviction that he or she is an old-style hero around whom the world revolves. And people love you for recognizing their stardom.*  

- Page 294 (location ~ 4493-4498)    

*Technique #76 The Business Card Dossier Right after you’ve talked to someone at a party, take out your pen. On the back of his or her business card write notes to remind you of the conversation: his favorite restaurant, sport, movie, or drink; whom she admires, where she grew up, a high school honor; or maybe a joke he told. In your next communication, toss off a reference to the favorite restaurant, sport, movie, drink, hometown, high school honor. Or reprieve the laugh over the great joke. They may not jump up and down asking, “How did you remember that?” Nevertheless, they will remember you.*

*While Jimmi is giving his sales pitch, he’s concentrating more on how his customer fidgets, twitches, and squirms than on what he’s saying. He’s scrutinizing his customer’s involuntary head move- ments. He’s studying her hand gestures, her body rotation, her facial expressions—even her eye fluctuations. Jimmi says when his cus- tomer is not saying a word, even if she’s trying to give you a poker face, she cannot not communicate. She may not say in words how receptive she is to your pitch, but she’s clearly telling you nonethe- less. Jimmi says knowing what turns a prospect on, what turns her off, and what leaves her neutral from moment to moment can make or break the sale.*  

- Page 297 (location ~ 4550-4556)    

*Some signals are obvious,” Jimmi says. “People shrug their shoul- ders for indifference, tap their fingers for impatience, or loosen their collar when they feel uncomfortable. But there are hundreds of other unconscious gestures I keep my antennae tuned for. “For example, I watch the exact angle of my prospect’s head position. If it’s fully facing me, especially if it’s cocked at a cute little angle, it means they’re interested. In that case, I keep right on talking. But if their head is slightly turning away, that’s a bad sign. I take it as a cue to change the subject and maybe talk about a different benefit of my product.”*

*Like a politician, think of your social conversations as sales pitches. Even if you have no product, you want them to buy your ideas. If your listener turns away while you’re talking, don’t con- 08 (265-292) part eight 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 291 How to Make the Sale with Your Eyeballs 291 centrate on how rude the person is. Like a sales pro, ask yourself, “How can I change the subject to turn this person on?” If their whole body starts to turn away, use the time-honored personal question ploy. Ask about their favorite topic. “George, how big did you say that bass you caught last week was?” Or use his name and ask a personal question. That’s always a grabber. “Archibald, what did you say the name of your high school football team was?” We’ve talked about only a few responses. Hints for reading someone’s body language could fill a book. In fact, they have— many of them. I suggest a few of my favorites in the references.21–26 Read up on body language and tune in to its visual channel when- ever you’re trying to sell to people, get their vote, or convince them you’re the best candidate for the job or the role of life partner.*

*Technique #77 Eyeball Selling The human body is a twenty-four-hour broadcasting station that transmits “You thrill me.” “You bore me.” “I love that aspect of your product.” “That one puts my feet to sleep.” Set the hidden cameras behind your eyeballs to pick up on all your customers’ and friends’ signals. Then plan your pitch and your pace accordingly. Wouldn’t it be super to have Jimmi’s success rate with our listeners accepting whatever we say? We can if we just keep our eyes open.*

*Just as I was about to say, “Oh dear,” I bit my tongue. Before I could grab my napkin to help, Dawson was dabbing the muddy puddle with hers, and not missing a syllable of her soliloquy. None of her cool colleagues at the table even seemed to notice the over- turned cup. At that instant, I realized big boys and big girls see no bloop- ers, hear no bloopers. They never say “Butterfingers” or “Whoops” or even “Uh-oh.” They ignore their colleagues’ boners. They sim- ply don’t notice their comrades’ minor spills, slips, fumbles, and blunders. Thus, the technique “See No Bloopers, Hear No Bloop- ers” was born.*  

- Page 307 (location ~ 4701-4707)    

*Technique #78 See No Bloopers, He ar No Bloopers Cool communicators allow their friends, associates, acquaintances, and loved ones the pleasurable myth of being above commonplace bloopers and embarrassing biological functions. They simply don’t notice their comrades’ minor spills, slips, fumbles, and faux pas. They obviously ignore raspberries and all other signs of human frailty in their fellow mortals. Big winners never gape at another’s gaffes.*

*If people hate to be reminded of the moments when they’re not shining, there is another event almost as disillusioning. It is when a talker is shining and the spotlight abruptly pivots to a more urgent matter. The speaker is forgotten in the flurry. Top communicators put the glow back in the gloomy gabber’s eyes with the technique that follows.*  

- Page 309 (location ~ 4730-4733)    

*Most joke and story tellers are too timid to say, after the inva- sion, “Now, as I was saying . . .” Instead, they’ll spend the rest of the evening feeling miserable they didn’t get to finish. Here’s where you come in. Rescue them with the technique I call “Lend a Help- ing Tongue.” Watch the gratitude in the storyteller’s eyes as he stabilizes where his story sunk and he sails off again toward the center of attention. His expression and the recognition of your sensitivity by the rest of the group are often reward enough. You are even more fortunate if you can rescue the story of someone who can hire you, promote you, buy from you, or otherwise lift your life. Big winners have elephantine memories. When you do them subtle favors like Lend a Helping Tongue, they find a way to pay you back.*  

- Page 310 (location ~ 4751-4759)    

*Technique #79 Lend a Helping Tongue Whenever someone’s story is aborted, let the interrup- tion play itself out. Give everyone time to dote on the little darling, give their dinner order, or pick up the jagged pieces of china. Then, when the group reassembles, simply say to the person who suffered story-interruptus, “Now please get back to your story.” Or better yet, remember where they were and then ask, “So what happened after the . . .” (and fill in the last few words).*

*Savvy businesspeople know everyone is constantly tuned to the same radio station—WIIFM. Whenever anyone says anything, the listener’s instinctive reaction is “what’s in it for me?” Sales pros have elevated this constant query to the exalted status of acronym, WIIFM. They pay such strict attention to the WIIFM principle that they don’t open their pitch with the features of their product or service. Top pros start by highlighting the benefits to the buyer.*

*I once invited a casual acquaintance to lunch. I had hoped to consult with Sam, the head of a marketing association, on my speaking business. I told him my desire and jokingly asked if an hour of his valuable time was available in return for lunch at a great restaurant. That was my way of saying, “Look Sam, I know there’s no real benefit to you except a tasty lunch and the dubious plea- sure of my company.” (In other words, I was revealing WIIFY.) To make the meeting even more convenient for him, I said, “Sam, choose the date and the best restaurant in your neighborhood.”*  

- Page 312 (location ~ 4779-4784)    

*Big winners also lay their cards on the table when asking someone for a favor. Many well-meaning folks are embarrassed to say how important the favor is to them. So they ask as though it’s a casual inquiry when it’s not. A friend of mine named Stefan once asked me if I knew any bands his organization could hire for their annual event. I told him “No, I’m sorry. I really don’t.” But Stefan didn’t let it go at that. He pressed, “Leil, didn’t you once work with bands on ships?” 09 (293-342B) part nine 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 305 How to Let ’Em Know “What’s In It” for Them 305 I told him “Yes, but I no longer have contact with them.” I thought that was the end of it. But Stefan didn’t. He grilled me further and I found myself getting confused and irritated. Finally I said, “Stefan, who’s in charge of getting the band?” He sheepishly said, “I am.” “Criminy jicketts, Stefan, why didn’t you tell me it was your responsibility? In that case, let me do some research and see if I can find a good one for you.” I was happy to do my friend a favor.*

*Technique #80 Bare the Buried WIIFM (and WIIF Y) Whenever you suggest a meeting or ask a favor, divulge the respective benefits. Reveal what’s in it for you and what’s in it for the other person—even if it’s zip. If any hidden agenda comes up later, you get labeled a sly fox. Asking or granting favors is a fabric that holds together only when woven with utmost sensitivity. Let us explore more ways to stitch this delicate cloth so your relationship doesn’t rip.*

*Harry must have hot-breathedly called Cousin Sonny to give him the big headline: Evans Would See Him! Then, by dialing Ms. Evans immediately, Sonny made it seem the big- deal interview was the most important event in his otherwise dull and dismal life. True or not, one verity remained—Little Cousin was insensi- tive to an unspoken rule big winners always obey: don’t jump immediately when someone is doing you a favor. Allow the per- son granting the favor time to savor the pleasure of agreeing to it, before having to pay up. Both brother-in-law and potential employee slipped in Evans’s estimate, all because of timing. To ensure the kid wouldn’t call his real-estate-mogul sister-in-law too quickly, Harry should have waited a day before telling his cousin the good news.*

*Technique #81 Let ’Em Savor the Favor Whenever a friend agrees to a favor, allow your generous buddy time to relish the joy of his or her beneficence before you make them pay the piper. How long? At least twenty-four hours. One might think Evans was unfair judging Sonny harshly just because he didn’t let her savor the favor. It runs deeper than that. Evans’s subconscious thought process goes something like this: “If this kid is insensitive to the subtleties of timing when getting a 09 (293-342B) part nine 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 308 308 How to Talk to Anyone job, how sensitive is he going to be when negotiating the sale of a house?” One agent’s overanxious call to an owner can mean thou- sands lost in commissions for the firm. Big winners have supernatural vision into your future. They see every communications blunder you make as a visible blotch on your x-ray. It dims your prognosis for being successful in life. Let’s look at yet another tenuous thread between favor asker and favor grantor that must not be severed lest the relationship unravel.*

*When you do someone a favor and they obviously “owe you one,” wait a few weeks. Don’t make it look like tit for tat. Allow the favor asker the pleasurable myth that you joyfully did the favor with no thought of what you’re going to get in return. They know that’s not true. You know that’s not true. But only little losers make it obvious.*

*Technique #82 Tit for (Wait . . . Wait) Tat When you do someone a favor and it’s obvious that “he owes you one,” wait a suitable amount of time before asking him to “pay.” Let him enjoy the fact (or fiction) that you did it out of friendship. Don’t call in your tit for their tat too swiftly.*

*Technique #83 Parties Are for Prat ter There are three sacred safe havens in the human jungle where even the toughest tiger knows he must not attack. The first of these is parties. Parties are for pleasantries and good fellowship, not for confrontations. Big players, even when standing next to their enemies at the buffet table, smile and nod. They leave tough talk for tougher settings. Let’s move to the second safe haven where big cats can escape the claws of bigger cats and, they hope, the growls of lesser ones.*

*Technique #84 Dinner’s for Dining The most guarded safe haven respected by big winners is the dining table. Breaking bread together is a time when they bring up no unpleasant matters. While eating, they know it’s OK to brainstorm and discuss the positive side of the business: their dreams, their desires, their designs. They can free associate and come up with new ideas. But no tough business.*

*This convention probably arose out of a prudent agreement not to inflict indigestion on each other. Tough negotiating is unpalatable and can ruin an otherwise perfectly mouthwatering veal chop.*

*Incidentally, the same rule applies in the social jungle. If one partner in a friendship or a love relationship has some heavy rela- tionship issues to discuss, save them for after dessert. Even if you don’t solve the problem, you want to enjoy the delicious chocolate soufflé. Let’s crawl into our third and final safe haven to explore it.*

*Technique #85 Chanc e Encount ers Are for Chitchat If you’re selling, negotiating, or in any sensitive communication with someone, do NOT capitalize on a chance meeting. Keep the melody of your mistaken meeting sweet and light. Otherwise, it could turn into your swan song with Big Winner. Consistently create safe havens for people if you want them to elevate you to the status of big winner. You may find yourself dining with them, going to parties with them, getting big “hellos” in the hall, and closing deals much faster than during business hours. Who knows? If it’s your desire, you even make yourself eli- gible for some heavy socializing at the top. Big winners make it safe for each other to accept invitations to play golf, spend the weekend in their country homes, or relax by each other’s pools.*

*When You Have Important Information to Impart Any kid working in a garage knows you can’t pump more gas into a full tank. Too much topping it off, and it splashes onto the cement. Likewise, your listener’s brain is always full of his or her own thoughts, worries, and enthusiasms. If you pump your ideas into your listener’s brain, which is full of her own notions, you’ll get a polluted mixture, then a spill. If you want your supersupreme ideas to flow into her tank unpolluted, drain her tank completely first.*

*Technique #86 Empt y Their Tanks If you need information, let people have their entire say first. Wait patiently until their needle is on empty and the last drop drips out and splashes on the cement. It’s the only way to be sure their tank is empty enough of their own inner noise to start receiving your ideas.*

*Emo is a word invented by Helen Gurley Brown, the grand dame of Cosmopolitan magazine. Emo translated is “Give more emotion!” Once Cosmopolitan asked me to write an article on communicat- ing sensitive matters (most specifically advising young women on how to make their boyfriends more passionate). I interviewed a passel of psychologists, communications experts, and sexologists. My draft came back from Cosmo all marked up with “MORE EMO” scribbled on every page. I called my editor and asked what it meant. She said that was Helen’s way of saying downplay all that factual stuff with the sex therapists and so-called experts. Write about the emotion the young woman feels when her boyfriend isn’t passionate enough, the emo- tion the accused male feels when confronted, and the emotion the couple feels about discussing their quandary. Helen Gurley Brown, a certified big winner, liked to have it all and knew just how to get it. Helen recognized, when the time is right, reject the rational and empathize with the emotions. In other words, smear on the emo.*

*Technique #87 Echo the Emo Facts speak. Emotions shout. Whenever you need facts from people about an emotional situation, let them emote. Hear their facts but empathize like mad with their emotions. Smearing on the emo is often the only way to calm their emotional storm. There’s more to this story, but let me pause here to interject the Echo the Emo technique. The clever customer service rep not only emptied my tanks and softened me up with Echo the Emo. She completely dissolved me with the next technique.*

*Technique #88 My Goof, Your Gain Whenever you make a boner, make sure your victim benefits. It’s not enough to correct your mistake. Ask yourself, “What could I do for this suffering soul so he or she will be delighted I made the flub?” Then do it, fast! In that way, your goof will become your gain. Now, suppose it’s not your boo-boo. It’s theirs. How can you make their goof your gain? Read on.*

*Big winners leave an escape hatch for the small foibles of friends they wish to keep by taking the blame themselves. If a friend gets lost and is an hour late arriving at your house, tell her “Those directions I gave you were terrible.” He breaks your Limoges bowl? “Oh I shouldn’t have left it in such a precarious position.” It’s the 09 (293-342B) part nine 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 329 How to Trap a Rat with Class 329 old mea culpa routine that endears you to everyone, especially when they realize it wasn’t your fault.*

*Technique #89 Le av e an Esc ape Hatch Whenever you catch someone lying, filching, exagger- ating, distorting, or deceiving, don’t confront the dirty duck directly. Unless it is your responsibility to catch or correct the culprit—or unless you are saving other innocent victims by doing so—let the transgressor out of your trap with his tricky puss in one piece. Then resolve never to gaze upon it again. Residents of Toronto, Canada, have a well-earned reputation for grace. They demonstrated it last year in a downtown Toronto drugstore. A shopper attempted to stroll out through the security system with a purloined object in his pocket. Instead of a shrill alarm shattering all shoppers’ eardrums, as in many American cities, a tasteful little chime sounded. A charming voice came across the public address. “Excuse us, we have failed to inactivate the inventory control system. Thank you for your patience while you wait for a customer care representative to come help you.” Isn’t that a nicer way of saying “Freeze, punk, while we come frisk you?”*

*Now I have a standard one in my computer. The buttercup reads as follows: Dear [name of supervisor], I know how important customer service is to an organization such as yours. This letter is to com- mend [name of employee]. He/She is an example of an [employee title] who gives exceptional customer service. [Name of store or business] continues to have my business thanks in great part to the service given by [name of employee]. Gratefully, [signature]*

*Cool Cats Clap First You are sitting in an auditorium with hundreds of fellow employ- ees listening to the president of your firm introduce a new con- cept. As you’re slouching anonymously in the audience, you think your expression is invisible to the man or woman at the podium. Not so! As a speaker, I guarantee you every one of my colleagues 333 Copyright 2003 by Leil Lowndes.

Likewise, the company president making a presentation anx- iously surveys his corporate jungle and, from the pusses peering back at him, senses which employees are sympathetic and which are not. He also knows which in the sea of faces floating in front of him has the potential to be a heavy hitter like himself. How?*

*Technique #91 Le ad the Listeners No matter how prominent the big cat behind the podium is, crouched inside is a little scaredy-cat who is anxious about the crowd’s acceptance. Big winners recognize you’re a fellow big winner when they see you leading their listeners in a positive reaction. Be the first to applaud or publicly commend the man or woman you agree with (or want favors from).*

*When the company big shot delivers his last line, carefully contrived to bring the crowd to its feet or employees to acquies- cence, do you think he’s unaware of who starts the trickle, or the riptide, of acceptance? No way! Though his head is down while taking a bow, with the insight of a McCarthy-era spy, he perceives 09 (293-342B) part nine 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 335 How to Be a Leader in a Crowd, Not a Follower 335 precisely who inaugurated the applause, precisely how long after the last words were uttered, and precisely how enthusiastically! Being the first to put your hands together, being the first to jump to your feet, and, if appropriate, being the first to shout “Bravo,” gets you big cat status with the tiger who was talking. Be the first clapper no matter how small the crowd, no mat- ter how informal the talk. Don’t wait to see how everyone else is going to respond. Even if it’s a small group of three or four peo- ple standing around, be the first to empathize with the speaker’s ideas, the first to mutter “good idea.” It’s proof positive you’re a person who trusts his or her own instincts.*

*Big winners—before putting pen to paper, fingers to key- board, mouth to phone, or hand to someone else’s to shake it— do a quick calculation. They ask themselves “Who has the most to benefit from this relationship? What has each of us done recently that demands deference from the other?” And what can I do to even the score? Friends Keep Tabs Too The Great Scorecard in the Sky is not just bobbing over busi- nesspeople. If family members and friends look carefully over their 09 (293-342B) part nine 8/14/03 9:19 AM Page 338 338 How to Talk to Anyone loved ones’ heads, they’ll spot it. And, like an over-the-counter stock, it goes up or down every day. When you mess up, you have to even your score by doing more for the one who didn’t.*

*Technique #92 The Gre at Scorec ard in the Sky Any two people have an invisible scorecard hovering above their heads. The numbers continually fluctuate, but one rule remains: player with lower score pays deference to player with higher score. The penalty for not keeping your eye on The Great Scorecard in the Sky is to be thrown out of the game. Permanently.*
