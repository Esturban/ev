Excitement, action, passion,  
You can always keep me laughing.:joy:   

Where at times surprised,
just how easy you can make me cry.:cry:  

Well, it's by design,
I know that you aren't strictly mine.  
Share you with my friends,
all your stories,
horror to true crime.:detective:   

You'll teach me something, 
often show it,  
with opinions predigested.  
Biasing my thoughts,  
got my mind here feeling so infected.:thought_balloon:   

Documentaries,  
shows suppose reality.  
dramatized to capture me,  
since back in my infancy.:child:

Production teams,  
For which I was unprepared.  
Just as I learn about you,
I become more and more scared.:fearful:    

Embedded in culture,  
just feed off of boredom.  
Take over our minds,  
you don't even warn 'em.:exploding_head:  

About dangers, effects,  
the lasting impressions.  
Got me hooked as a kid,  
with cartoon obsessions.:fishing_pole_and_fish:   

Has me shook with the need,  
to stay tuned to just see.  
When restricted,  
I snap, I'd cry and I'd plead.:weary:  

"Let me see, let me see"  
"For 5 minutes please"

How would one know,  
the cause and effects?  
I binge-watch this screen,  
like all of my friends!:busts_in_silhouette:

Miniseries, shows, new seasons too,  
**[My eyes are exhausted from staring at tubes.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345445/)**:eyes:    

I notice fatigue,  
a tiring exhaustion.  
A couch prisoner,  
the home cell has me locked in.:chains:    

How does this fiction have just so much power?  
I look to escape,
but it's my safety, I cower.:fearful:  

Though hark, the distance.  
What is it I see?  
Some green, some birds,
an opening of trees.:deciduous_tree:    

My window a screen,  
of ultra HD.  
The pastures, the forests,  
they're speaking to me.:sunrise_over_mountains:

"Out here there is love,  
smells of all kinds.  
Sounds, sights, and feels,
overwhelm your soft mind.":princess:    

At first I am distant,  
just like a first date.  
Partner coming on strong,  
haven't finished my first plate.:plate_with_cutlery:  

Though I strap my shoes on,  
tight on my feet.  
I remember TV  
has no control over me.:level_slider:  

Emails and texts,  
saying "we miss you",
"was there a problem?",  
"what was your last issue?":speech_balloon:    

Ignored ignored,  
for I am not bored,  
mother earth is my new girl,    
with her i've just scored.:earth_americas:    

Treats me nice,  
treats me right.  
Always down,  
day or night.  
When we fight,  
quickly she reminds me,  
**[just how she's always right](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656547/)**:raising_hand_woman:

I swing from branch to branch,  
to dodge a midlife crisis,  
In case I one day just wake up,  
whiny just like a pisces.:pisces:    

Instead, I take control,  
of what could happen,  
spend my time under waterfalls and trees,  
I'm outside laughing.  
Cracking up a coconut,  
maple trees i'm sucking out the sap and.:evergreen_tree:    

Watching life pass me by,  
totally fine.  
So long as i'm not inside,  
with TV controlling my mind.:tv:
