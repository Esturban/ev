*Social justice divides the world into good and evil. It is a starkly Manichean view of the moral universe: one that pits heroic LGBT campaigners, feminists, transgender activists and #BlackLivesMatter protesters against the jackbooted fascists of the patriarchal, capitalist Establishment. Yet dig a little deeper, and you realise that the social justice view of the world is horribly patronising, two-dimensional and depressing. It suggests that our aspirations and opinions are necessarily bound by our circumstances of birth: that homosexuals must support grotesquely engorged public sectors to pay for “homophobia awareness” organisations whether they are needed or not; that women are always and in every circumstance victims; that blacks cannot succeed in life without special treatment. This tendency never survives contact with reality because it never sees the exceptions coming. Social justice warriors don’t understand that life, and people, are messy and complicated: that a gay person might, for entirely rational reasons and without a shred of self-loathing, object to the idea of gay marriage. SJWs Always Lie is a truism because you cannot make social justice arguments without purposefully omitting crucial facts. You cannot, in other words, be a social justice warrior in good faith.*

*We’re familiar with the attitude from stereotypical, sadistic preachers of popular fiction, but not for a hundred years here in the West have so many people from so many pedestals insisted on dictating to the rest of us how we shall live. From the dishonest critics of GamerGate to the bigoted and insulting #KillAllMen and #GiveYourMoneyToWomen hashtags, the social justice tendency is a narrow, bossy and often prurient prism from which to view humanity, and one that has acquired, as this book ably demonstrates, an especially poisonous self-righteousness in the last few years. Of course, authoritarians are not restricted to one side of the political divide. Nevertheless, it is an ironic and remarkable feature of the American Left that there is no longer space for liberals within American liberalism.*
