*Now at last, when he was fifty-six years old, he gave up his active career, but he could not bear to be idle for a single day. On the outskirts of the small market-town of Lambach in Upper Austria he bought a farm and tilled it himself. Thus, at the end of a long and hard-working career, he returned to the life which his father had led. It was at this period that I first began to have ideals of my own. I spent a good deal of time scampering about in the open, on the long road from school, and mixing with some of the roughest of the boys, which caused my mother many anxious moments. All this tended to make me something quite the reverse of a stay-at-home. I gave scarcely any serious thought to the question of choosing a vocation in life, but I was certainly quite out of sympathy with the kind of career which my father had followed. I think that an inborn talent for speaking now began to develop and take shape during the more or less strenuous arguments which I used to have with my comrades. I had become a juvenile ringleader who learned well and easily at school, but was rather difficult to manage. In my free time I practised singing in the choir of the monastery church at Lambach, and thus it happened that I was placed in a very favourable position to be emotionally impressed again and again by the magnificent splendour of ecclesiastical ceremonial.*

*My obvious talent for drawing confirmed him in that view, for in his opinion, drawing was a subject too much neglected in the Austrian Gymnasium. Probably also the memory of the hard road which he himself had travelled contributed to make him look upon classical studies as unpractical and accordingly to set little value on them. At the back of his mind he had the idea that his son should also become a government official. Indeed he had decided on that career for me. The difficulties with which he had had to contend in making his own career led him to overestimate what he had achieved, because this was exclusively the result of his own indefatigable industry and energy.*  

- Page 9 (location ~ 124-129)    

*The characteristic pride of the self-made man caused him to cherish the idea that his son should follow the same calling and if possible rise to a higher position in it. Moreover, this idea was strengthened by the consideration that the results of his own life’s industry had placed him in a position to facilitate his son’s advancement in the same profession. He was simply incapable of imagining that I might reject what had meant everything in life to him. My father’s decision was simple, definite, clear and in his eyes, it was something to be taken for granted.*

*All the attempts which my father made to arouse in me a love or liking for that profession, by picturing his own career for me, had only the opposite effect. It nauseated me to think that one day I might be fettered to an office stool, that I could not dispose of my own time, but would be forced to spend the whole of my life filling out forms. One can imagine what kind of thoughts such a prospect awakened in the mind of a boy who was by no means what is called a ‘good boy’ in the current sense of that term. The ease with which I learned my lessons made it possible for me to spend, far more time in the open air than at home.*

*My own resolution not to become a government official was sufficient for the time being to put my mind completely at rest. I held on to that resolution inexorably. But the situation became more difficult once I had a positive plan of my own which I could present to my father as a counter-suggestion. This happened when I was twelve years old. How it came about I cannot exactly say now, but one day it became clear to me that I wanted to be a painter—I mean an artist. That I had an aptitude for drawing was an admitted fact. It was even one of the reasons why my father had sent me to the Realschule; but he had never thought of having that talent developed so that I could take up painting as a professional career. Quite the contrary. When, as a result of my renewed refusal to comply with his favourite plan, my father asked me for the first time what I myself really wished to be, the resolution that I had already formed expressed itself almost automatically. For a while my father was speechless. “A painter? An artist?” he exclaimed. He wondered whether I was in a sound state of mind.*

*There were three groups the fighters, those who were luke-warm, and the traitors. This sifting process began even in the schools and it is worth noting that the struggle for the language was waged perhaps in its bitterest form around the school, because this was the nursery where the seeds had to be tended which were to spring up and form the future generation. The tactical objective of the fight was the winning over of the child, and it was to the child that the first rallying cry was addressed, “German boy, do not forget that you are a German,” and “Remember, little girl, that one day you must be a German mother.”*

*The greater the efforts made to win them away from their German allegiance, the more they exalted the glory of their German heroes. They stinted themselves in buying sweetmeats, so that they might spare their pennies to help the war fund of their elders. They were incredibly alert to the significance of what the non-German teachers said and they contradicted in unison. They wore the forbidden emblems of their own nation and were happy when penalized, or even physically punished. In their own way, they faithfully mirrored their elders, and often their attitude was finer and more sincere. Thus it was that at a comparatively early age I took part in the struggle which the nationalities were waging against one another in the old Austria.*

*To study history means to search for and discover the forces that are the causes of those results which appear before our eyes as historical events. The art of reading and studying consists in remembering the essentials and forgetting what is inessential.*

*What history taught us about the policy followed by the House of Habsburg was corroborated by our own everyday experiences. In the north and in the south the poison of foreign races was eating into the body of our people, and even Vienna was steadily becoming more and more a non-German city. The ‘Imperial House’ favoured the Czechs on every possible occasion. Indeed, it was the hand of the goddess of eternal justice and inexorable retribution that caused the most deadly enemy of Germanism in Austria, the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, to fall by the very bullets which he himself had helped to cast. He was the prime mover in the work, begun by the ruling classes, of turning Austria into a Slav State.*  

- Page 17 (location ~ 249-255)    

*What affected us most bitterly was the consciousness of the fact that this whole system was morally sanctioned by the alliance with Germany, whereby the slow extirpation of Germanism in the old Austrian Monarchy seemed in some way to be more or less countenanced by Germany herself. Habsburg hypocrisy, which endeavoured outwardly to make the people believe that Austria still remained a German State, increased the feeling of hatred against the Imperial House and at the same time aroused a spirit of rebellion and contempt. Only in the German Reich itself did those who were then its rulers fail to understand what all this meant. As if struck blind, they stood beside a corpse and in the very symptoms of decomposition they believed that they recognised the signs of renewed vitality. In that unhappy alliance between the young German Empire and the illusory Austrian State lay the germ of the World War and also of the final collapse.*

*I became more and more convinced that I should never be happy as a government official, and now that the Realschule had recognised and acknowledged my aptitude for drawing, my own resolution became all the stronger. Imprecations and threats had no longer any power to change it. I wanted to become a painter and no power on earth could force me to become a civil servant. The only peculiar feature of, the situation now was that as I grew bigger I became more and more interested in architecture. I considered this fact as a natural complement of my talent for painting and I rejoiced inwardly that the sphere of my artistic interests was thus enlarged. I had no notion that one day it would have to be otherwise.*

*Obstacles are placed across our path in life, not to be boggled at, but to be surmounted, and I was fully determined to surmount these obstacles, having constantly before my mind the picture of my father, who had raised himself by his own efforts to the position of civil servant though he was the poor son of a village shoemaker. I had a better start, and the possibility of winning through was greater. At that time my lot in life seemed to me a harsh one; but to-day I see in it the wise workings of Providence. Adversity had me in its grip and often threatened to smash me; but*

Adversity had me in its grip and often threatened to smash me; but the will grew stronger as the obstacles increased, and finally the will triumphed. I am thankful for that period of my life, because it hardened me and enabled me to be hard, and I am even more thankful because I appreciate the fact that I was thus saved from the emptiness of a life of ease and that a mother’s darling was taken from comfortable surroundings and handed over to Adversity as to a new mother. Though I then rebelled against it as too hard a fate, I am grateful that I was cast, against my wishes, into a world of misery and poverty and thus came to know the people for whom I was afterwards to fight.*

*The very name of that Phaeacian town spells five years of poverty—five years in which, first as a casual labourer and then as a poor painter, I had to earn my daily bread, and a meagre morsel indeed it was, not even sufficient to still the hunger which I constantly felt. That hunger was the faithful companion which never left me and shared in everything I did. Every book that I bought meant renewed hunger, and every visit I paid to the opera meant the intrusion of that inalienable companion during the days that followed. I was always struggling with my unsympathetic friend, and yet during that time I learned more than I had ever learned before. Apart from my architectural studies and rare visits to the opera, for which I had to deny myself food, I had no pleasure in life except my books. I read a great deal then, and I pondered deeply over what I read. All my free time after work was devoted exclusively to study.*

*On the contrary, I am firmly convinced to-day that, generally speaking, it is in youth that men lay the essential groundwork of their creative thought, wherever that creative thought exists. I make a distinction between the wisdom of age—which can only arise from the greater profundity and foresight that are based on the experiences of a long life—and the creative genius of youth, which blossoms out in thought and ideas with inexhaustible fertility, without being able to digest these immediately, because of their very superabundance. These furnish the building materials and plans for the future, and it is from them that age takes the stones and builds the edifice, unless the socalled wisdom of the years has smothered the creative genius of youth. The life which I had hitherto led at home with my parents differed lithe from that of many others. I looked forward without apprehension to the morrow, and there was no such thing as a social problem to be faced. Those among whom I passed my young days belonged to the small bourgeois class. Therefore, it was a world that had very little contact with the world of genuine manual labourers, for, though at first this may appear astonishing, the gulf which separates that class, which is by no means economically well-off, from the manual labouring class is often deeper than people think.*  

- Page 23 (location ~ 353-362)    

*Moreover, there is something repulsive in remembering the cultural indigence of that lower class and their rough manners with one another; so that people who are only on the first rung of the social ladder find it unbearable to be forced to have any contact with the cultural level and standard of living beyond which they have passed. Thus, it happens that very often those who belong to what can really be called the upper classes find it much easier than do the upstarts to descend to and intermingle with their fellow-beings on the lowest social level, for, by the word upstart. I mean everyone who has raised himself through his own efforts to a social level higher than that to which he formerly belonged. In the case of such a person the hard struggle through which he has passed often destroys his innate human sympathy. His own fight for existence kills his sensibility to the misery of those who have been left behind. From this point of view Fate had been kind to me. Circumstances forced me to return to that world of poverty and economic insecurity above which my father had raised himself in his early days, and thus the blinkers of a narrow petit bourgeois education were torn from my eyes. Now for the first time I learned to know men and I learned to distinguish between an outer polish or coarse manners and the real inner nature of people.*

*There was hardly any other German city in which the social problem could be studied better than in Vienna. But here I must utter a warning against the illusion that this problem can be ‘studied’ from a higher social level. The man who has never been in the clutches of that gushing viper can never know what its poison is. An attempt to study it in any other way will result only in superficial talk and sentimental delusions. Both are harmful; the first, because it can never go to the root of the problem, the second, because it evades the question entirely. I do not know which is the more nefarious—to ignore social distress, as do the majority of those who have been favoured by fortune and those who have risen in the social scale through their own efforts, or the equally supercilious and often tactless, but always genteel, condescension displayed by people who have a craze for being charitable and who plume themselves on ‘sympathising with the people.’ Of course such persons sin to a degree which they, with their lack of instinctive understanding, are, unable to realise, and thus they are astonished to find that the social conscience on which they pride themselves never produces any results, but often causes their good intentions to be resented, and then they talk of the ingratitude of the people.*

Such persons are slow to learn that social activity is something very different and that they cannot expect gratitude since they are not distributing favours, but establishing rights. I was protected against the temptation to study the social question in the way just mentioned, for the simple reason that I was forced to suffer myself.*

*Although the skilled worker was not so frequently thrown idle as the unskilled worker, yet the former was by no means protected against the same fate; because though he might not have to face hunger as a result of unemployment due to the lack of demand on the labour market, the lock-out and the strike deprived the skilled worker of the chance to earn his bread. The element of uncertainty in earning one’s daily bread causes far-reaching and serious repercussions throughout the whole social-economic structure. The country lad who migrates to the big city feels attracted by what has been described as easy work (which it may be in reality) and shorter working hours and especially by the magic glamour of the big city. Accustomed in the country to earn a steady wage, he has been taught not to quit his former post until a new one is at least in view. As there is a great scarcity of agricultural labour, the probability of long unemployment in the country is very slight. It is mistake to assume that the lad who leaves the countryside for the town is not made of such sound material as those who remain at home to work on the land. On the contrary, experience shows that it is the more healthy and more vigorous that emigrate, and not the reverse. Among these emigrants I include not merely those who emigrate to America, but also the farm-hand who decides to leave his native village and migrate to the big city, where he will be a stranger. He is ready to take the risk of an uncertain fate.*

*To find work anew, especially in winter, is often difficult and indeed sometimes impossible. For the first few weeks life is still bearable. He receives his out-of-work money from his tradeunion and is thus enabled to carry on. But when the last of his own money is gone and his tradeunion ceases to pay out because of prolonged unemployment, then comes real distress. He now loiters about and is hungry. Often he pawns or sells the last of his belongings. His clothes begin to get shabby and with the increasing shabbiness of his outward appearance he descends to a lower social level and, in addition to his physical misery, now mixes with a class of human beings through whom his mind becomes poisoned. When he has nowhere to sleep, and if this happens in winter, as is very often the case, he is in dire distress. Finally he gets work, but the same story repeats itself a second time, then a third time, and now it is probably much worse. Little by little, he becomes indifferent to this everlasting insecurity. Finally he grows used to the repetition. Thus, even a man who is normally of industrious habits grows careless in his whole attitude towards life and gradually becomes an instrument in the hands of unscrupulous people who exploit him for the sake of their own ignoble aims.*

*Often there are a wife and children at home, and in many cases it happens that these become infected by such a way of living, especially if the husband is good to them and loves them in his own way and according to his own lights. Then the week’s earnings are spent in common at home within two or three days. The family eats and drinks together as long as the money lasts and at the end of the week they hunger together. Then the wife wanders about furtively in the neighbourhood, borrows, a little and runs up small debts with the, shopkeepers, in an effort to pull through the lean days towards the end of the week. They sit down together to the midday meal, with only meagre fare on the table and often even nothing to eat. They wait for the corning pay-day, talking of it and making plans; and while they are thus hungry they dream of the plenty that is to come, and so the little children become acquainted with misery in their early years. The evil culminates when the husband goes his own way from the beginning and the wife protests, simply out of love for the children.*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 449-457)    

*Then there are quarrels and bad feeling and the husband takes to drink as he becomes more and more estranged from his wife. He now becomes drunk every Saturday. Fighting for her own existence and that of the children, the wife has to dog his footsteps on the road from the factory to the tavern in order to get a few shillings from him on pay-day. Then when he finally comes home, maybe on the Sunday or the Monday, having parted with his last pence, terrible scenes take place. I have had actual experience of all this in hundreds of cases. At first I was disgusted and indignant, but later on I came to recognise the whole tragedy of their misfortune and to understand the profound causes of it. They were the unhappy victims of evil circumstances. Housing conditions were very bad at that time. In Vienna manual labourers lived in surroundings of appalling misery. I shudder even to-day when I think of the woeful dens in which people dwelt, the night-shelters and the slums, and all the tenebrous spectacles of ordure, loathsome filth and wickedness. What will happen one day when hordes of emancipated slaves come forth from these dens of misery to swoop down on their unthinking fellows?*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 457-466)    

*During my struggle for existence in Vienna I perceived, very clearly that the aim of all social activity must never be merely charitable relief, which is ridiculous and useless, but it must rather be a means to find a way of eliminating the fundamental deficiencies in our economic and cultural life, deficiencies which necessarily bring about the degradation of the individual or at least lead him towards such degradation. The difficulty of employing any means, even the most drastic, to overcome the hostility towards the State prevailing among certain criminal classes is largely due to an attitude of uncertainty regarding the inner motives and causes of this contemporary phenomenon. The reasons for this uncertainty are to be found in a sense of guilt for having permitted this tragedy of degradation. That feeling paralyses every serious and firm resolve and so contributes to the vacillating, and therefore weak and ineffectual, application of even those measures which are indispensable for self-preservation.*  

- Page 32 (location ~ 480-487)    

*I do not know what appalled me most at that time; the economic misery of those who were, then my companions, their crude customs and morals, or the low level of their culture. How often does our bourgeoisie rise up in moral indignation on hearing from the mouth of some pitiable tramp that it is all the same to him whether he be a German or not, and that he will feel at home wherever he can get enough to keep body and soul together. They bewail such a lack of ‘national pride’ and express their horror at such sentiments. But how many people really ask themselves why it is that their own sentiments are better? How many of them understand that their natural pride in being members of so favoured a nation arises from the innumerable succession of instances they have encountered which remind them of the greatness of their country and their nation in all spheres of artistic and cultural life? How many of them realise that pride in their country is largely dependent on knowledge of its greatness in all those spheres? Do our bourgeois circles ever think what a ridiculously meagre share the people have in that knowledge which is a necessary prerequisite for the feeling of pride in one’s country?*

*The French boy is not educated on purely objective principles. Wherever the importance of the political and cultural greatness of his country is concerned, he is taught in the most subjective way imaginable. Education ought always to be on broad, general lines and these ought to be deeply engraved, by constant repetition if necessary, on the memories and feelings of the people. In our case, however, we are not merely guilty of sins of omission, but also of positively perverting the little which some individuals had the luck to learn at school. The rats that poison our body politic gnaw from the hearts and memories of the broad masses even that little which distress and misery have left.*

*When the lad leaves school, at the age of fourteen, it would be difficult to say what are the most striking features of his character, incredible ignorance in so far as real knowledge is concerned or cynical impudence combined with an attitude towards morality which is really startling in one so young. What position can a person fill in the world which he is about to enter, if to him nothing is sacred, if he has never come into contact with anything noble but, on the contrary, has been intimately acquainted with the lowest kind of human existence? The child of three has got into the habit of reviling all authority by the time he is fifteen. He has been acquainted only with moral filth and vileness, everything being excluded that might stimulate his thoughts towards higher things. Now this young specimen of humanity enters the school of life. He leads the same kind of life which was exemplified for him by his father during his childhood. He loiters about the streets and comes home at all hours. He even blackguards that broken-hearted being who gave him birth. He curses God and the world and finally ends up in a reformatory for young people where he acquires the final polish, and his bourgeois contemporaries are astonished at the lack of ‘patriotic enthusiasm’ which this young ‘citizen’ displays. Day after day the bourgeois world sees how poison is spread among the people through the medium of the theatre, the cinema, gutter journalism and obscene*

*My present occupation was, therefore, in line with the profession I aimed at for the future. Moreover, I was master of my own time and could arrange my working-hours better than formerly. I painted in order to earn my bread, and I studied because I liked it. Thus I was able to acquire that theoretical knowledge of the social problem which was a necessary complement to what I was learning through actual experience. I studied all the books which I could find that dealt with this question and I thought deeply on what I read. I think that the people among whom I then lived considered me an eccentric person. Besides my interest in the social question I naturally devoted myself with enthusiasm to the study of architecture. Side by side with music, I considered it queen of the arts. To study it was for me not work but pleasure. I could read or draw into the small hours of the morning without ever getting tired, and I became more and more confident that my dream of a brilliant future would come true, even though I should have to wait long years for its fulfilment. I was firmly convinced that one day I should make a name for myself as an architect.*

*The fact that, side by side with my professional studies, I took the greatest interest in everything that had to do with politics did not seem to me to signify anything of great importance. On the contrary, I looked upon this practical interest in politics merely as part of an elementary obligation that devolves on every thinking man. Those who have no understanding of the political world around them have no right to criticise or complain.*

*Reading is not an end in itself, but a means to an end. Its chief purpose is to help towards filling in the framework which is made up of the talents and capabilities that each individual possesses. Thus each one procures for himself the implements and materials necessary for the fulfilment of his calling in life, no matter whether this be the elementary task of earning one’s daily bread or a career taken up in response to a higher call.*

Thus each one procures for himself the implements and materials necessary for the fulfilment of his calling in life, no matter whether this be the elementary task of earning one’s daily bread or a career taken up in response to a higher call. Such is the first purpose of reading, and the second purpose is to give us a general knowledge of the world in which we live. In both cases, however, the material which we have acquired through reading must not be stored up in the memory on a plan that corresponds to the successive chapters of the book, but each little piece of knowledge thus gained must be treated as if it were a little stone to be inserted into a mosaic, so that it finds its proper place among all the other pieces and particles that help to form a general world-picture in the brain of the reader.*  

- Page 38 (location ~ 569-576)    

*On the other hand, a man who has cultivated the art of reading will instantly discern, in a book, a journal or a pamphlet, what ought to be remembered because it meets his personal needs or is of value as general knowledge. What he thus learns is incorporated in his mental conception of this or that problem or thing, further correcting the mental picture or enlarging it so that it becomes more exact and precise. Should some practical problem suddenly demand examination or solution, memory will immediately select the requisite information from the mass that has been acquired through years of reading and will place this information at the service of a man’s powers of judgment so he may gain a new and clearer view of the problem, or even solve it. Only thus can reading have any meaning or value. The speaker, for example, who has not the sources of information ready to hand which are necessary to a proper treatment of his subject, is unable to defend his opinions against an opponent, even though those opinions be perfectly sound and true. In every discussion his memory will leave him shamefully in the lurch. He cannot summon up arguments to support his statements or to refute his opponent. So long as the speaker has only to defend himself on his own personal account, the situation is not serious, but the evil arises when Fate places at the head of public affairs such a soi-disant know-all, who in reality knows nothing. From early youth I endeavoured to read books in the right way and I was fortunate in having a good memory and intelligence to assist me. From that point of view my sojourn in Vienna was particularly useful and profitable. My daily experiences there were a constant stimulus to study the most diverse problems from new angles.*

*What I knew of Social Democracy in my youth was precious little and that little was for the most part wrong. The fact that it led the struggle for universal suffrage and the secret ballot gave me an inner satisfaction, for my reason then told me that this would weaken the Habsburg regime, which I so thoroughly detested. I was convinced that except at the cost of sacrificing the German element, the Danubian State could not continue to exist. Even a long and steady Slavisation of the Austrian Germans would not have constituted a guarantee that the Empire would endure, because it was very questionable if, and how far, the Slays possessed the necessary capacity for preserving the State as such. Therefore, I welcomed every movement that might lead towards the final disruption of that impossible State which, to continue to exist, would have to stamp out the German character in ten million people.*

*Accordingly, I had no feeling of antipathy towards the actual policy of the Social Democrats. That its avowed purpose was to raise the level of the working classes (which, in my ignorance, I then foolishly believed) was a further point in favour of Social Democracy rather than against it,) but the feature that contributed most to estrange me from the Social Democratic movement was its hostile attitude towards the struggle for the preservation of Germanism in Austria and its undignified wooing of the Slav ‘comrades,’ who received these approaches favourably as long as any, practical advantages were forthcoming, but otherwise maintained*

*From the very moment I started work the situation was not very pleasant for me. My clothes were still rather decent, I was careful of my speech and I was reserved in manner. I was so occupied with thinking of my own present lot and future prospects that I did not take much interest in my immediate surroundings. I had sought work so that I should not starve and at the same time so as to be able to make further headway with my studies, though this headway might be slow. Possibly I should not have bothered about my companions had it not been that on the third or fourth day an event occurred which forced me to take a definite stand. I was called upon to join the tradeunion. At that time I knew nothing about the tradeunions. I had had no opportunity of forming an opinion on their utility or inutility, as the case might be, but when I was told that I must join the union, I refused. The grounds which I gave for my refusal were simply that I knew nothing about the matter and that anyhow I would not allow myself to be forced into anything. Probably the former reason saved me from being thrown out right away. They probably thought that within a few days I might be converted or become more docile, but if they thought so, they were profoundly mistaken. After two weeks I found it utterly impossible for me to take such a step, even if I had been willing to take it at first.*

*At first, my resentment was aroused. At midday some, of my fellow, workers used to adjourn to the nearest tavern, while the others remained on the building premises and there ate their midday meal, which was in most cases a very scanty one. These were the married men whose wives brought them their midday soup in dilapidated vessels. Towards the end of the week there was a gradual increase in the number of those who remained to eat their midday meal on the building premises. I understood the reason for this afterwards. They now talked politics. I drank my bottle of milk and ate my morsel of bread somewhat apart from the others, while I circumspectly studied my environment or else fell to meditating on my own harsh lot. Yet I heard more than enough, and I often thought that much of what they said was meant for my ears, in the hope of making me adopt a definite attitude, but all that I heard had the effect of arousing the strongest antagonism in me. Everything was disparaged the nation, because it was held to be an invention of the ‘capitalist’ class (how often I had to listen to that phrase!); the Fatherland, because it was held to be an instrument in the hands of the bourgeoisie for the exploitation of the working classes; the authority of the law, because that was a means of oppressing the proletariat; the school system, as a means of training not only slaves, but also slave-drivers; religion, as a means of doping the people, in order to exploit them afterwards; morality, as the badge of stupid and sheepish docility. There was nothing that they did not drag in the mud.*

*Then a day came when the more redoubtable of my adversaries resorted to the most effective weapon they had to replace the force of reason, namely, intimidation and physical force. Some of the leaders among my adversaries ordered me to leave the building or else allow myself to be flung off the scaffolding. As I was quite alone I could not put up any effective resistance, so I chose the first alternative and departed, having, however, learned a lesson. I went away full of disgust, but at the same time so deeply moved that it was quite impossible for me to turn my back on the whole situation and think no more about it. When my anger began to calm down, the spirit of obstinacy got the upper hand and I decided that at all costs I would get back to work again, in the building trade. This decision became all the stronger a few weeks later, when my little savings had entirely run out and hunger clutched me once again in its merciless grip. I had no alternative. I got work again and had to leave for the same reasons as before. I tortured myself with the question, ‘Are these men worthy to belong to a great people?’ The question is profoundly disturbing, for if the answer is in the affirmative, then the struggle to defend one’s nationality is no longer worth all the trouble and sacrifice we demand of our best elements if it be on behalf of such a rabble. On the other hand, if the answer is in the negative, then our nation is poor in human material. After days spent in such meditation and introspection, I was depressed and saw before my mind’s eye the ever-increasing and menacing army of people who could no longer be reckoned as belonging to their own nation. It was with changed feelings, that, some days later, I gazed on the interminable ranks of Viennese workmen parading four abreast, at a mass demonstration. I stood dumbfounded for almost two hours, watching that enormous human dragon which slowly uncoiled itself there before me. When I finally left the square and wandered in the direction of my lodgings I felt dismayed and depressed.*

*On my way I noticed the Arbeiterzeitung (“The Workers’ Journal”) in a tobacco shop. This was the chief press-organ of the old Austrian Social Democracy. In a cheap cafe, where the common people used to forgather and where I often went to read the papers, the Arbeiterzeitung was also displayed. Hitherto I had not been able to bring myself to do more than glance at the wretched thing for a couple of minutes, for its whole tone was a sort of mental vitriol to me. Under the depressing influence of the demonstration I had witnessed, some interior voice urged me to buy the paper in that tobacco shop and read it through. So I took it home with me and spent a whole evening reading it, despite the steadily mounting rage provoked by this ceaseless outpouring of falsehoods. I now found that in the social democratic daily papers I could study the inner character of this movement much better than in all their theoretical literature.*  

- Page 44 (location ~ 673-680)    

*What a discrepancy between the two, between the literary effusions which dealt with the theory of Social Democracy and their high-sounding phraseology about liberty, human dignity and beauty, the air of profound wisdom, the disgusting moral pose and the brazen prophetic assurance—a meticulously woven glitter of words, to dazzle and mislead the reader and, on the other hand, the daily press spreading this new doctrine of human redemption in the most vile fashion! No means was too base, provided it could be exploited in the campaign of slander. These journalists were real virtuosos in the art of twisting facts and presenting them in a deceptive form. The theoretical literature was intended for the simpletons of the soi-disant intelligentsia of the middle and upper classes. The newspaper propaganda was intended for the masses. This probing into books and newspapers and the study of the teachings of Social Democracy reawakened my love for my own, people, and thus what at first seemed an impassable gulf became the occasion of a closer affection.*  

- Page 45 (location ~ 680-688)    

*The mentality of the broad masses is accessible only to what is strong and uncompromising. Like woman whose inner sensibilities are not under the sway of abstract reasoning, but are always subject to the influence of a vague emotional longing for the strength that completes her being, and who would rather bow to the strong man than dominate the weakling—in like manner the masses of the people prefer the ruler to the suppliant, and are well-led with a stronger sense of mental security by a teaching that brooks no rival, than by one which offers them a liberal freedom.*  

- Page 46 (location ~ 693-697)    

*If Social Democracy is opposed by a more truthful teaching, then, even though the struggle be of the most bitter kind, this truthful teaching will finally prevail, provided it be enforced with equal ruthlessness. Within less than two years I had gained a clear understanding of Social Democracy, its teaching and its weapons. I recognised the infamy of that technique whereby the movement carried on a campaign of mental terrorism against the bourgeoisie, which is neither morally nor spiritually equipped to withstand such attacks. The tactics of Social Democracy consisted in opening, at a given signal, a veritable barrage of lies and calumnies against the man whom they believed to be the most redoubtable of their adversaries, until the nerves of the bourgeoisie gave way and they sacrificed the man who was attacked, simply in the hope of being allowed to live in peace. But the hope always proved to be a foolish one for they were never left in peace. The same tactics were repeated again and again, until fear of these ruthless fanatics exercised, by sheer force of suggestion, a paralysing effect on their victims. Through its own experience, Social Democracy learned the value of strength and for that reason it attacks mostly those in whom it senses real mettle, which is indeed a very rare possession. On the other hand, it praises every weakling among its adversaries, more or less cautiously according to the measure of his mental qualities, known or assumed. They have less fear of a man of genius who lacks will-power, than of a vigorous character of mediocre intelligence, and at the same time they highly commend those who are devoid of both intelligence and will-power. The Social Democrats know how to create the impression that they alone are the protectors of peace. In this way, acting very circumspectly, but never losing sight of their ultimate goal, they conquer one position after another, at one time by methods of quiet intimidation, and at another, by sheer daylight robbery, employing these latter tactics at those moments when public attention is turned towards other matters from which it does not wish to be diverted, or when the public considers an incident too trivial to create a scandal and thus provoke the anger of a malignant opponent. These tactics are based on an accurate estimation of human frailties and must lead to success, with almost mathematical certainty, unless the other side also learns how to fight poison gas with poison gas. Weaker elements must be told that here it is a question of to be or not to be.*

*Then, of course, the Social Democratic Party will raise a horrified outcry and appeal to the authority of the State, which it has just repudiated and will, in most cases, quietly achieve its aim amid the general confusion, namely, to discover some bovine creature holding an important government position, who, in a vain attempt to curry favour with the dreaded opponent in case of future trouble, is ready to finish off those who dare to oppose this world enemy. The impression which such successful tactics makes on the minds of the broad masses, whether they be adherents or opponents, can be estimated only by one who knows the popular mind, not from books, but from practical life, for the successes which are thus obtained are taken by the adherents of Social Democracy as a triumph of the righteousness of their own cause; on the other hand, the beaten opponent very often loses faith in the effectiveness of any further resistance.*

*If I attempted to give a faithful picture of those on the lowest rung of the social ladder, my picture would be incomplete, if I did not add that even in the social depths I still found light in the shape of a rare spirit of self-sacrifice and loyal comradeship, contentment and a modest reserve. This was true especially of the older generation of workmen. Although these qualities were disappearing more and more in the younger generation, owing to the all-pervading influence of the big city, yet among the younger generation also, there were many who were fundamentally sound and who were able to maintain themselves uncontaminated amid the sordid surroundings of their everyday existence.*  

- Page 48 (location ~ 732-737)    

*When I was twenty years old I had learned to distinguish between the tradeunion as a means of defending the social rights of the employees and of fighting for better living conditions for them and, on the other hand, the tradeunion as a political instrument used by the party in the class struggle. The fact that the Social Democrats grasped the enormous importance of the tradeunion movement, secured for them a weapon which they used with success, whereas the bourgeois parties by their failure to understand it, lost their political prestige. They thought that their own arrogant ‘veto’ would arrest the logical development of the movement, but what they actually did was to produce an illogical development. It is absurd and also untrue to say that the tradeunion movement was in itself hostile to the nation.*  

- Page 50 (location ~ 758-763)    

*Like a threatening storm, the ‘free tradeunion’ hung above the political horizon and overshadowed the life of each individual, It was one of the most frightful instruments of terror that threatened the security and independence of the national economic structure, the stability of the State and the liberty of the individual. Above all, it was the ‘free tradeunion’ that turned democracy into a ridiculous term, insulted the ideal of liberty and derided that of fraternity with the slogan, ‘If you won’t become one of us, we’ll crack your skull.’*

*or enjoy ‘intimate experiences’ amid the stinking fumes of this literary Dadaism.*  

- Page 55 (location ~ 830-831)    

*For this purpose the official literature of the party was of little use. In discussing economic questions, its statements were false and its proofs unsound. In treating of political aims its attitude was insincere. Furthermore, its modern methods of chicanery in the presentation of its arguments were profoundly repugnant to me. Its flamboyant sentences, its obscure and incomprehensible phrases, pretended to contain great thoughts, but they were devoid of meaning. One would have had to be a decadent Bohemian in one of our modern cities in order to feel at home in that labyrinth of nonsense, or enjoy ‘intimate experiences’ amid the stinking fumes of this literary Dadaism. These writers were obviously counting on the proverbial humility of a certain section of our people, who believe that a person who is incomprehensible must be profoundly wise. By comparing the theoretical falsity and absurdity of that doctrine with the reality of its external manifestations, I gradually came to have a clear idea of its final aims. During such moments I had dark presentiments and feared something evil. I had before me a teaching inspired by egotism and hatred, calculated to win its victory, the winning of which would be a mortal blow to humanity.*

*It was not until I was fourteen or fifteen years old that I frequently ran up against the word ‘Jew,’ partly in connection with political controversies. These references aroused a slight aversion in me, and I could not avoid an uncomfortable feeling which always came over me when I had to listen to religious disputes. But, at that time, I did not see the Jewish question in any other light. There were very few Jews in Linz. In the course of centuries the Jews who lived there had become Europeanized and so civilised in appearance that I even looked upon them as Germans. The reason why I did not then perceive the absurdity of such an illusion was that the only thing which I recognised as distinguishing them from us was the practice of their strange religion. As I thought that they were persecuted on account of their faith my aversion to hearing remarks against them grew almost into a feeling of horror. I did not in the least suspect that there could be such a thing as systematic anti-Semitism. Such were the views I held when I went to Vienna. Confused by the mass of impressions I received from the architectural surroundings, and depressed by my own troubles, I did not at first distinguish between the different social strata of which the population of that mammoth city was composed. Although Vienna then had about two hundred thousand Jews among its population of two millions, I did not notice them.*  

- Page 56 (location ~ 846-856)    

*Not until I had gradually settled down in my new surroundings, and the confused picture began to grow clearer, did I gain a closer insight into my new world, and with that I came up against the Jewish problem. I will not say that the manner in which I first became acquainted with it was particularly pleasant. In the Jew I still saw a man who was of a different religion, and, therefore, on grounds of human tolerance, I was against the idea that he should be attacked because he had a different faith. Consequently I considered that the tone adopted by the anti-Semitic press in Vienna was unworthy of the cultural traditions of a great people. The memory of certain events which happened in the Middle Ages came to my mind, and I felt that I should not like to see them repeated. Generally speaking, these anti-Semitic newspapers were not regarded as belonging to the first rank (but I did not then understand the reason of this) and so I regarded them as the products of jealousy and envy rather than as the expression of a sincere, though wrong-headed, feeling.*  

- Page 56 (location ~ 858-865)    

*Once, when passing through the oldest part of the city, I suddenly encountered a creature in a long caftan and wearing black sidelocks. My first thought was, is this, then, a Jew? They certainly did not have this appearance in Linz. I watched the man stealthily and cautiously, but the longer I gazed at that strange countenance and examined it feature by feature, the more the question shaped itself in my brain, ‘Is this, then, a German?’ As was always my habit with such experiences, I turned to books for help in removing my doubts. For the first time in my life I bought myself some anti-Semitic pamphlets, for a few pence, but unfortunately they all began with the assumption that the reader had at least a certain degree of information on the Jewish question or was even familiar with it. Moreover, the tone of most of these pamphlets was such that I became doubtful again, because the statements made were partly superficial and the proofs extraordinarily unconvincing. For weeks, and indeed for months, I returned to my old way of thinking.*

*A great movement, called Zionism, the aim of which was to assert the national character of Judaism, was strongly represented in Vienna. To all outward appearances it seemed as if only one group of Jews championed this movement, while the great majority disapproved of it, or even repudiated it, but a closer investigation of the situation showed that since that part of Jewry which was styled ‘liberal’ did not disown the Zionists as if they were not member of their race, but rather as brother Jews who publicly professed their faith in an unpractical, and even, dangerous way, there was no real rift in their internal solidarity. This fictitious conflict between the Zionists and the ‘liberal’ Jews soon disgusted me; for it was false through and through and therefore in direct contradiction to the moral dignity and immaculate character on which that race had always prided itself.*

*One ought to realise that for one Goethe, Nature may bring into existence ten thousand such scribblers who act as the worst kind of germ-carriers in poisoning human soul. It was a terrible thought, and yet one which could not be overlooked, that the greater number of the Jews seemed specially destined by Nature to play this shameful part. Was it for this reason that they were called the chosen people? I then began to investigate carefully the names of all the fabricators of these unclean products which played such a big part in the cultural life of the public. The result of that investigation was still more unfavourable to the attitude which I had hitherto held in regard to the Jews. Though my feelings might rebel a thousand times, reason now had to draw its own conclusions.*

Though my feelings might rebel a thousand times, reason now had to draw its own conclusions. The fact that nine-tenths of all the ‘smutty’ literature, artistic ‘tripe’ and theatrical banalities, had to be charged to the account of a people who formed scarcely one percent of the nation could not be gainsaid. It was there and had to be admitted. Then I began to examine my favourite ‘world press,’ with that fact before my mind. The deeper I probed, the more did the object of my former admiration lose its glory. Its style became still more repellent and I was forced to reject its subject-matter as entirely shallow and superficial. Its impartial attitude in the presentation of facts and views seemed to me to contain more falsehood than truth. The writers were—Jews.*  

- Page 62 (location ~ 949-960)    

*To whose interest was this? Or was it mere chance? In attempting to find an answer to these questions I gradually became more and more dubious. The process was hastened by glimpses which I gained of another aspect of the case, namely, the general conception of manners and morals which was openly upheld and put into practice by a large section of the Jews. Here again the life which I observed in the streets taught me by living example. The part which the Jews played in the evil of prostitution, and more especially in the white slave traffic, could be studied here better than in any other Western European city, with the possible exception of certain ports in Southern France. Walking by night along the streets of the Leopoldstadt, almost at every turn, whether one wished it or not, one witnessed certain incidents of which the majority of Germans knew nothing until the War made it possible, and indeed inevitable, for the soldiers to see such things on the Eastern front. A cold shiver ran down my spine when I first ascertained that it was the cold-blooded and shameless Jew who showed his consummate skill in conducting a sordid and vicarious trade among the dregs of the big city. Then I was filled with wrath. I had now no more hesitation about investigating the Jewish problem in all its details. Henceforth, I was determined to do so, but as I learned to track down the Jew in all the different spheres of cultural and artistic life, and in the various manifestations of this life everywhere, I suddenly came upon him where I had least expected to find him.*  

- Page 64 (location ~ 967-979)    

*In my relations with my fellow-workmen I was often astonished to find how easily and how often they changed their opinions on the same question, sometimes within a few days and sometimes even within the course of a few hours. I found it difficult to understand how men, who always had reasonable ideas when I spoke to them as individuals, suddenly lost this reasonableness the moment they came under the influence of the mass. I was often on the verge of despair. When, after talking to them for hours, I was convinced that I had, at last broken the ice or made them see the error of their way of thinking, and was sincerely pleased, I would often find to my disgust that next day I had to begin all over again. All my efforts had been in vain. With pendulum-like regularity they swung back to their original opinions.*

*gradually discovered that the Social Democratic press was mainly controlled by Jews, but I did not attach special importance to this circumstance, for the same was true of other newspapers. In this connection there was, however, one striking fact, namely, that there was not a single newspaper with which Jews were connected that could be spoken of as ‘national’ in the sense that I, with my education and convictions, used that word. Making an effort to overcome my natural reluctance, I tried to read articles published in the Marxist press. However, as my aversion increased tenfold, I set about learning something of the people who wrote and published this mischievous stuff—from the publisher downwards, all of them were Jews! I got hold of as many Social Democratic pamphlets as I could and looked up the names of the authors—Jews all! I noted the names of nearly all their leaders and most of them belonged to the chosen race, whether they were members of the Reichsrat (Imperial Council), tradeunion secretaries, chairmen of various organisations or street agitators. Everywhere the same sinister picture presented itself. I shall never forget the list of names—Austerlitz, David, Adler, Ellenbogen, and others. One fact became quite evident to me, namely, that this alien race held in its hand the leadership of that Social Democratic Party with whose minor representatives I had been disputing for months past. I was happy at last to know for certain that the Jew was not a German. Thus I learnt to know thoroughly those who were leading our people astray. One year in Vienna had sufficed to convince me that no worker is so rooted in his preconceived notions that he will not surrender them in face of better and clearer arguments and explanations. Gradually I became an expert in the doctrine of the Marxists and used this knowledge as an instrument to drive home my own firm convictions. I was successful in nearly every case.*

*If your arguments were so telling that your adversary felt forced to give in on account of those listening and if you then thought that at last you had gained ground, a surprise was in store for you on the following day. The Jew would be utterly oblivious to what had happened the day before, and he would start once again by repeating his former absurdities, and if nothing had happened. Should you become indignant and remind him of yesterday’s defeat, he pretended astonishment and could not remember anything, except that on the previous day he had proved that his statements were correct. Sometimes I was dumbfounded. I do not know what amazed me the more —their quickness in repartee or the artful way in which they dressed up their falsehoods. I gradually came to hate them. Yet all this had its good side, because the better I came to know the real leaders, or at least the propagators of Social Democracy, the more did my love for my own people increase accordingly. Considering the satanic skill which these evil counsellors displayed, who could blame their unfortunate victims? Indeed, I found it extremely difficult to prove a match for the dialectic perfidy of that race. How futile was it to try to win over such people, seeing that they distorted the truth, denied the very words they had just uttered and used them again a few moments afterwards to serve their own ends in argument!*

*May it not be that this people which lives only for the things of this earth has been promised the earth as a reward? Have we, from the objective point of view, a right to fight for self-preservation, or is this right subjective? Fate answered the question for me inasmuch as it led me to make a detached and exhaustive inquiry into the Marxist teaching and the activities of the Jewish people in connection with it. The Jewish doctrine of Marxism repudiates the aristocratic principle of Nature and substitutes for the eternal right of might and strength, the dead weight of sheer numbers. Thus it denies the individual worth of the human personality, disputes the teaching that nationality and race are of primary significance, and by doing this deprives Man of the very foundations of his existence and civilisation. If the Marxist teaching were to be accepted as the foundation of the life of the universe, it would lead to the disappearance of all order that is conceivable to the human mind, and thus the adoption of such a law would provoke chaos in the structure of the greatest organism that we know, with the result that the inhabitants of this earthly planet would finally disappear. Should the Jew, with the aid of his Marxist creed, triumph over the peoples of this world, his crown will be the funeral, wreath of mankind, and this planet will once again follow its orbit through ether, devoid of human life, as it did millions of years ago.*

*Dr. Lueger, however, in his role as Mayor of the Imperial Capital and Residential City, had achieved so much in almost every sphere of municipal activity, whether economic or cultural, that the heart of the whole Empire throbbed with renewed vigour and he thus proved himself a much greater statesman than the socalled ‘diplomats’ of that period. The fact that this political conglomeration of heterogeneous races called Austria, finally broke down, is no evidence whatsoever of political incapacity on the part of the German element in the old Ostmark. The collapse was the inevitable result of an impossible situation. Ten million people cannot permanently hold together a State of fifty millions, composed of different and conflicting nationalities, unless certain definite conditions are fulfilled before it is too late. The German-Austrian possessed vision. Accustomed to live in a great Empire, he had a keen sense of the obligations incumbent on him in such a situation. He was the only member of the Austrian State who looked beyond the borders of the narrow lands belonging to the Crown, to the frontiers of the Reich.*  

- Page 74 (location ~ 1126-1134)    

*The German played the foremost part in carrying on the foreign trade of the country, as far as that sphere of activity was not under Jewish control. He was the political cement that held the State together. His military duties carried him far beyond the narrow frontiers of his homeland. Though the recruit might join a German regiment, that regiment was as likely to be stationed in Herzegovina as in Vienna or Galicia. The officers in the Habsburg armies were still Germans and so was the majority in the higher branches of the civil service. Art and science were in German hands. Apart from the new artistic trash, which might easily have been produced by a Negro tribe, all genuine artistic inspiration came from the German section of the population. In music, architecture, sculpture and painting, Vienna was the source which supplied the entire Dual Monarchy, and that source never seemed to show signs of drying up. Finally, it was the German element that determined the conduct of foreign, policy, though a small number of Hungarians were also active in that field. All efforts to save the State were, however, doomed to end in failure, because the essential prerequisites were missing. There was only one possible way to controlling and holding in check the centrifugal forces of the different and differing nationalities in the Austrian State. Either it had a central government and was, at the same time, internally organised, or it would cease to exist.*  

- Page 75 (location ~ 1141-1152)    

*It was impossible to make anything like a successful effort for the permanent consolidation of the Austrian State unless a ruthless and persistent policy of centralisation were put into force. Before all, by the adoption, as a matter of principle, of one language as the official language of the State, the purely formal unity of the latter should have been emphasised, and thus the administration would have had in its hand that technical instrument without which the State could not endure as a political unity. Only if this had been done, could the schools and other forms of education have been used to inculcate a feeling of common citizenship. Such an objective could not be reached within ten or twenty years, but the effort would have to be envisaged in terms of centuries, just as, in all problems of colonisation, steady perseverance is a far more important element than intensive effort for a short period of time. It goes without saying that in such circumstances the country must be governed and administered by strict adhesion to the principle of uniformity. For me, it was quite instructive to discover why this did not take place, or rather, why it had not been done. Those who were guilty of the omission must be held responsible for the break-up of the Habsburg Empire. More than any other State, the old Austria depended on a strong and capable government. The Habsburg Empire lacked ethnical uniformity, which constitutes the fundamental basis of a national State and will preserve the existence of such a State even though the ruling power be grossly inefficient. When a State is composed of a homogeneous population, the natural inertia of the latter and the powers of resistance derived from that inertia will preserve it from internal collapse during astonishingly long periods of misgovernment and maladministration. It may often seem as if the life had died out of such a body-politic; but a time comes when the apparent corpse rises up and, gives the rest of the world astonishing proof of its indestructible vitality. The situation is utterly different in a country where the population is not homogeneous, where there is no bond of common blood, but only the rule of force. Should the ruling hand show signs of weakness in such a State, the result will not be to cause a kind of hibernation of the State, but rather to awaken the individualistic instincts of the various racial groups. These instincts do not make themselves felt as long as these groups are dominated by, a strong central will-to-govern. The danger which exists in these slumbering separatist instincts can be rendered more or less innocuous only through centuries of common education, common traditions and common interests.*

*They may be only dormant and may suddenly awaken when the central government shows weakness and the force of a common education as well as the dignity of a common tradition prove unable to withstand the vital energies of separatist nationalities forging ahead towards the shaping of their own individual existence. Failure to see the truth of all this constituted what may be called the tragic guilt of the Habsburg rulers. Only in the case of one Habsburg ruler, and that for the last time, did the hand of Destiny hold aloft the torch that threw light on the future of his country, but, thereafter the torch was then extinguished for ever. Joseph II, who ruled over the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation, was filled with a growing anxiety when he realised the fact that his House had been pushed to an outlying frontier of the Reich and that the time would soon be at hand when it would be overturned and engulfed in the whirlpool caused by that Babel of nationalities, unless something was done at the eleventh hour to overcome the dire consequences resulting from the negligence of his ancestors. With superhuman energy this ‘Friend of Mankind’ made every possible effort to counteract the effects of the carelessness and thoughtlessness of his predecessors. Within one decade he strove to repair the damage that had been done throughout the centuries.*

*The following considerations also influenced my attitude: The fate of the German element in the Austrian State depended on its position in the Reichsrat. Up to the time that universal suffrage by secret ballot was introduced, the German representatives had a majority in the parliament, though that majority was not a very substantial one. This situation gave cause for anxiety because the Social Democratic faction could not be relied upon when national questions were at stake. In matters that were of critical concern for the German element, the Social-Democrats always took up an anti-German stand, because they were afraid of losing their followers among the other national groups. Even at that time the Social-Democratic party could no longer be considered as a German party. The introduction of universal suffrage put an end even to the purely numerical predominance of the German element. The way was now clear for the further ‘de-Germanisation’ of the Austrian State. The national instinct of self-preservation made it impossible for me to welcome a representative system in which the German element was not really represented as such, but was always betrayed. Yet all these, and many others, were defects which could not be attributed to the parliamentary system as such, but rather to the Austrian State in particular.*

*Thus I had the opportunity of hearing with my own ears what I had been hitherto acquainted with only through reading the newspapers—a turbulent mass of people, all gesticulating and bawling together, with a pathetic old man ringing his bell and making frantic efforts to call the House to a sense of its dignity, by friendly appeals, exhortations, and grave warnings. I could not refrain from laughing. Several weeks later I paid a second visit. This time the House presented an entirely different picture, so much so that one could hardly recognise it as the same place. The hall was practically empty. The very atmosphere was sleepy, only a few members were in their places, yawning in each other’s faces. One was speaking. A deputy speaker was in the chair. When he looked round it was quite plain that he felt bored. Then I began to reflect seriously on the whole thing. I went to the parliament whenever I had any time to spare and watched the spectacle silently, but attentively. I listened to the debates, as far as they were intelligible, and I studied the more or less intelligent features of those ‘elect’ representatives of the various nationalities which composed that ill-fated State. Gradually I formed my own ideas about what I saw. A year of such quiet observation was sufficient to transform, or completely destroy, my former opinion as to the character of this parliamentary institution. I no longer opposed merely the perverted form which the principle of parliamentary representation had assumed in Austria. It had become impossible for me to accept the system in itself. Up to that time I had believed that the disastrous, deficiencies of the Austrian parliament were due to the lack of a German majority, but now I recognised that the institution itself was wrong in its very essence and character.*

*Democracy, as practised in Western Europe to-day, is the forerunner of Marxism. In fact, the latter would not be conceivable without the former. Democracy is the breeding ground in which the bacilli of the Marxist world-pest can grow and spread. By the introduction of parliamentarianism, democracy produced an abortion of ‘filth and fire,’ the fire of which, however, seems to have died out. I am more than grateful to Fate that this problem came to my notice when I was still in Vienna, for if I had been in Germany at that time, I might easily have found only a superficial solution. If I had been in Berlin, when I first discovered what a ridiculous thing this institution was, which we called parliament, I might easily have gone to the other extreme and believed (as many people believed, and apparently not without good reason) that the salvation of the people and the Reich could be secured only by restrengthening the principle of imperial authority.*

*Does anybody honestly believe that human progress originates in the composite brain of the majority and not in the brain of the individual? Or, is it presumed that in the future, human civilisation will be able to dispense with this as a condition of its existence? Is not the creative brain of the individual more indispensable to-day than ever before? The parliamentary principle of vesting legislative power in the decision of the majority rejects the authority of the individual and puts in its place the strength of the majority in question. In doing so, it contradicts the aristocratic principle, which is a fundamental law of Nature, but of course, we must remember that the aristocratic principle need not be exemplified by the upper ten thousand to-day. The devastating influence of this modem and democratic parliamentary institution might not easily be recognised by those who read the Jewish press, unless the reader has learned how to think independently and to examine the facts for himself.*

*is another sign of our decadence that the number of eminent statesmen grows as the standard by which the individual is judged becomes lower, and that standard will fall the more the individual politician has to depend upon parliamentary majorities. A man of real political ability will refuse to act the lackey to a bevy of footling tacklers, and they, in their turn, being the representatives of the majority—which means the dunder-headed multitude—hate nothing so much as a superior brain. It is always a consolation to such village councillors from Gotham to be led by a person whose intellectual stature is on a level with their own. Thus each one may have the opportunity to shine in debate among such compeers and, above all, each one feels that he may one day rise to the top. If Peter be boss to-day, then why not Paul tomorrow?*  

- Page 88 (location ~ 1346-1352)    

*One truth which must always be borne in mind is that the majority can never replace the man. The majority represents not only ignorance but also cowardice, and just as a hundred blockheads do not equal one man of wisdom, so a hundred poltroons are incapable of taking any political line of action that requires moral strength and fortitude. The lighter the burden of responsibility on each individual leader, the greater will be the number of those who, in spite of their sorry mediocrity, will feel the call to place their immortal talents at the: disposal of the nation. They are so much on the tip-toe of expectation that they find it hard to wait their turn. They stand in a long queue, painfully and sadly counting the number of those ahead of them and calculating the hours until, they can eventually come forward. They are delighted every time the holder of the office on which they have set in their hearts, is changed and they are grateful for every scandal which removes one of the aspirants waiting ahead of them in the queue. If somebody sticks too long to his office stool they consider this almost a breach of a sacred understanding based on their mutual solidarity. They grow furious and do not rest until that inconsiderate person is finally driven out and forced to hand over his cosy berth. After that he will have little chance of getting another opportunity.*

*In such people the qualities of statesmanship were measured and valued according to the adroitness with which they pieced together one coalition after another, in other words, to their craftiness is manipulating the pettiest political transactions, which is the only kind of practical activity by means of which these men can prove themselves to be suitable representative of the people. In this sphere Vienna was the school which offered the most impressive examples. Another feature that engaged my attention quite as much was the contrast between the talents and knowledge of these representatives of the people, on the one hand, and, on the other, the nature of the tasks they had to face. Willy-nilly one could not help thinking seriously of the narrow intellectual outlook of these chosen representatives of the various constituent nationalities, and one could not avoid pondering on the methods by which these noble figures in our public life were first discovered. It was worth while to make a thorough study and examination of the way in which the real talents of these gentlemen were devoted to the service of their country; in other words, to analyse thoroughly the routine of their activities. The whole spectacle of parliamentary life became more and more*

*While still a young man in Vienna, I had excellent opportunities for getting to know the men who owned this machine for mass instruction, as well as those who supplied it with the ideas it propagated. At first I was quite surprised when I realised how little time was necessary for this dangerous ‘Great Power’ within the State to produce a certain belief among the public— even when the genuine will and convictions of the public were completely misconstrued. It took the press only, a few days to transform some ridiculously trivial matter into an issue of national importance, while vital problems were completely ignored or shelved and hidden away from public attention.*  

- Page 93 (location ~ 1415-1419)    

*order to estimate properly the really pernicious influence which the press can exercise one has only to study this infamous Jewish method whereby honourable and decent people are besmirched with mud and filth, in the form of low abuse and slander, from hundreds of quarters simultaneously, as if in response to some magic formula. These intellectual pickpockets would grab at anything which might serve their evil ends. They would poke their noses into the most intimate family affairs and would not rest until they had sniffed out some petty item which could be used to destroy the reputation of their unfortunate victim. But if the result of all this nosing should be that nothing derogatory was discovered in the private or public, life of the victim, they resorted to slander, in the belief that some of their animadversions would stick, even though refuted a thousand times. In most cases it finally turned out impossible for the victim to continue his defence, because the accuser worked together with so many accomplices that his slanders were re-echoed interminably.*  

- Page 93 (location ~ 1425-1433)    

*When these slanderers gathered together in large numbers at meetings and congresses they would utter a lot of slimy talk about a special kind of honour which they called the ‘professional honour of the journalist.’ Then the assembled species would bow their respects to one another. This is the kind of being that fabricates more than two-thirds of what is called public opinion, from the foam of which the parliamentary Aphrodite eventually arises. Several volumes would be needed if one were to give an adequate account of the whole procedure and fully describe all its hollow fallacies, but if we pass over the details, and look at the product itself and its activities, I think this alone will be sufficient to open the eyes of even the most innocent and, credulous person; so that he may recognise the absurdity of this institution by looking at it objectively.*  

- Page 94 (location ~ 1436-1442)    

*Nobody, I hope, is foolish enough to pretend that hundreds of statesmen can emerge from papers placed in the ballot-box by electors who are anything but intelligent. The absurd notion that men of genius are born out of universal suffrage cannot be too strongly repudiated. A nation produces a genuine statesman once in the space of many years, and never by the hundred. Secondly, among the broad masses there is an instinctive antipathy towards every outstanding genius. There is a better chance of seeing a camel pass through the needle’s eye than of seeing a really great man ‘discovered’ through an election.*  

- Page 96 (location ~ 1459-1463)    

*The most important economic measures are submitted to a tribunal in which not more than one-tenth of the members have studied the elements of economics. This means that final authority is vested in men who are utterly devoid of any preparatory training which would make them competent to decide on the questions at issue. The same holds true of every other problem. It is always a majority of ignorant and incompetent people who decide on each measure, for the composition of the institution does not vary, while the problems to be dealt with extend to the most varied spheres of public life and would actually require to be weighed and settled by a continually changing body of representatives. It is out of the question to think that the same people are fitted to decide on transport questions as well as, let us say, on questions of foreign policy, unless each of them be a universal genius, but scarcely more than one genius appears in the course of a century.*  

- Page 96 (location ~ 1471-1478)    

*Measures of momentous importance for the future existence of the State are framed and discussed in an atmosphere more suited to the card-table. Indeed the latter suggests a much more fitting occupation for these gentlemen than that of deciding the destiny of a people. Of course it would be unfair to assume that each member in such a parliament originally possessed such a slight sense of responsibility. That is not so, but this system, by forcing the individual to pass judgment on questions which he is not competent to decide gradually debases his moral character. Nobody will have the courage to say, “Gentlemen, I am afraid we know nothing of what we are talking about. I, for one, admit this.” Anyhow, if such a declaration were made it would not change matters very much, for such outspoken honesty would not be understood and such an honourable fool ought not to be allowed to spoil the game. Those who have a knowledge of human nature know that nobody likes to be considered a fool by his associates, and in certain circles honesty is taken as an index of stupidity.*

*The feeling that, if the individual refrained from taking part in a certain decision, his attitude would not alter the situation in the least, destroys every real honest instinct which might occasionally prick the conscience of one person or another. Finally, the otherwise upright deputy will succeed in persuading himself that he is by no means the worst of the lot and that, by taking part in a certain line of action, he may prevent something worse from happening. A counter-argument may be put forward here. It may be said that of course the individual member may not have the knowledge which is requisite for the treatment of this or that question, yet his attitude towards it is taken on the advice of his party as the guiding authority in each political matter; and it may further be said that the party sets up special committees of experts who have even more than the requisite knowledge for dealing with the questions placed before them. At first sight, that argument seems sound. But then another question arises, namely, why are five hundred persons elected, if only a few have the wisdom which is required to deal with the more important problems? That is just the point. It is not the aim of our modern democratic parliamentary system to bring together an assembly of intelligent and well-informed deputies. Not at all. The aim is rather to bring together a group of nonentities who are dependent on others for their point of view and who can be the more easily led, the narrower their individual mental outlook.*  

- Page 98 (location ~ 1491-1503)    

*In practice, no actual responsibility remains, for responsibility arises only from personal duty and not from the obligations that rest with a parliamentary assembly of empty talkers. The parliamentary institution attracts people of the badger type, who shun the light. Any upright man, who is ready to accept personal responsibility for his actions, will despise such an institution. That is the reason why this brand of democracy has become a tool in the hands of that race which, because of its secret aims, must shun the light, as it always has done and always will do. Only a Jew can praise an institution which is as corrupt and as false as himself. As a contrast to this kind of democracy we have the Germanic democracy, which is a true democracy, for here the leader is freely chosen and is obliged to accept full responsibility for all his actions and omissions.*

*In the Reichsrat it was always the German element that suffered through the system, which meant that the results were detrimental to the Empire as a whole, for at the close of the century even the most simple-minded people could recognise that the cohesive forces within the Dual Monarchy no longer sufficed to counterbalance the separatist tendencies of the provincial nationalities. On the contrary, as the measures which the State was able to adopt for its own preservation became more and more ineffectual the general contempt for the State increased. Not only Hungary, but also the various Slav provinces, gradually ceased to identify themselves with the monarchy which embraced them all and, accordingly, they did not feel its weakness as in any way detrimental to themselves. They rather welcomed these manifestations of senile decay. They looked forward to the final dissolution of the State, and not to its recovery. In the parliament the complete collapse was postponed by the humiliating concessions that were made to every kind of importunate demand at the expense of the German element; while, throughout the country, it was staved off by playing off the various nationalities one against another.*

*After the great war of 1870–71 the House of Habsburg set to work fully determined to exterminate slowly and deliberately (for that was bound to be the result of the Slavophile policy) the dangerous German element about whose inner feelings and attitude there could be no doubt. Then the fire of rebellion blazed up among the people whose extermination had been decreed—a fire such as had never been witnessed in modem German history. For the first time nationalists and patriots were transformed into rebels; not rebels against the nation or the State as such but rebels against a form of government which, they were convinced, would inevitably bring about the ruin of their own people. For the first time in modem history the traditional dynastic patriotism and national love of Fatherland and people were in open conflict.*

*The authority of the State can never be an end in itself; for, if that were so, any kind of tyranny would be inviolable and sacred. If a government uses the instruments of power in its hands for the purpose of leading a people to ruin, then rebellion is not only the right, but also the duty, of every individual citizen. The question of whether and when such a situation arises cannot be answered by theoretical dissertations, but only by sheer force and success. Every government, even though it may be the worst possible and even though it may have betrayed the nation’s trust in thousands of ways, will claim that its duty is to uphold the authority of the State. Its adversaries, who are fighting for national self-preservation, must use the same weapons which the government uses if they are to prevail against such a rule and secure their own freedom and independence. Therefore the conflict will be fought out with ‘legal’ means as long as the power which is to be overthrown uses them; but the insurgents will not hesitate to apply illegal means if the oppressor himself employs them.*

*Austria affords a very clear and striking example of how easy it is for tyranny to hide its head under the cloak of what is called ‘legality.’ The legal exercise of power in the Habsburg State was then based on the anti-German attitude of the parliament, with its non-German majorities, and on the dynastic House, which was also hostile to the German element. The whole authority of the State was incorporated in these two factors. To attempt to alter the lot of the German element through these two factors would have been senseless. Those who advocated the ‘legal’ way as the only possible way, and also obedience to the State authority, could offer no resistance; because a policy of resistance could not have been put into effect through legal measures. To follow the advice of the legalist counsellors would have meant the inevitable ruin of the German element within the Monarchy, and this disaster would not have been long in coming. The German element was actually saved only by the collapse of the State as such. The spectacled theorist would have given his life for his doctrine rather than for his people. Because man has made laws, he subsequently comes to think that he exists for the sake of those laws. A great service rendered by the Pan-German movement then was that it abolished all such nonsense, though the doctrinaire theorists and other fetish worshippers were shocked.*

*Herein lay Dr. Lueger’s special talent. He had a rare gift of insight into human nature and he was very careful not to take men as something better than they were in reality. He based his plans on the practical possibilities which human life offered him, whereas Schönerer had very little understanding of this. All the ideas that this Pan-German protagonist had were right in the abstract, but he did not have the forcefulness or understanding necessary to convey his ideas to the broad masses. He was not able to formulate them so that they could be easily grasped by the masses, whose powers of comprehension are limited and will always remain so. Therefore, all Schönerer’s knowledge was only the wisdom of a prophet and he never succeeded in putting it into practice. This lack of insight into human nature led him to form a wrong estimate of certain movements and old institutions. Schönerer realised, indeed, that the problems he had to deal with were in the nature of a Weltanschauung; but he did not understand that only the broad masses of a nation can make such convictions, which are almost of a religious nature, prevail.*  

- Page 107 (location ~ 1635-1643)    

*Generally speaking, a Weltanschauung can have no prospect of success, unless the broad masses declare themselves ready to act as its champion and to fight on its behalf wherever and to whatever extent that may be necessary. This failure to understand the importance of the lower strata of the population resulted in a very inadequate conception of the social problem. In all this Dr. Lueger was the opposite of Schönerer. His profound knowledge of human nature enabled him to form a correct estimate of the various social forces and it saved him from underrating the power of existing institutions, It was perhaps this very quality which enabled him to utilise those institutions as a means to serve the purposes of his policy. He saw only too clearly that, in our epoch, the political fighting power of the upper classes is quite insignificant and not at all capable of fighting for the triumph of a great new movement.*

*His extremely wise attitude towards the Catholic Church rapidly won over the younger clergy in such large numbers that the old clerical party was forced to retire from the field of action or else, and this was the wiser course, join the new party, in the hope of gradually winning back one position after another. It would be a serious injustice to the man if we were to regard this as his essential characteristic, for he possessed not only the qualities of an able tactician, but had the true genius of a great reformer although this was limited by his exact perception of the possibilities at hand and also of his own capabilities. The aims which this really eminent man decided to pursue were intensely practical. He wished to conquer Vienna, the heart of the Monarchy. It was from Vienna that the last pulses of life beat through the diseased and worn-out body of the decrepit Empire. If the heart could be made healthier, the other parts of the body were bound to revive. That idea was correct in principle, but the time within which it could be applied in practice was strictly limited, and that was Lueger’s weak point. His achievements as Burgomaster of the City of Vienna are immortal, in the best sense of the word, but all that could not save the Monarchy. It came too late.*  

- Page 109 (location ~ 1658-1667)    

*In my opinion, the wreck of the Pan-German movement in Austria must be attributed to three causes. The first of these consisted in the fact that the leaders did not have a clear concentration of the importance of the social problem, particularly for a new movement which had an essentially revolutionary character. Schönerer and his followers directed their attention principally to the bourgeois classes. For that reason, their movement was bound to turn out mediocre and tame. The German bourgeoisie, especially in its upper circles, is —though the individual may not be aware of this—pacifist even to the point of complete self-abnegation wherever the internal affairs of the nation or State are concerned.*  

- Page 110 (location ~ 1674-1679)    

*Such was the fate of the Pan-German movement, because at the start the leaders did not realise that the most important condition of success was that they should recruit their following from the broad masses of the people. The movement thus became bourgeois and respectable and radical only in moderation. The second cause of its rapid decline was due to this mistake. The position of the Germans in Austria was already desperate when Pan-Germanism arose. Year by year parliament was being used more and more as an instrument for the gradual extinction of the German-Austrian population. The only hope of an eleventh-hour effort to save it lay in the overthrow of the parliamentary system, but there was very little prospect of this happening. Consequently, the Pan-German movement was confronted with a question of primary importance. To overthrow the parliament, should the Pan-Germanists have entered it ‘to undermine it from within,’ as the current phrase was? Or should they have assailed the institution as such from outside? They entered the parliament and came out defeated, but they had been obliged to enter it, for in order to wage an effective war against such a power from the outside, indomitable courage and a ready spirit of sacrifice were necessary.*  

- Page 111 (location ~ 1690-1700)    

*The worst aspect of the case was that the Pan-German movement could hope for success only if the leaders realised from the very first moment that here it must be less a question of a new party than of a new Weltanschauung. This alone could arouse the inner moral forces that were necessary for such a gigantic struggle, and in this struggle the leaders must be men of first-class brains and indomitable courage. If the struggle on behalf of a Weltanschauung is not conducted by men of heroic spirit who are ready to sacrifice everything, within a short while it will become impossible to find real fighting followers who are ready to lay down their lives for the cause. A man who fights only for his own existence has not much interest left for the service of the community. In order to secure the conditions that are necessary for success, everybody concerned must be made to understand that the new movement looks to the future for its honour and glory, but that it has no contemporary reward to offer its members.*  

- Page 114 (location ~ 1737-1744)    

*If a movement should offer a large number of positions and offices that are easily accessible, the number of unworthy candidates admitted to membership will be constantly on the increase, and eventually a day will come when there will be such a preponderance of political profiteers among the membership of a successful party that the combatants who bore the brunt of the battle in the earlier stages of the movement can now scarcely recognise their own party and may be thrown overboard by the later arrivals as unwanted ballast. Then the movement will no longer have a mission to fulfil. Once the Pan-German party decided to collaborate with parliament they were no longer leaders and combatants in a popular movement, but merely parliamentarians. Thus the movement sank to the common political party level of the day and had no longer the strength to face a hostile fate and run the risk of martyrdom. Instead of fighting, the Pan-German leaders fell into the habit of talking and negotiating The new parliamentarians soon found that it was a more satisfactory, because less risky, way of fulfilling their task, if they were to defend the new Weltanschauung with the ‘intellectual’ weapon of parliamentary rhetoric rather than risk their lives in a struggle, the outcome of which was*

*If a movement should offer a large number of positions and offices that are easily accessible, the number of unworthy candidates admitted to membership will be constantly on the increase, and eventually a day will come when there will be such a preponderance of political profiteers among the membership of a successful party that the combatants who bore the brunt of the battle in the earlier stages of the movement can now scarcely recognise their own party and may be thrown overboard by the later arrivals as unwanted ballast. Then the movement will no longer have a mission to fulfil. Once the Pan-German party decided to collaborate with parliament they were no longer leaders and combatants in a popular movement, but merely parliamentarians. Thus the movement sank to the common political party level of the day and had no longer the strength to face a hostile fate and run the risk of martyrdom. Instead of fighting, the Pan-German leaders fell into the habit of talking and negotiating The new parliamentarians soon found that it was a more satisfactory, because less risky, way of fulfilling their task, if they were to defend the new Weltanschauung with the ‘intellectual’ weapon of parliamentary rhetoric rather than risk their lives in a struggle, the outcome of which was uncertain and could, at best, offer no prospect of personal gain for themselves.*

*The broad masses of a population are more susceptible to the appeal of rhetoric than to any other force. All great movements are popular movements. They are the volcanic eruptions of human passions and emotions, stirred into activity by the ruthless goddess of Adversity or by the torch of the spoken word cast into the midst of the people. In no case have great movements been set afoot by the syrupy effusions of aesthetic litterateurs and drawing-room heroes. The doom of a nation can be averted only by a storm of glowing passion; but only those who are passionate themselves can arouse passion in others. It is only through the capacity for passionate feeling that chosen leaders can wield the power of the word which, like blows from a hammer, will open the door to the hearts of the people. He who is not capable of passionate feeling and speech was never chosen by Providence to be the herald of its will. Therefore, a writer should stick to his ink-bottle and busy himself with theoretical questions, if he has the requisite ability and knowledge. He was not born or chosen to be a leader.*  

- Page 116 (location ~ 1772-1781)    

*There was a third mistake, which also had its roots in the failure to understand the significance of the broad masses. The masses are first set in motion, in a definite direction, by men of superior talents; but then these masses, once in motion, are like a flywheel inasmuch as they sustain the momentum and steady balance of the offensive. The policy of the Pan-German leaders in deciding to carry through a difficult fight against the Catholic Church can be explained only by attributing it to an inadequate understanding of the spiritual character of the people. The reasons why the new party engaged in a violent campaign against Rome were as follows: As soon as the House of Habsburg had definitely decided to transform Austria into a Slav state, all sorts of measures were adopted which seemed suitable for that purpose. The Habsburg rulers had no scruples of conscience about exploiting even religious institutions in the service of this new ‘State idea.’ One of the many methods employed was the use of Czech parishes and their clergy as instruments in the Slavisation of Austria, which was carried out in the following way. Parish priests of Czech nationality were appointed to purely German districts. Gradually and steadily pushing the interests of the Czech people before those of the Church, the parish priests became generative cells in the process of de-Germanisation.*  

- Page 118 (location ~ 1799-1809)    

*It was undoubtedly true that the national powers of resistance, in everything concerning Germanism as such, were much weaker among the German Catholic clergy, than among their non-German colleagues, especially the Czechs, and only an ignorant person could be unaware of the fact that it scarcely ever entered the minds of the German clergy to take the offensive on behalf of German interests.*

At the same time, everybody who is not blind to facts must admit that all this should be attributed to a characteristic under which we Germans are all doomed to suffer. This characteristic shows itself in our objective attitude towards our own nationality, as towards other things.*  

- Page 120 (location ~ 1829-1834)    

*We observe the same phenomenon wherever it is a matter of standing up for some abstract idea. ‘The authority of the State,’ ‘democracy,’ ‘pacifism,’ ‘international solidarity,’ etc., all such notions become rigid, dogmatic conceptions with us, so that the general vital needs of the nation are judged purely in the light of these conceptions. This unfortunate habit of looking at all national demands from the point of view of a preconceived notion makes it impossible for us to see the subjective side of a thing which objectively contradicts our own doctrine. It finally leads to a complete reversal of the relation of means and end. Any attempt at a national revival will be opposed, if the preliminary condition of such a revival be that a bad and pernicious regime must first of all be overthrown, because such an action will be considered as a violation of the ‘authority of the State.’ In the eyes of those who take that standpoint, the ‘authority of the State’ is not a means which is there to serve an end, but rather, to the mind of the dogmatic believer in objectivity, an end in itself, which suffices as the whole purpose of his own miserable existence.*  

- Page 121 (location ~ 1845-1854)    

*Protestantism violently opposes every attempt to rescue the nation from the clutches of its mortal enemy, because the Protestant attitude towards the Jews is more or less rigidly and dogmatically fixed. And yet this is the first problem which has to be solved, unless all attempts to bring about a German renascence are doomed to turn out ridiculous and impossible. During my sojourn in Vienna I had ample leisure and opportunity to study this problem without allowing, any prejudices to intervene, and in my daily intercourse with people I was able to test in a thousand ways the correctness of the opinion I had formed. Here, at the meeting-place of many nationalities, it was obvious that it was always the German pacifist who tried to consider the interests of his own nation objectively, but you would never find a Jew who adopted a similar attitude towards his own race. Furthermore, I found that only the German Socialist is ‘international’ in the sense that he feels himself obliged not to demand justice for his own people in any other manner than by whining and wailing to his international comrades.*  

- Page 123 (location ~ 1881-1890)    

*Therefore, the first theoretical argument advanced by the Pan-German leaders, in support of their offensive against Catholicism was quite untenable. The only way to remedy the evil of which I have been speaking is to train the Germans from youth upwards to an absolute recognition of the rights of their own people, instead of poisoning their minds, while they are still children, with the virus of this cursed ‘objectivity,’ even in matters concerning the very preservation of our own existence. The result of this would be that the Catholic in Germany, just as in Ireland, Poland or France, will be a German first and foremost, but this presupposes the establishment of a radical national government. The strongest proof in support of my contention is furnished by what took place when our people were called for the last time before the tribunal of History to defend their own existence, in a life-and-death struggle. As long as there was no lack of leadership in the higher circles, the people fulfilled their duty and obligations to an overwhelming extent. Whether Protestant pastor or Catholic priest, each did his very utmost to help our powers of resistance to hold out, not only in the trenches, but also, and to an even greater degree, at home.*

*Nothing could be more to the taste of one of these parliamentary loungers and tricksters than to be able to find a scapegoat at least, after the event, for his political sharp practice. The moment religion or a religious denomination is attacked and made responsible for his personal misdeeds, this shrewd fellow will raise an outcry at once and call the world to witness how justified he was in acting as he did, proclaiming that he and his eloquence alone have saved religion and the Church. The public, which is mostly stupid and has a very short memory, is not capable of recognising the real instigator of the quarrel in the midst of the turmoil that has been raised. Frequently it does not remember the beginning of the fight and so the rogue gains his end. A cunning fellow of that sort is quite well aware that his misdeeds have nothing to do with religion, and so he will laugh up his sleeve all the more heartily when his honest, but artless, adversary loses the game and, one day losing all faith in humanity, retires from public life. But also from another point of view it would be wrong to make religion, or the Church as such, responsible for the misdeeds of individuals.*  

- Page 125 (location ~ 1914-1923)    

*If it be objected that here we are concerned not with the petty problems of everyday life, but principally with fundamental truths and questions of dogma, the only way of answering that objection is to ask the question, ‘Do you feel that Providence least called you to proclaim the Truth to the world?’ If so, then go and do it, but you ought to have the courage to do it directly and not use some political party as your mouthpiece, for this, too, would be false. In the place of something that now exists and is bad, put something else that is better and will last into the future. If you lack the requisite courage, or if you yourself do not know clearly what your better self ought to be, leave the whole thing alone but, whatever happens, do not try to reach the goal by the roundabout way of a political party if you are not brave enough to fight with your visor lifted. Political parties have no right to meddle in religious questions except when these relate to something that is alien to the nation and thus calculated to undermine racial customs and morals. In the same way, religion must not be mixed up with party politics. If some ecclesiastical dignitaries should misuse religious institutions or religious teachings to injure their own ration, their opponents ought never to take the same road and fight them with the same weapons. To a political leader, the religious teachings and institutions of his people should be sacred and inviolable; otherwise, he should not be a statesman, but a reformer, if he has the necessary qualities for such a mission.*

*Their struggle against the Catholic Church made their position impossible in numerous circles among the lower and middle classes, while at the same time it robbed them of innumerable high-class elements some of the best indeed that the nation possessed. The practical outcome of the Austrian Kulturkamp was negative. Although they succeeded in wresting one hundred thousand members from the Church, that did not do much harm to the latter. The Church did not need to shed tears over these lost sheep, for it lost only those who had for a long time ceased to belong to it in their inner hearts. The difference between this new reformation and the great Reformation was that, at that time, some of the best members left the Church because of religious convictions, whereas in this new reformation only those left who had been indifferent before and who were now influenced by political considerations. From the political point of view alone, the result was a ridiculous as it was deplorable. Once again a political movement which had promised so much for the German nation collapsed, because it was not conducted in a spirit of unflinching adherence to naked reality, but lost itself in spheres in which it was bound to be broken up.*  

- Page 128 (location ~ 1949-1958)    

*Nothing in the policy of a political party is so fraught with danger as allowing its decisions to be directed by people who want to have their fingers in every pie though they do not know how to cook the simplest dish. Even though there is much that can be said against the various religious denominations, political leaders must not forget that history teaches us that no purely political party in similar circumstances ever succeeded in bringing about a religious reformation. One does not study history for the purpose of forgetting its lessons afterwards, when the time comes to apply them, or of imagining that in this particular case things are different, so that the eternal truths of history are no longer applicable. One learns history in order to be able to apply its lessons to the present time and whoever fails to do this cannot pretend to be a political leader. In reality he is quite a superficial person or, as is mostly the case, a conceited simpleton whose good intentions cannot make up for his incompetence. The art of leadership, as displayed by really great leaders of the people throughout the ages, consists in concentrating the attention of the people against a single adversary and taking care that nothing will divide that attention. The more the militant energies of the people are directed towards one objective, the greater will be its magnetic force and its striking power. The leader of genius must have the ability to make different opponents appear as if they belonged to one category, for weak and wavering natures among a leader’s following may easily begin to be dubious about the justice of their own cause if they have to face several enemies. As soon as the vacillating masses find themselves facing an opposition that is made up of different groups of enemies, their sense of objectivity will be aroused and they will ask how it is that all the others can be in the wrong and they themselves, and their movement, alone in the right.*  

- Page 128 (location ~ 1962-1976)    

*The anti-Semitism of the Christian-Socialists was based on religious, instead of racial, principles. The reason for this mistake also gave rise to the second error. The founders of the Christian-Socialist party were of the opinion that they could not base their attitude on the racial principle if they wished to save Austria, because they felt that a general disintegration of the State might quickly result from the adoption of such a policy. In the opinion of the party chiefs, the situation in Vienna demanded that all factors which tender to estrange the nationalities from one another should be carefully avoided and that all factors making for unity should be emphasised. At that time Vienna was so honeycombed with foreign elements, especially Czech, that the greatest amount of tolerance was necessary if these elements were to be enlisted in the ranks of any party that was not anti-German on principle.*  

- Page 130 (location ~ 1994-2000)    

*On such superficial grounds it was impossible to deal with the whole problem in an earnest and rational way. The consequence was that many people could not understand this kind of anti-Semitism and therefore refused to take part in it. The attractive force of the idea was thus restricted exclusively to narrow-minded circles, because the leaders failed to go beyond the mere emotional appeal and did not ground their position on a truly rational basis. The intellectuals were opposed to such a policy on principle. It looked more and more as if the whole movement were a new attempt to proselytize the Jews or, on the other hand, as if it were merely organised from a wish to compete with other contemporary movements. Thus the struggle lost all traces of having been organised for a spiritual and sublime mission. Indeed, it seemed to some people—and these were by no means worthless elements—to be immoral and reprehensible. The movement failed to awaken a belief that here there was a problem of vital importance for the whole of humanity, on the solution of which the destiny of the whole non-Jewish world depended. Through this shilly-shallying way of dealing with the problem, the anti-Semitism of the Christian-Socialists turned out to be quite ineffective. It was anti-Semitic only in outward appearance which was worse than if it had made no pretence at all to anti-Semitism, for the pretence gave rise to a false sense of security among people who believed that the enemy had been brought to bay, but, as a matter of fact, these people themselves were being led by the nose. The Jew readily adjusted himself to this form of anti-Semitism and found its continuance more profitable to him than its abolition would have been. This whole attitude led to great sacrifices being made for the sake of that State which was composed of many heterogeneous nationalities, but much greater sacrifices had to be made by the representatives of the German element. It was impossible to adopt a ‘nationalist’ attitude for fear of losing the foothold gained in Vienna itself. It was hoped that the Habsburg State might be saved by a silent evasion of the nationalist question, but it was this very policy that brought that State to ruin.*  

- Page 131 (location ~ 2006-2023)    

*The Pan-German party was perfectly right in its fundamental ideas regarding the aim of the movement, which was to bring about a German renascence, but it was unfortunate in its choice of means. It was nationalist, but unfortunately it paid too little heed to the social problem, and thus it failed to gain the support of the masses. Its anti-Jewish policy, however, was grounded on a correct perception of the significance of the racial problem and not on religious principles, but it was a mistake, and wrong from a tactical point of view to make war on one religious denomination. The Christian-Socialist movement had only a vague conception of a German revival as part of its object, but it was intelligent and fortunate in the choice of means to carry out its policy as a party. The Christian-Socialists grasped the significance of the social question, but they adopted the wrong principles in their struggle against Jewry, and they utterly failed to appreciate the power of the national idea. Had the Christian-Socialist party, apart from its shrewd estimate of the value of the broad masses, also gauged correctly the importance of the racial problem (which was properly grasped by the Pan-German movement) and had this party been really nationalist, or if the Pan-German leaders, on the other hand, in addition to their correct handling of the Jewish problem and of the national idea, had adopted the practical standpoint of the Christian-Socialist Party, and particularly their attitude towards Socialism—then a movement would have developed which, in my opinion, might even at that time have successfully altered the course of German history.*

*I came more and more to lead what may be called a twofold existence. Reason and reality forced me to continue to endure my harsh, but beneficial, experience in Austria, but my heart was elsewhere. A feeling of discontent grew upon me and made one depressed the more I came to realise the inside hollowness of this State and the impossibility of saving it from collapse. At the same time I felt perfectly certain that it would bring all kinds of misfortune on the German people. I was convinced that the Habsburg State would baulk and hinder every German who might show signs of real greatness, while at the same time it would aid and abet every non-German activity.*

This conglomerate spectacle of heterogeneous races which the capital of the Dial Monarchy presented, this motley of Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Ruthenians, Serbs and Croats, etc., and always that bacillus which is the solvent of human society, the Jew, here and there and everywhere—the whole spectacle was repugnant to me. The gigantic city seemed to be the incarnation of racial adulteration.*  

- Page 135 (location ~ 2060-2068)    

*Because my heart was always with the German Reich and not with the Austrian Monarchy, the hour of Austria’s dissolution as a State appeared to me only as the first step towards the emancipation of the German nation. All these considerations intensified, my yearning to depart for that country for which my heart had been secretly longing since the days of my youth. I hoped that one day I might be able to make my mark as an, architect and that I could devote my talents to the service of my country on a large, or on a small scale, according to the will of Fate. A final reason was that I longed to be among those who lived and worked in that land from which the movement should be launched, the object of which would be the fulfilment of what my heart had always longed for, namely, the union of the country in which I was born with our common Fatherland, the German Reich. There are many who may not understand how such a yearning can be so strong, but I appeal especially to two groups of people. The first includes all those who are denied the happiness I have spoken of, and the second embraces those who once enjoyed that happiness, but have had it torn from them by a harsh fate. I turn to all those who have been torn from their mother-country and who have to struggle for the preservation of their most sacred patrimony, their native language, who are persecuted and, because of their loyalty and love for the homeland, yearn sadly for the hour when they will be allowed to return to the bosom of their mother country. To these I address my words, and I know that they will understand. Only he who has himself experienced what it means to be a German and yet to be denied the right of belonging to his Fatherland, can appreciate the profound nostalgia which that enforced exile causes.*

*I do not know what my attitude towards Jewry, Social Democracy, or rather Marxism, in general, to the social problem, etc., would be to-day if I had not acquired a stock of personal beliefs at such an early age, by dint of hard study and under the duress of Fate. For, although the misfortunes of the Fatherland may have stimulated thousands to ponder over the inner causes of the collapse, that could not lead to such a thorough knowledge and deep insight as a man develops who has fought a hard struggle; for many years in order that he might be master of his own fate.*

*One must know Munich if one would know Germany, and it is impossible to acquire a knowledge of German art without seeing Munich. All things considered, this pre-war sojourn was by far the happiest and most contented time of my life. My earnings were very slender, but after all, I did not live for the sake of painting. I painted in order to get the bare necessities of existence while I continued my studies. I was firmly convinced that I should finally succeed in reaching the goal I had marked out for myself, and this conviction alone was strong enough to enable me to bear the petty hardships of everyday life without worrying very much about them.*  

- Page 138 (location ~ 2102-2107)    

*The official attitude of German diplomacy, as well as that of the general public, towards internal problems affecting the Austrian nationalities was not merely stupid, it was insane. On the alliance, as on a solid foundation, they grounded the security and future existence of a nation of seventy millions, while, at the same time, they allowed their partner to continue his policy of undermining the sole foundation of that alliance, methodically and resolutely, from year to year. A day must come when nothing but a formal contract with Viennese diplomats would be left. The alliance itself, as an effective support, would be lost to Germany. As far as concerned Italy, such had been the case from the outset. If people in Germany had studied history and the psychology of nations a little more carefully, not one of them could have believed for a single hour that the Quirinal and the Viennese Hofburg could ever stand shoulder to shoulder on a common battle-front.*

*To the individual who always sees only himself and not the race, this line of action seems more humane and just than the opposite way, but unfortunately, the consequences are also the reverse. By leaving the process of procreation unchecked and by submitting the individual to the hardest preparatory tests in life, Nature selects the best from an abundance of single elements and stamps them as fit to live and carry on the conservation of the species. Man restricts the procreative faculty and strives obstinately to keep alive at any cost whatever has once been born. This correction of the Divine Will seems to him to be wise and humane, and he rejoices at having trumped Nature’s card in one game at least and thus proved that she is not entirely reliable. This little ‘masterpiece’ made by the Almighty does not like to be told that, although he has succeeded in limiting numbers, his system leads to degeneration in the quality of the individual, for, as soon as the procreative faculty is thwarted and the number of births diminished, the natural struggle for existence, which allows only healthy and strong individuals to survive; is replaced by a sheer craze to ‘save’ feeble, and even diseased, creatures at any cost. Thus are sown the seeds of a human progeny which will become more and more enfeebled from one generation to another, as long as Nature’s will is scorned. If this policy is carried out, the final result will always be that such a nation will eventually terminate its own existence on this earth; for, though man may defy the eternal laws of procreation for a certain period, vengeance will follow sooner or later.*  

- Page 144 (location ~ 2201-2213)    

*It is certainly true that the productivity of the soil can be increased to a certain extent, but only within definite limits and not indefinitely. By increasing the productive powers of the soil, it will be possible to balance the effect of a surplus birth-rate in Germany for a certain period of time, without incurring any danger of famine. But we have to face the fact that the general standard of living is rising more quickly than even the birth-rate. Our demands as regards food and clothing are growing from year to year and are out of all proportion to those of our ancestors of, let us say, a hundred years ago. It would, therefore, be a mistake to assume that every increase in the productive powers of the soil will supply the requisite conditions for an increase in the population. That is true up to a certain point only, for at least a portion of the increased produce of the soil will be consumed in supplying the increased demands caused by the steady rise in the standard of living. But even if these demands were to be curtailed to the narrowest limits possible, and if, at the same time, we were to use all our available energies in intensive cultivation, we should here reach a definite limit which is conditioned by the inherent nature of the soil itself.*  

- Page 145 (location ~ 2219-2228)    

*The first phenomenon will be the recurrence of famine periods from time to time, after bad harvests, etc. The intervals between these famines will become shorter and shorter, the more the population increases, and finally, the famine times will disappear only in those rare years of plenty when the granaries are full. A time, will ultimately come when, even in those years of plenty, there will not be enough to go round, so that hunger will dog the footsteps of the nation. Nature must now step in once more and select those who are to survive; or else man will help himself by artificially preventing his own increase, with all the fatal consequences to the race and the species which have already been mentioned. It may be objected here that, in one form or another, this future is in store for all mankind and that the individual nation or race cannot escape the general fate. At first glance, that objection seems logical enough; but we have to take the following into account. The day will certainly come when the whole of mankind will be forced to check the augmentation of the human species, because there will be no further possibility of adjusting the productivity of the soil to the perpetual increase in the population. Nature must then be allowed to use her own methods, or man may possibly take the task of regulation into his own hands and establish the necessary equilibrium by the application of better means than we have at our disposal to-day.*  

- Page 146 (location ~ 2230-2241)    

*Nature knows no political frontiers. She begins by establishing life on this globe and then watches the free play of forces. Those who show the greatest courage and industry are the children nearest to her heart and they will be granted the sovereign right of existence. If a nation confines itself to ‘internal colonisation’, while other races are perpetually increasing their territorial possessions all over the globe, that nation will be forced to restrict the numerical growth of its population at a time when the other nations are increasing theirs. This situation must eventually arise, and it will arise soon if the territory which the nation has at its disposal be small. Now, it is unfortunately true that only too often the best nations—or, to speak more exactly, the only really cultured nations, who at the same time are the chief champions of human progress—have decided, in their blind pacifism, to refrain from the acquisition of new territory and to be content with ‘internal colonisation.’*  

- Page 147 (location ~ 2245-2253)    

*A time will come, even though in the distant future, when there can be only two alternatives—either the world will be ruled according to our modern concept of democracy, and then every decision will be in favour of the numerically stronger races; or the world will be governed by the law of natural distribution of power, and then those nations will be victorious who are more brutal of will and they will not be the nations who have practised self-denial. Nobody can doubt that this world will one day be the scene of dreadful struggles for existence on the part of mankind. In the end the instinct of self-preservation alone will triumph; before its consuming fire this socalled humanitarianism, which connotes only a mixture of fatuous timidity and self-conceit, will melt away as snow in the March sunshine. Man has become great through perpetual struggle. In perpetual peace his greatness must decline. For us Germans the slogan of ‘internal colonisation’ is fatal, because it encourages the belief that we have discovered a means which is in accordance with our innate pacifism and which will enable us to work for our livelihood by leading a drowsy existence. Such a teaching, once it were taken seriously by our people, would mean the end of all effort to acquire for ourselves that, place in the world which we deserve.*  

- Page 148 (location ~ 2258-2267)    

*Once we know what the consequences of this ‘internal colonisation’ theory would be, we can no longer consider as a mere accident the fact that, among those who inculcate this pernicious theory upon the minds of our people, the Jew is always in the; first rank. He knows his audience too well not to know that they are ready to be the grateful victims of every swindler who promises them a fortune in the shape of a discovery that will enable them to outwit Nature and thus render superfluous the hard and inexorable struggle for existence so that finally they may become lords of the Earth partly by sheer dolce far niente and partly by work, just as it happens. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that any German ‘internal colonisation’ must first of all be considered as suited only for the relief of social grievances, and in particular, for freeing the soil from the grip of the speculator, but that such a system could never suffice to assure the future of the nation, without the acquisition of new territory.*  

- Page 149 (location ~ 2271-2279)    

*Therefore, the problem was: A policy of territorial expansion or a colonial and commercial policy? Both policies were taken into consideration, examined, recommended and, rejected, from various standpoints, with the result that the second alternative was finally adopted. The sounder alternative, however, was undoubtedly the first. The principle of acquiring new territory, on which the surplus population could be settled, has many advantages to recommend it, especially if we take the future, rather than the present, into account. In the first place, too much importance cannot be attached to the necessity for adopting a policy which will make it possible to maintain a, healthy farmer class as the basis of the national community. Many of our present evils have their origin exclusively in the disproportion between the urban and rural portions of the population. A solid stock of small and medium farmers have at all times been the best protection which a nation could have against the social diseases that are prevalent to-day. Moreover, that is the only solution which guarantees the daily bread of a nation within the framework of its domestic national economy.*  

- Page 151 (location ~ 2303-2311)    

*Thus, industry and commerce would no longer constitute the basis of the national subsistence, but would be auxiliary institutions. By fulfilling their proper function, which is to adjust the balance between national production and national consumption, they render national subsistence more or less independent of foreign countries and thus assure the freedom and independence of the nation, especially at critical junctures in its history. Such a territorial policy, however, cannot be carried out in the Cameroons, but, almost exclusively, here in Europe. One must calmly and squarely face the truth that it certainly cannot be part of the dispensation of Divine Providence to give to onto nation a fifty times larger share of the surface of this globe than to another. In considering this state of affairs to-day, one must not allow existing political frontiers to distract attention from those frontiers which, on the principle of eternal justice, ought to exist. If there is sufficient ‘living space’ for all on this earth, then we ought to be given our share of the soil which is absolutely necessary for our existence, but of course nobody will be prepared to do so.*

*It may be said that they have the apex in Europe and the base of the pyramid all over the world very different from the United States of America, which has its base on the American Continent and is in contact with the rest of the world only through its apex. Out of that situation arises the incomparable inner strength of the U.S.A. and the contrary situation is responsible for the weakness of most of the European colonial Powers. Britain cannot be suggested as an argument against this assertion, since faced with the British Empire, one is inclined to overlook the existence of the Anglo-Saxon world as such. Britain’s position cannot be compared with that of any other State in Europe, since together with the U.S.A. it forms a vast community of language and culture. Therefore, the only possibility which Germany had of carrying into effect a sound territorial policy of expansion was that of acquiring new territory in Europe itself. Colonies cannot serve this purpose as long as they are not suited for settlement by Europeans on a large scale. In the nineteenth century it was no longer possible to acquire such colonies by peaceful means. Therefore, any attempt at such a colonial expansion would have meant an enormous military struggle. Consequently, it would, have been more practical to undertake that military struggle for new territory in Europe, rather than to wage war for the acquisition of possessions abroad.*

*Let us suppose that in 1904, our German foreign policy was managed astutely enough to enable us to play the part which Japan played. It is not easy to measure the greatness of the results that might have accrued to Germany from such a policy. There would have been no World War. The blood which would have been shed in 1904 would not have been one tenth of that shed between and 1918, and what a position Germany would hold in the world to-day! In any case, the alliance with Austria would then have been an absurdity, for this mummy of a State did not attach itself to Germany for the purpose of carrying through a war, but rather to maintain a perpetual state of peace which was meant to be exploited for the purpose of slowly but persistently exterminating the German element in the Dual Monarchy. Another reason for the impossibility of forming this alliance was that nobody could expect this State to take an active part in defending German national interests, as long as it did not have sufficient strength and determination to put an end to the policy of de-Germanisation just beyond its own frontiers.*

*Nothing was, dreaded so much as the possibility of an armed conflict; but finally, and at a most unfavourable moment, the conflict had to be faced. Germany thought to cut herself loose from the cords of Destiny, but Destiny held her fast. She dreamt of maintaining a world peace and woke up to find herself in a world war. That dream of peace was a most significant reason why the above-mentioned third alternative for the future development of Germany was not even taken into consideration. The fact was recognised that new territory could be gained only in the east of Europe, but this meant that there would be fighting ahead, whereas Germany wanted peace at any cost. The slogan of German foreign policy had altered from ‘Preservation of the German nation at all costs’ to ‘Preservation of world-peace at any price.’ We know what the result was. I shall resume the discussion of this point in detail later on. There remained still another alternative, which we may call the fourth, namely, industry and world trade, naval power and colonies.*

Such a development might certainly have been achieved more easily and more rapidly. To colonise a territory is a slow process, often extending over centuries. Yet this fact is the source of its inner strength; for it is not through a sudden burst of enthusiasm that it can be put into effect, but rather through a gradual and enduring process of growth quite different from industrial progress, which can be artificially speeded up within a few years. The result thus achieved, however, is not of lasting quality but something frail, like a soap-bubble. It is much easier to build a fleet quickly than to carry through the tough task of settling a territory with farmers and establishing farmsteads, but the former is also more quickly destroyed than the latter.*

*At the close of the century the alliance with Austria had become a veritable absurdity from all points of view, but nobody thought of forming an alliance with Russia against Britain, just as nobody thought of making Britain an ally against Russia, for in either case, the final result would inevitably have been war, and to avoid war was the very reason why a commercial and industrial policy was decided upon. It was believed that the peaceful conquest of the world by commercial means provided a method which would permanently supplant the policy of, force. Occasionally, however, there were doubts about the efficacy of this principle, especially when some quite incomprehensible warnings were now and again uttered by Britain. That was the reason why the fleet was built. It was not for the purpose of attacking or annihilating Britain, but merely to defend the concept of world peace, mentioned above, and also to defend the principle of conquering the world by ‘peaceful’ means. Therefore this fleet was kept within such limits as made it inferior to the British fleet, not only as regards the number and tonnage of the vessels, but also in regard to their armament, the idea being to furnish new proofs of peaceful intentions. The chatter about the peaceful conquest of the world by commercial means was probably the most completely nonsensical stuff ever raised to the dignity of a guiding principle in the policy of a State.*

*The Slav element would have preferred to smash up the Dual Monarchy in 1914 rather than permit it to come to the assistance of Germany, but at that time there were only a few who understood all the dangers and difficulties which resulted from the alliance with the Danubian Monarchy. In the first place, Austria had too many enemies who were eagerly looking forward to obtaining the heritage of that decrepit State and who gradually developed a certain animosity against Germany, because Germany was an obstacle to their desires inasmuch as she kept the Dual Monarchy from falling to pieces, an event that was hoped for on all sides. The conviction developed that Vienna could be reached only via Berlin. In the second place, by adopting this policy Germany lost her best and most promising chances of other alliances. In place of these possibilities one now observed a growing tension in her relations with Russia and even with Italy, and this in spite of the fact that the general attitude in Rome was just as favourable to Germany as it was hostile to Austria—a hostility which lay dormant in the individual Italian and broke out violently on occasion. Since a commercial and industrial policy had been adopted, no motive was left for waging war against Russia. Only the enemies of the two countries, Germany and Russia, could, in these circumstances, have an active interest in such a war. As a matter of fact, it was only the Jews and the Marxists who tried to stir up bad blood between the two States.*

*Once again the ‘uninitiated’ layman could do nothing but look on while the ‘elect’ headed straight for disaster enticing their beloved people to follow them, as the rats followed the Pied Piper of Hamelin. If we would look for the deeper grounds which made it possible to foist on the people this absurd notion of peacefully conquering the world through commercial penetration, and ask how it was possible to put forward the maintenance of world-peace as a national aim, we shall find that these grounds lay in the general morbid condition of German political thought. The triumphant progress of technical science in Germany and the marvellous development of German industry and commerce led us to forget that a powerful State had been the necessary prerequisite of that success. On the contrary, certain circles even went so far as to give vent to the theory that the State owed its very existence to these phenomena; that it was, above all, an economic institution and should be constituted in accordance with economic interests. Therefore, it was held, the State was dependent on the economic structure. This condition of things was looked upon and glorified as the soundest and most normal.*

*The State is a community of living beings who have kindred physical and spiritual natures, organised for the purpose of ensuring the conservation of their own kind and fulfilling those ends which Providence has assigned to that particular race or racial branch. Therein, and therein alone, lies the purpose and meaning of a State. Economic activity is one of the many auxiliary means which are necessary for the attainment of those aims. But economic activity is never the origin or purpose of a State, except where a State has, from the outset, been founded on a false and unnatural basis. This alone explains why a State as such does not necessarily need a certain delimited territory as a condition of its foundation. This condition becomes a necessary prerequisite only among those people who would provide and assure subsistence for their kinsfolk through their own industry, which means that they are ready to carry on the struggle for existence by means of their own work. People who can sneak their way, like parasites, into the bosom of other nations, and make others work for them on various pretences, can form a State without possessing any definite delimited territory.*

People who can sneak their way, like parasites, into the bosom of other nations, and make others work for them on various pretences, can form a State without possessing any definite delimited territory. This is chiefly applicable to that parasitic race which, particularly at the present time, preys upon the honest portion of mankind; I mean the Jews. The Jewish State has never been delimited in space. It has been spread all over the world, without any frontiers whatsoever, and has always been constituted from the membership of one race exclusively. That is why the Jews have always formed a State within the State. One of the most ingenious tricks ever devised has been that of sailing the Jewish ship of state under the flag of religion and thus securing that tolerance which Aryans are always ready to grant to different religious faiths. The Mosaic Law is really nothing else than the doctrine of the preservation of the Jewish race and, therefore, includes all spheres of sociological, political and economic science which have a bearing on the main end in view. The instinct for the preservation of one’s own species is the primary cause that leads to the formation of human communities. Hence, the State is a racial organism, and not an economic organisation. The difference between the two is so great as to be incomprehensible to our contemporary socalled ‘statesmen.’ That is why they like to believe that the State can be built up on an economic basis, whereas the truth is that it has always resulted from the exercise of those qualities which are part of the will to preserve the species end the race.*  

- Page 165 (location ~ 2515-2535)    

*Und setzet ihr nicht das Leben ein, Nie wird euch das Leben gewonnen sein. (And if you do not stake your life, You will never win life for yourself.) The sacrifice of the individual existence is necessary in order to assure the conservation of the race. Hence it is that the most essential condition for the establishment and maintenance of a State is a certain feeling of solidarity, grounded in an identity of character and race and in a readiness to defend these at all costs. With people who live on their own territory this will result in a development of the heroic virtues; with a parasitic people it will develop into hypocrisy and perfidious cruelty, unless we admit that these characteristics are innate and that the varying political forms through which the parasitic race expresses itself are only the outward manifestation of innate characteristics. At least in the beginning, the formation of a State can result only from a manifestation of the heroic qualities I have mentioned, and the people who fail in the struggle for existence, that is to say, those who become vassals and are thereby condemned to disappear entirely sooner or later, are those who do not display the heroic virtues in the struggle, or those who fall victims to the, perfidy of the parasites.*

*Whenever the political power of Germany was especially strong the economic situation also improved, but whenever economic interests alone occupied the foremost place in the life of the people, and thrust ideals into the background, the State collapsed and economic ruin soon followed. If we consider the question of what those forces actually are which are necessary for the creation and preservation of a State, we can sum them up in the phrase, ‘the capacity and readiness of the individual to sacrifice himself for the common welfare.’ That these qualities have nothing at all to do with economics can be proved by referring to the simple fact that man does not sacrifice himself for material interests. In other words, he will die for an ideal, but not for a business. The marvellous gift of public psychology which the English possess was never better shown than in the way in which they presented their case in the World War. We were fighting for our bread; but the English declared that they were fighting for ‘freedom,’ and not even for their own freedom, but for the freedom of the small nations.*

*Our clever ‘statesmen’ were greatly amazed at this change of feeling. They never understood that as soon as man is called upon to struggle for purely material causes he will avoid death as best he can, for death and the enjoyment of the material fruits of a victory are quite incompatible concepts. The frailest woman will become a heroine when the life of her own child is at stake, and only the will to save their race and native land or the State, which offers protection to their race, has, throughout the ages, been the urge which has forced men to face the weapons of their enemies. The following may be proclaimed as a truth that always holds good: A State has never arisen from commercial causes for the purpose of peacefully serving commercial ends. States have always arisen from the instinct to maintain the racial group, whether this instinct manifest itself in the heroic sphere or in the sphere of cunning and chicanery. In the first instance we have the Aryan States, based on the principle of work and cultural development; in the second, we have the Jewish parasitic colonies. As soon as economic interests begin to predominate over the racial and cultural instincts of a people or a State, these economic interests become the disintegrating cause that leads to subjugation and oppression.*

The belief, which prevailed in Germany before the War, that the world could be opened up and even conquered for Germany through a system of peaceful commercial penetration and a colonial policy, was a typical symptom which indicated the decline of those real qualities whereby States are created and preserved, and indicated also the decline of that insight, will-power and practical determination which go with those qualities. The World War, with its consequences, was the natural outcome of that decline. To anyone who had not thought over the matter deeply, this attitude of the German people—which was quite general—must have seemed an insoluble enigma. After all, Germany herself was a magnificent example of an empire that had been built up purely by a policy of power.*

*The tempest of historical achievements seemed to have permanently subsided, so much so, that the future appeared to be irrevocably delivered over to what was called peaceful competition between the nations. This simply meant a system of mutual exploitation by fraudulent means, the principle of resorting to the use of force in self-defence being formally excluded. Individual countries increasingly assumed the appearance of commercial undertakings, grabbing territory, clients and concessions from each other under any and every kind of pretext, and it was all carried out to the accompaniment of loud but innocuous shouting.*

*The salesmen could be represented by the English and the administrative functionaries by the Germans; whereas the Jews would have to sacrifice themselves and be content with the unprofitable calling, of proprietorship, for they are constantly avowing that they make no profits and are always being called upon to ‘pay out.’ Moreover, they have the advantage of being versed in foreign languages. Why could I not have been born a hundred years ago, I used to ask myself, somewhere about the time of the Wars of Liberation, when a man was still of some value even though he had no ‘business?’ Thus I used to think it an ill-deserved stroke of bad luck that I had arrived too late on this terrestrial globe and I felt chagrined at the idea that my life would have to run its course along peaceful and orderly lines. As a boy I was anything but a pacifist and all attempts to make me so turned out futile. Then the Boer War came, like a flash of lightning on the far horizon. Day after day, I used to gaze intently at the newspapers and I almost ‘devoured’ the telegrams and communiques, overjoyed to think that I could witness that heroic struggle, even though from so great a distance.*

*When the news came to Munich that the Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been murdered, I had been at home all day and did not learn the particulars of how it happened. At first, I feared that the shots had been fired by some German-Austrian students who had been aroused to a state of furious indignation by the persistent pro-Slav activities of the heir to the Habsburg throne and therefore wished to liberate the German population from this internal enemy. It was quite easy to imagine what the result of such a mistake would have been. It would have brought on, a new wave of persecution, the motives of which would have been ‘justified’ before the whole world, but soon afterwards I heard the names of the presumed assassins and learned also that they were known to be Serbs. I felt somewhat dumbfounded in face of the inexorable vengeance which Destiny had wrought. The*

*No effort whatsoever was made to locate the carefully prepared sting which lay hidden in this glorifying praise. One fact which was entirely overlooked, perhaps intentionally, was that the more the Empire remained dependent on the socalled administrative talent of ‘the wisest monarch of all times,’ the more catastrophic would be the situation when Death came to knock at the door and demand its tribute. Was it possible even to imagine the Austrian Empire without its venerable ruler? Would not the tragedy which befell Maria Theresia be repeated at once? It is unjust to governmental circles in Vienna to reproach them with having instigated a war which might have been prevented. The war was bound to come. Perhaps it might have been postponed for a year or two at the most, but it had always been the misfortune of German as well as of Austrian diplomats that they endeavoured to put off the inevitable day of reckoning, with the result, that they were finally compelled to deliver their blow at a most inopportune moment.*  

- Page 175 (location ~ 2671-2679)    

*The consequences of this folly had now to be borne. What came was bound to come and in no circumstances could it have been avoided. The fault of the German Government lay in the fact that, merely for the sake of preserving peace at all costs, they continued to miss the occasions that were favourable for action, got entangled in an alliance for the purpose of preserving the peace of the world, and thus finally became the victim of a world coalition which opposed the German effort for the maintenance of peace and was determined to bring about the World War. Had the Austrian Government of that time formulated its ultimatum in less drastic terms, that would not have altered the situation at all, except inasmuch as they themselves might have become the victims of public indignation, for, in the eyes of the great masses, the ultimatum was toe moderate and certainly not excessive or brutal. Those who would deny this today are either simpletons with feeble memories or else deliberate falsehood-mongers.*  

- Page 176 (location ~ 2688-2695)    

*The war of 1914 was certainly not forced on the masses; it was even desired by the whole people. There was a desire to bring the general feeling of uncertainty to an end once and for all. And it is only in the light of this fact that we can understand how more than two million German men and youths voluntarily joined the colours, ready to shed the last drop, of their blood for the cause. For me those hours came as a deliverance from the distress that had weighed upon me during the days of my youth. I am not ashamed to acknowledge to-day that I was carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment and that I sank down upon my knees and thanked Heaven out of the fullness of my heart for the favour of having been permitted to live in such a time. The fight for freedom had broken out on a scale unparalleled in the history of the world. From the moment that Fate took the helm in hand, the conviction grew among the masses of the people that now it was not a question of deciding the destinies of Austria or Serbia, but that the very existence of the German nation itself was at stake. For the last time, during many years of blindness, the people saw clearly into the future. Therefore, almost immediately after the gigantic struggle had begun, an excessive enthusiasm was replaced by a more earnest and more fitting undertone, because the exaltation of the popular spirit was not a mere passing frenzy.*

*People dreamed of the soldiers being home by Christmas and that then they would resume their daily work in peace. Whatever mankind desires, that it will hope for and believe in. The overwhelming majority of the people had long since grown weary of the perpetual insecurity in the general condition of public affairs. Hence, it was only natural that no one believed that the Austro-Serbian conflict could be shelved. Therefore, they looked forward to a radical settlement of accounts. I also belonged to the millions that desired this. The moment the, news of the Sarajevo outrage reached Munich two ideas came into my mind: First, that war was absolutely inevitable and, second, that the Habsburg State would now be forced to honour its signature to the Alliance, for what I had feared most was that one day Germany herself, perhaps as a result of the Alliance, would become involved in a conflict the direct cause of which was not Austria. In such a contingency, I feared that the Austrian State, for domestic political reasons, would find itself unable to decide in favour of its ally. The pro-Slav majority within the country would have immediately set to work to destroy any such intention and would rather have had the entire State go to rack and ruin than lend its ally the necessary assistance. But now this danger was removed. The old State was compelled to fight, whether it wished to do so or not.*  

- Page 177 (location ~ 2707-2717)    

*As a boy and as a young man, I often longed for the occasion to prove that my national enthusiasm was not mere vapouring. Hurrahing sometimes seemed to me to be a kind of sin, since I had not yet by my own actions earned the right to do so, for, after all, who has the right to shout that triumphant cry if he has not won that right where there is no play-acting and where the hand of the goddess of Destiny puts the truth and sincerity of nations and men to her inexorable test? Just as millions of others, I felt a proud joy in being permitted to go through this test. I had so often sung Deutschland uber Alles and so often roared ‘ Heil’ that, I now thought it a kind of retrospective grace that I was granted the right of appearing before the court of eternal justice to testify to the truth of those sentiments.*  

- Page 178 (location ~ 2723-2729)    

*At long last the day came when we left Munich on active service. For the first time in my life, I saw the Rhine, as we journeyed westwards to stand guard before that historic German river against its traditional and grasping enemy. As the first soft rays of the morning sun broke through the light mist and disclosed to us the Niederwald Statue, with one accord the whole troop-train broke into the strains of Die Wacht am Rhein. I then felt as if my heart would burst. Then followed a damp, cold night in Flanders. We marched in silence throughout the night and as the morning sun came through the mist an iron greeting suddenly burst above our heads. Shrapnel exploded in our midst and spluttered on the damp ground, but before the smoke of the explosion disappeared, a wild ‘Hurrah’ was shouted from two hundred throats in response to this, first greeting of Death. Then began the whistling of bullets and the booming of cannon, the whining and droning of shells; with eyes straining feverishly, we pressed forward; quicker and quicker, until we finally came to close-quarter fighting, beyond the beet-fields and the meadows. Soon the strains of a song reached us from afar. Nearer and nearer, from company to company, it came, and while Death began to make havoc in our ranks, we passed the song on to those beside us: Deutschland, Deutschland über Alles, über Alles in der Welt!*  

- Page 179 (location ~ 2745-2755)    

*A time came when there arose within each one of us a conflict between the urge to self-preservation and the call of duty, and I had to go through that conflict too. As Death sought its prey everywhere and unrelentingly, a nameless something rebelled within the weak body and tried to introduce itself under the name of common sense; but in reality it was fear, which had taken on this cloak in order to impose itself on the individual. Then there began an inner persuading and warning difficult to withstand, and it was often only the last flicker of conscience which carried the day. But the more the voice which advised prudence increased its efforts and the clearer and persuasive its appeal, the stronger did resistance become, until finally the internal strife was over and the call of duty was triumphant. As early as the winter of 1915–16, I had gone through that inner struggle.*  

- Page 180 (location ~ 2759-2766)    

*For a thousand years to come nobody will dare to speak of heroism without recalling the German Army of the World War, and then from the dim past will emerge the immortal vision of those solid ranks of steel helmets that never flinched and never faltered, and as long as Germans live they will be proud to remember that these men were sons of their forefathers.*  

- Page 181 (location ~ 2772-2775)    

*I was then a soldier and did not wish to meddle in politics, the more so because the time was inopportune. I still believe that the most humble stable-boy of those days served his country better than the best of, let us say, the ‘parliamentarians.’ My hatred for those chatterers was never greater than in those days when all decent men who had anything to say said it point-blank in the enemy’s face, or, failing this, kept their mouths shut and did their duty elsewhere. I despised those political fellows and if I had had my way I would have formed them into a Labour Battalion and given them the opportunity of babbling amongst themselves to their hearts’ content, without offence or harm to decent people. In those days I cared nothing for politics, but I could not help forming an opinion on certain phenomena which affected not only the whole nation, but also us soldiers in particular. There were two things which caused me the greatest anxiety at that time, and which I had come to regard as detrimental to our interests.*  

- Page 181 (location ~ 2775-2783)    

*Surely the time had come—so the press declared—for us Germans to remember that this war was not of our seeking and that hence there need be no feeling of shame in declaring our willingness to do our share towards effecting an understanding among the nations. For this reason it would not be wise to sully the radiant deeds of our Army with unbecoming jubilation, for the rest of the world would not understand this. Furthermore, nothing is more appreciated than the modesty with which a true hero quietly and unassumingly carries on and forgets. Such was the gist of their warning. Instead of catching these fellows by their long ears, dragging them to some ditch and looping a cord around their necks, so that the victorious enthusiasm of the nation should no longer offend their aesthetic sensibilities, a general press campaign was now allowed to go on against what was called ‘unbecoming’ and ‘undignified’ forms of victorious celebration. No one seemed to have the faintest idea that when public enthusiasm is once damped, nothing can kindle it again when the necessity arises. This enthusiasm is an intoxication and must be kept up in that form.*  

- Page 182 (location ~ 2788-2797)    

*Without the support of this enthusiastic spirit, how would it be possible to endure in a struggle which, according to human standards, made overwhelming demands, on the spiritual stamina of the nation? I was only too well acquainted with the psychology of the broad masses, not to know, that in such cases a magnanimous ‘aestheticism’ cannot fan the fire which is needed to keep the iron hot.. In my eyes it was even a mistake not to have tried to raise the pitch of public enthusiasm still higher. Therefore, I could not at all understand why the contrary policy was adopted, that is to say, the policy of damping the public spirit. Another thing which irritated me was the manner in which Marxism was regarded and accepted. I thought that all this proved how little they knew about the Marxist plague. It was believed in all seriousness that the abolition of party distinctions during the War had made Marxism a mild and-moderate thing. Here there was no question of party, but of a doctrine which was being expounded for the express purpose of leading humanity to its destruction. The purpose of this doctrine was not understood, because nothing was said about that side of the question in our Jew-ridden universities, and because our supercilious bureaucratic officials did not think it worth while to read upon a subject which had not been prescribed in their university course.*  

- Page 183 (location ~ 2797-2807)    

*In the August of 1914 every German worker was looked upon as a Marxist. That was a gross error. When that fateful day dawned, the German worker shook off the poisonous clutches of that plague; otherwise he would not have been so willing and ready to fight. Yet people were stupid enough to imagine that Marxism had now become ‘national’ another apt illustration of the fact that those in authority had never taken the trouble to study the real tenor of the Marxist teaching. If they had done so, such foolish errors would not have been committed. Marxism, whose final objective was, is, and will continue to be, the destruction of all non-Jewish national States, had to witness in those days of July 1914 how the German working-classes, which it had been ensnaring, were aroused by the national spirit and rapidly ranged themselves on the side of the Fatherland. Within a few days the deceptive smoke-screen of that infamous national betrayal had vanished into thin air and the Jewish bosses suddenly found themselves alone and deserted. It was as if not a vestige had been left of that folly and madness with which the masses of the German people had been inoculated for sixty years.*

*At one stroke, in the August of 1914, all the empty nonsense about international solidarity was knocked out of the heads of the German working classes. A few weeks later, instead of this stupid talk sounding in their ears, they heard the noise of American-manufactured shrapnel bursting above the heads of the marching columns, as a symbol of international comradeship. Now that the German worker had rediscovered the road back to his nation, it ought to have been the duty of any government, which had the welfare of the people at heart, to take this opportunity of mercilessly rooting out everything that was opposed to the national spirit. While the flower of the nation’s manhood was dying at the front, those at home could, at least, have exterminated this vermin. But, instead of doing so, His Majesty the Kaiser held out his hand to these hoary criminals, thus assuring them of his protection and allowing them to regain their mental composure.*

*The application of force alone, without moral support based on a spiritual concept, can never bring about the destruction of an ideal or arrest the propagation of it, unless one is ready and able ruthlessly to exterminate to a man the last upholders of that ideal, and also to wipe out any tradition which it may tend to leave behind. Now, in the majority of cases, the result of such a course has been to exclude such a State, either temporarily or forever, from the circle of States that are of political significance, but experience has also shown that such a sanguinary method of extirpation affects the better section of the population under the persecuting power. As a matter of fact, every persecution, which has no spiritual motives to support it, is morally unjust and raises opposition among the best elements of the population, so much so, that these*

As a matter of fact, every persecution, which has no spiritual motives to support it, is morally unjust and raises opposition among the best elements of the population, so much so, that these are driven more and more to champion the ideas that are unjustly persecuted. With many individuals this arises from the sheer spirit of opposition to every attempt at suppressing spiritual things by brute force.*  

- Page 186 (location ~ 2842-2850)    

*The fact remains that nearly all attempts to exterminate a doctrine, without having some spiritual basis of attack against it, and also to wipe out all the organisations it has created, have led in many cases to the very opposite being achieved, and that for the following reasons. When sheer force is used to combat the spread of a doctrine, then that force must be employed systematically and persistently. This means that the chances of success in the suppression of a doctrine lie only in the persistent and uniform application of the methods chosen. The moment hesitation is shown, and periods of tolerance alternate with the application of force, the doctrine against which these measures are directed will not only recover strength, but every successive persecution will bring to its support new adherents who have been shocked by the oppressive methods employed.*

*Summing up, we arrive at the conclusion that every attempt to combat a Weltanschauung by means of force will turn out futile in the end, if the struggle fails to take the form of an offensive for the establishment of an entirely new spiritual order of things. It is only in the struggle between two Weltanschauung en that physical force, consistently and ruthlessly applied, will eventually turn the scales in its own favour. It was in this that the fight against Marxism had hitherto failed. This was also the reason why Bismarck’s socialist legislation failed, and was bound to fail in the long run, despite everything. It lacked the basis of a new Weltanschauung for whose development and extension the struggle might have been taken up. To say that the serving up of drivel about a socalled ‘State authority’ or ‘law and order’ was an adequate foundation for the spiritual driving force in a life-and-death struggle, is only what one would expect to hear from the wiseacres in high official positions.*

*when the Iron Chancellor surrendered the fate of his struggle against Marxism to the goodwill of the bourgeois Democracy, he was leaving the goat to take care of the garden. But this was only the logical result of failure to find a fundamentally new Weltanschauung which was diametrically opposed to Marxism and inspired by an ardent determination to sweep all before it. Thus the result of the Bismarckian campaign was a bitter disappointment. Were conditions different during the World War, or at the beginning of it? Unfortunately, they were not. The more I then pondered over the necessity for a change in the attitude of the executive government towards Social Democracy, as the incorporation of contemporary Marxism, the more I realised the want of a practical substitute for this doctrine. Supposing Social Democracy were overthrown, what had one to offer the masses in its stead? Not a single movement existed which promised any success in attracting vast numbers of workers, who would be now more or less without leaders, and in holding these workers in its spell.*

*Generally speaking, one should guard against considering the broad masses more stupid than they really are. In political matters it frequently happens that feeling is a better judge than intellect. The opinion that the stupid international attitude of the masses provides proof of the unreliability of this feeling, can be immediately and definitely refuted by the simple fact that pacifist Democracy is no less fatuous, though it draws its supporters almost exclusively from bourgeois circles.*

In both cases the cook is one and the same—the Jew. One should be careful about contradicting established facts. It is an undeniable fact that the class question has nothing to do with questions concerning ideals, though that dope is administered at election time. Class arrogance among a large section of our people, as well as a prevailing tendency to look down on the manual labourer, are obvious facts and not the fancies of some day-dreamer.*

*In watching the course of political events I was always struck by the active part which propaganda played in them. I saw that it was an instrument which the Marxist Socialists knew how to handle in a masterly, way and to put to good practical use. Thus I soon came to realise that the right use of propaganda was an art in itself, and that this art was practically unknown to our bourgeois parties. The Christian Socialist Party alone, especially in Lueger’s time, showed a certain efficiency in the employment of this instrument and owed much of their success to it.*

*Despite all views to the contrary, this honour does actually exist, or rather it ought to exist, for a nation without honour will sooner or later lose its freedom and independence. This is in accordance with the ruling of a higher justice, for a generation of poltroons is not entitled to freedom. He who would be a cowardly slave cannot have honour; for such honour would soon become an object of general scorn. Germany was waging war for her very existence. The purpose of her war propaganda should have been to strengthen the fighting spirit in that struggle and help her to victory.*

He who would be a cowardly slave cannot have honour; for such honour would soon become an object of general scorn. Germany was waging war for her very existence. The purpose of her war propaganda should have been to strengthen the fighting spirit in that struggle and help her to victory. But when nations are fighting for their existence on this earth, when the question of ‘to be’ or ‘not to be’ has to be answered, then all humane and aesthetic considerations must be set aside, for these ideals do not exist of themselves somewhere in the air, they are the product of man’s creative imagination and will disappear when he disappears from the face of the earth. Nature knows nothing of them. Moreover, they are characteristic of only a small number of nations, or rather of races, and their value depends on the measure in which they spring from the racial feeling of the latter. Humane and aesthetic ideals will disappear from the inhabited earth when those races disappear which have been their creators and champions. All such ideals are only of secondary importance when a nation is struggling for its existence. They must be prevented from entering into the struggle the moment they threaten to weaken the stamina of the nation that is waging war. That is always the only visible effect whereby their place in the struggle is to be judged.*

*Schwabing decadents look upon Germany’s lot to-day as ‘aesthetic’? Of course, one does*  

- Page 193 (location ~ 2959-2959)    

*When people attempt to answer this reasoning by high-faluting talk about aesthetics, etc., only one answer can be given, namely, that the vital questions involved in the struggle of a nation for its existence must not be subordinated to any aesthetic considerations. The yoke of slavery is, and always will remain, the most unaesthetic experience that mankind can endure. Do the Schwabing decadents look upon Germany’s lot to-day as ‘aesthetic’? Of course, one does not discuss such a question with the Jews, because they are the modern inventors of this cultural perfume. Their very existence is an incarnate denial of the beauty of God’s image in His creation. Since these ideas of what is beautiful and humane have no place in warfare, they are not to be used as standards of war propaganda. During the war, propaganda was a means to an end, and this end was the German nation’s struggle for existence. Propaganda, therefore, should have been regarded from the standpoint of its utility for that purpose. The cruellest weapons were then the most humane, provided they helped towards a speedier decision; and only those methods were good and beautiful which helped towards securing the dignity and freedom of the nation.*  

- Page 193 (location ~ 2956-2965)    

*The second question of decisive importance is this: To whom should propaganda be made to appeal? To the educated intellectual classes? Or to the uneducated masses? Propaganda must always address itself to the broad masses of the people. Propaganda is not meant for the intellectual classes, or what we call the intellectual classes today, which demand scientific enlightenment. Propaganda has as little to do with science as an advertisement poster has to do with art, as far as concerns the form in which it presents its message. The art of the advertisement poster consists in the ability of the designer to attract the attention of the crowd through the form and colours he chooses. The advertisement poster announcing an exhibition of art has no other aim than to convince the public of the importance of the exhibition. The better it does that, the better the art of the poster as such.*  

- Page 194 (location ~ 2968-2975)    

*Therefore, those who wish to study art must study something that is quite different from the poster; indeed for that purpose they must do more than merely wander through the exhibition galleries. The student of art must carefully and thoroughly study each exhibition in order slowly to form a judicious opinion on it. The situation is the same in regard to what we understand by the word ‘propaganda.’ The purpose of propaganda is not the scientific instruction of the individual, but rather to attract public attention to certain facts, events, urgent needs, and so on, the importance of which can be brought home to the masses only by this means. Here the art of propaganda consists in putting a matter so clearly and forcibly before the minds of the people as to create a general conviction regarding the reality of a certain fact, the necessity of certain things and the imperativeness of something that is essential. As this art is not an end in itself and because its purpose must be exactly that of the advertisement poster, to attract the attention of the masses and not by any means to dispense individual instructions to those who already have an educated opinion on things, or who wish to form such an opinion on grounds of objective study (because that is not the purpose of propaganda), it must appeal to the feelings of the public rather than to their reasoning powers.*  

- Page 195 (location ~ 2976-2986)    

*The more modest the scientific level of this propaganda and the more it is addressed exclusively to public sentiment, the more decisive will be its success, which is the best test of the value of a piece of propaganda, and not the approbation of a small group of intellectuals or artistic people. The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to its feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form*

- Page 196 (location ~ 2991-2996)    

*The receptive powers of the masses are very restricted, and their power of understanding is slight. On the other hand, they quickly forget. Such being the case, all effective propaganda must be confined to a few bare essentials, and these must be expressed as far as possible in stereotyped formulas. These slogans should be persistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward. If this principle be forgotten, and if an attempt be made to be abstract and general, the propaganda will turn out ineffective, for the public will not be able to digest or retain what is offered to them in this way. Therefore, the greater the scope of the message that has to be presented, the more necessary is it for propaganda to choose that plan of action which is psychologically the most efficient.*  

- Page 196 (location ~ 2998-3004)    

*British and American war propaganda was psychologically efficient. By picturing the Germans to their own people as barbarians and Huns, they were preparing their soldiers for the horrors of war and safeguarding them against delusion. The most terrific weapons which those soldiers encountered in the field merely confirmed the information they had already received, and their belief in the truth of the assertions made by their respective governments was accordingly reinforced. Thus their rage and hatred against the infamous foe was increased. The terrible havoc caused by the German weapons of war was only another illustration of the Hunnish brutality of those barbarians, whereas, on the side of the Entente, no time was left for the soldiers to meditate on the similar havoc of which their own weapons were capable. Thus the British soldier was never allowed to feel that the information which he received at home was untrue. Unfortunately, the opposite was the case with the Germans, who finally wound up by rejecting everything from home as pure swindle and humbug.*  

- Page 197 (location ~ 3010-3018)    

*The worst thing of all was that our people did not understand the very first condition which has to be fulfilled in every kind of propaganda, namely, a systematically one sided attitude towards every problem that has to be dealt with. In this respect, so many errors were committed, even from the very beginning of the war, that it was justifiable to doubt whether so much folly could be attributed solely to the stupidity of people in higher quarters. What, for example, should we say of a poster which purported to advertise some new brand of soap by insisting on the excellent qualities of the competitive brands? We should naturally shake our heads, and the same is true of political advertisement. The aim of propaganda is not to try to pass judgment on conflicting rights, giving each its due, but exclusively to emphasise the right which we’re asserting. Propaganda must not investigate the truth objectively and, in so far as it is favourable to the other side, present it according to the theoretical rules of justice, but it must present only that aspect of the truth which is favourable to its own side.*  

- Page 198 (location ~ 3024-3032)    

*The masses are not in a position to discern where the enemy’s fault ends and where our own begins. In such a case, they become hesitant and distrustful, especially when the enemy does not make the same mistake, but heaps all the blame on his adversary. Could there be any clearer proof of this than the fact that finally our own people believed what was said by the enemy’s propaganda, which was uniform and consistent in its assertions, rather than in our own propaganda? This disbelief was, of course, increased by the mania for objectivity which afflicts our people. Everybody began to be careful about doing an injustice to the enemy, even at the cost of seriously injuring, and even ruining, his own people and State. Naturally, the masses were not conscious of the fact that those in authority had failed to study the subject from this angle. The great majority of a nation is so feminine in its character and outlook that its thought and conduct are ruled by sentiment rather than by sober reasoning. This sentiment, however, is not complex, but simple and consistent. It is not highly differentiated, but has only the negative and positive notions of love and hatred, right and wrong, truth and falsehood. Its notions are never partly this and partly that.*  

- Page 199 (location ~ 3039-3048)    

*No matter what the amount of talent employed in the organisation of propaganda, it will have no result if due account is not taken of one fundamental principle. Propaganda must be limited to a few simple themes and these must be presented again and again. Here, as in innumerable other cases, perseverance is the first and most important condition of success. Particularly in the field of propaganda, placid aesthetes and blasé intellectuals should never be allowed to take the lead. The former would readily transform the impressive character of real propaganda into something suitable only for literary tea-parties. As to the second class of persons, one must always beware of this pest; for, in consequence of their insensibility to normal impressions, they are constantly seeking fresh thrills. Such people grow sick and tired of everything. They always long for change and will always be incapable of putting themselves in the position of picturing the wants of their less callous fellow-creatures in their immediate neighbourhood, let alone trying to understand them.*  

- Page 200 (location ~ 3061-3069)    

*How their propaganda and their marvellous aptitude in the exercise of mass-influence reawakened the fighting spirit in that broken front and hammered into the heads of the soldiers a firm belief in final victory! Meanwhile, what were our people doing in this sphere? Nothing, or even worse than nothing. Again and again. I used to become enraged and indignant as I read the latest papers and realised the nature of the mass-murder they were committing through their influence on the minds of the people and the soldiers. More than once, I was tormented by the thought that, if Providence had put the conduct of German propaganda into my hands, instead of into the hands of those incompetent and even criminal ignoramuses and weaklings, the outcome of the struggle might have been different. During those months, I felt, for the first time that Fate was dealing adversely with me in keeping me on the fighting front and in a position where any chance bullet from some Negro’s rifle might finish me, whereas I could have done the Fatherland a real service in another sphere, for I was then presumptuous enough to believe that I would have been successful in managing the propaganda business. But I was unknown, one among eight millions. Hence, it was better for me to keep my mouth shut and do my duty as well as I could, in the position to which I had been assigned.*  

- Page 203 (location ~ 3107-3117)    

*These stupid letters written by German women eventually cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of our men. Thus in 1916 several distressing phenomena were already manifest. The whole front was complaining and ‘grousing,’ discontented over many things and often justifiably so. While they were hungry and yet patient, and their relatives at home were in distress, in other quarters there was feasting and revelry. Even at the front itself everything was not as it ought to have been in this respect. Even in the early stages of the War the soldiers were sometimes prone to complain, but such criticism was of a domestic nature. The man who at one moment groused and grumbled ceased his murmur after a few moments and went about his duty silently, as if this were a matter of course.*  

- Page 205 (location ~ 3141-3146)    

*The administrative offices were staffed by Jews. Almost every clerk was a Jew and every Jew was a clerk. I was amazed at this multitude of ‘warriors’, who belonged to the chosen race, and could not help comparing it with their slender numbers in the fighting lines. In the business world the situation was even worse. Here the Jews had actually become ‘indispensable.’ Like leeches, they were slowly sucking the blood from the pores of the national body. By means of newly-floated war-companies an instrument had been discovered whereby all national trade was throttled, so that no business could be carried on freely. Special emphasis was laid on the necessity for unhampered centralisation. Hence, as early as 1916–17, practically all production was under the control of Jewish finance. But against whom was the anger of the people directed? It was then, that I already saw the fateful day approaching which must finally bring the débâcle, unless timely preventive measures were taken. While Jewry was busy despoiling the nation and tightening the screws of its despotism, the work of inciting the people against the Prussians was intensified and just as nothing was done at the front to put a stop to this venomous propaganda, so here at home no official steps were taken against it. Nobody seemed capable of understanding that the collapse of Prussia could never bring about the rise of Bavaria. On the contrary, the collapse of the one must necessarily drag the other down with it. This kind of behaviour affected me very deeply. In it I could see only a clever Jewish trick for diverting public attention from themselves to others.*  

- Page 209 (location ~ 3193-3205)    

*Germany must not win the war. At that moment when victory seemed ready to alight on the German standards, a conspiracy was arranged for the purpose of striking at the heart of the Germany spring offensive with one blow from the rear and thus making victory impossible. A general strike was organised in the munitions factories. If this conspiracy had achieved its purpose, the German front would have collapsed and the wishes of the Vorwärts (the organ of the Social Democratic Party) that this time victory should not rest with the German banners, would have been fulfilled. For want of munitions, the front would have been broken through within a few weeks, the offensive would have been effectively stopped and the Entente saved. Then international finance would assume control over Germany and the internal objective of the Marxist betrayal of the nations would be achieved. That objective was the destruction of the national economic system and the establishment of international capitalistic domination in its stead. This goal has really been reached, thanks to the stupid credulity of the one side and the unspeakable cowardice of the other. The munitions strike, however, did not bring the final success that had been hoped for, namely, to starve the front of ammunition. It lasted too short a time for the lack of ammunition as such to bring disaster to the Army, as was originally planned, but the moral damage was much more terrible.*  

- Page 210 (location ~ 3219-3229)    

*The policy of restricting the offensive to the East, which had been imposed on the German military authorities by the necessities of the situation, now seemed to the Entente a tactical stroke of genius. For three years these Germans had been battering away at the Russian front without any apparent success at first. Those fruitless efforts were almost sneered at, for it was thought that in the long run the Russian giant would triumph through sheer force of numbers. Germany would be worn out through shedding so much blood, and facts appeared to confirm this hope. Since the days of September 1914, when, for the first time, interminable columns of Russian prisoners of war had poured into German, after the Battle of Tannenberg, it seemed as if the stream would never end, but that as soon as one army was defeated and routed, another took its place. The supply of soldiers which the gigantic empire placed at the disposal of the Czar seemed inexhaustible; new victims were always at hand for the holocaust of war. How long could Germany hold out in this competition?*  

- Page 212 (location ~ 3243-3250)    

*From the very beginning, I had my own definite personal views. I intensely loathed the whole gang of miserable party politicians who had betrayed the people. I had long ago realised that the interests of the nation played only a very small part with this disreputable crew and that what counted with them was the possibility of filling their own empty pockets. My opinion was that those people thoroughly deserved to be hanged, because they were ready to sacrifice the peace and, if necessary, allow Germany to be defeated just to serve their own ends. To consider their wishes would mean to sacrifice the interests of the working-classes for the benefit of a gang of thieves. To meet their wishes meant to agree to sacrifice Germany. Such, too, was the opinion still held by the majority of the Army, but the reinforcements which came from home were fast becoming worse and worse —so much so that their arrival was a source of weakness rather than of strength to our fighting forces. The young recruits, in particular, were for the most part useless. Sometimes it was hard to believe that they were sons of the same nation that sent its youth into the battles that were fought round Ypres. In August and September the symptoms of moral disintegration increased more and more rapidly, although the enemy’s offensive was not at all comparable to the frightfulness, of our own former defensive battles. In comparison with this offensive, the battles fought on the Somme and in Flanders remained in our memories as the most terrible of all horrors.*

*In November, the general tension increased. Then one day disaster broke in upon us suddenly and without warning. Sailors came in motor-lorries and called on us to rise in revolt. A few Jews were the ‘leaders’ in that combat for the ‘Liberty, Beauty, and Dignity’ of our national existence. Not one of them had seen active service at the front. By way of a hospital for venereal diseases these three Orientals had been seat back home. Now they were hoisting their red rags here. During the last few days I had begun to feel somewhat better. The burning pain in my eye-sockets had become less severe. Gradually, I was able to distinguish the general outlines of my immediate surroundings, and it was permissible to hope that I would at least recover my sight sufficiently to be able to take up some profession later on. That*

*On November 10th, the local pastor visited the hospital for the purpose of delivering a short address, and that was how we came to know the whole story. I was in a fever of excitement as I listened to the address. The reverend old gentleman seemed to be trembling when he informed us that the House of Hohenzollern should no longer wear the Imperial Crown, that the Fatherland had become a ‘Republic,’ that we should pray to the Almighty not to withhold His blessing from the new order of things and not to abandon our people in the days to come. In delivering this, message he could not do more than briefly express appreciation of the Royal House, its services to Pomerania, to Prussia, indeed to the whole of the German Fatherland, and at this point he broke down. A feeling of profound dismay fell on the people in that assembly, and I do not think there was a single eye that was not wet with tears. As for myself, I broke down completely when the old gentleman tried to resume his story by informing us that we must now end this long war, because the war was lost, he said, and we were at the mercy of the victor. The Fatherland would have to bear heavy burdens in the future. We were to accept the terms of the Armistice and trust to the magnanimity of our former enemies. It was impossible for me to stay and listen any longer. Darkness surrounded me as I staggered and stumbled back to my ward and buried my aching head between the blankets and pillow. I had not cried since the day that I stood beside my mother’s grave. Whenever Fate dealt cruelly with me in my young days the spirit of determination within me grew stronger and stronger. During all those long years of war, when Death claimed many a true friend and comrade from our ranks, to me it would have appeared sinful to have uttered a word of complaint. Did they not die for Germany? And, finally, almost in the last few days of that titanic struggle, when the waves of poison-gas enveloped me and began to penetrate my eyes, the thought of becoming permanently blind unnerved me, but the voice of conscience cried out immediately—‘You miserable fellow, would you start howling when there are thousands of others whose lot is a hundred times worse than yours?’*

*Emperor Wilhelm II was the first German Emperor to offer the hand of friendship to the Marxist leaders, not suspecting that they were scoundrels without any sense of honour. While they held the imperial hand in one of theirs, the other was already feeling for the dagger. There is no such thing as coming to an understanding with the Jews. It must be a hard-and-fast ‘Either-Or.’ For my part I then decided that I would take up political work.*

*A few days after the liberation of Munich I was ordered to appear before the Inquiry Commission which had been set up by the 2nd Infantry Regiment for the purpose of investigating revolutionary activities. That was my first incursion into the more or less political field. A few weeks later I received orders to attend a course of lectures which were being given to members of the Army. This course was meant to propagate certain fundamental principles on which the soldier could base his political ideas. For me the advantage of this organisation was that it gave me a chance of meeting fellow-soldiers who were of the same way of thinking and with whom I could discuss the actual situation. We were all more or less firmly convinced that Germany could not be saved from imminent disaster by those who had participated in the November crime—that is to say, by the Centre and the Social Democrats, and also that the socalled Bourgeois-National group could not make*

*In our small circle we discussed the project of forming a new party. The leading ideas which we then proposed were the same as those which were carried into effect afterwards, when the German Labour Party was founded. The name of the new movement which was to be founded should be such that, of itself, it would appeal to the masses of the people, for all our efforts would turn out vain and useless if this condition were lacking. That was the reason why we chose the name ‘Social Revolutionary Party,’ particularly because the social principles of our new organisation were indeed revolutionary. There was also a more fundamental reason. The attention which I had given to economic problems during my earlier years was more or less confined to considerations arising directly out of the social problem. Subsequently my outlook broadened as I came to study the German policy of alliance. This policy was very largely the result of an erroneous valuation of the economic situation, together with a confused notion as to the basis on which the future subsistence of the German people could be guaranteed. All these ideas were based on the principle that capital is exclusively the product of labour and that, just like labour, it was subject to all the factors which can hinder or promote human activity. Hence, from the national standpoint, the significance of capital depended on the greatness, freedom and power of the State, that is to say, of the nation, and it is this dependence alone which leads capital to promote the interests of the State and the nation, from an instinct of self-preservation and for the sake of its own development.*

*The greatness of the one will depend on the absolute truth of his idea considered in the abstract; whereas that of the other will depend on whether or not he correctly judges the given realities and how they may be utilised under the guidance of the truths established by the former. The test of greatness as applied to a political leader is the success of his plans and his enterprises, which means his ability to reach the goal for which he sets out; whereas the final goal set up by the political philosopher can never be reached, for human thought may grasp truths and visualise ends which it sees with crystal clarity, though such ends can ever be completely attained, because human nature is weak and imperfect. The more an idea is correct in the abstract, and, the more comprehensive it therefore is, the smaller is the possibility of putting it into practice, at least as far as this depends on human beings. The significance of a political philosopher does not depend on the practical success of the plans he lays down, but rather on their absolute truth and the influence they exert on the progress of mankind.*

*Within long spans of human progress it may occasionally happen that the practical politician and political philosopher are one. The more intimate this union is, the greater will be the obstacles which the activity of the politician will have to encounter. Such a man does not labour for the purpose of satisfying demands that are obvious to every Philistine, but he reaches out towards ends which can be understood only by the few. His life is torn asunder by hatred and love. The protest of his contemporaries, who do not understand the man, is in conflict with the recognition of posterity, for whom he also works. The greater the work which a man does for the future, the less will he be appreciated by his contemporaries. His struggle will accordingly be the more severe, and his success the rarer. When, in the course of centuries, such a man appears and is blessed with success, then, towards the end of his days, he may have a faint prevision of his future fame. Such great men are only the Marathon runners of history; the laurels of contemporary fame are only for the brow of the dying hero. The great protagonists are those who fight for their ideas and ideals despite the fact that they receive no recognition at the hands of their contemporaries. They are the men whose memories will be enshrined in the hearts of future generations.*

*The absolute separation of stock-exchange capital from the economic life of the nation would make it possible to oppose the process of internationalisation in German business, without at the same time attacking capital as such, for to do this would jeopardise the foundations of our national independence. I clearly saw what was developing in Germany and I realised then that the stiffest fight we would have to wage would not be against an alien enemy, but against international capital. In Feder’s speech I found an effective slogan for our coming struggle. Here again, later events proved how correct was the impression we then had. The fools among our bourgeois politicians no longer mock at us on this score, for even those politicians now see if they would speak the truth that international stock-exchange capital was not only the chief instigating factor in bringing about the war, but that, now the war is over, it serves to turn the peace into a hell.*

The struggle against international finance capital and loan capital has become one of the most important points in the programme on which the German nation has based its fight for economic freedom and independence.*

*In the second place, the following must be borne in mind. Any idea may be a source of danger if it is looked upon as an end in itself, when in reality it is only the means to an end. For me, and for all genuine National Socialists, there is only one slogan: People and Fatherland. What we have to fight for is the necessary security for the existence and increase of our race and people, the subsistence of our children and the maintenance of our racial stock unmixed, the freedom and independence of the Fatherland, so that our people may be enabled to fulfil the mission assigned to it by the Creator. All ideas and ideals, all teaching and all knowledge, must serve these ends. It is from this standpoint that everything must be examined and turned to practical use, or else discarded. Thus, a theory can never become a mere dead dogma, since everything must serve the purpose of guaranteeing our existence.*

*In another direction also, this course of lectures had important consequences for me. One day I put my name down as wishing to take part in the discussion. Another of the participants thought that he would break a lance for the Jews and entered into a lengthy defence of them. This aroused my opposition. An overwhelming number of those who attended the lecture course supported my views. The consequence of it all was that, a few days later, I was assigned to a regiment then stationed in Munich and given a position there as ‘instruction officer.’ At that time the spirit of discipline was rather weak among the troops which were still suffering from the after-effects of the period when the Soldiers’ Councils were in control. Only gradually and carefully could a new spirit of military discipline and obedience be introduced in place of ‘voluntary obedience,’ a term which had been used to express the ideal of military discipline under Kurt Eisner’s higgledy-piggledy regime. The soldiers had to be taught to think and feel in a national and patriotic way. In these two directions lay my future line of action. I took up my work with the greatest zeal and devotion. Here I was presented with an opportunity of speaking before quite a large audience. I was now able to confirm what I had hitherto merely felt, namely, that I had a talent for public speaking. My voice had become so much better that I could be well understood, at least in all parts of the small hall where the soldiers assembled. No task could have been more pleasing to me than this one; for now, before being demobilised, I was in a position to render useful service to an institution which had become infinitely dear to my heart, namely, the Army.*

*Since I usually woke up about five o’clock every morning, I got into the habit of amusing myself with watching little mice which scampered about my small room. I used to place a few pieces of hard bread or crust on the floor and watch the funny little creatures playing around and enjoying themselves with these delicacies. I had suffered so many privations in my life that I well knew what hunger was and could only too well picture to myself the pleasure these little creatures were experiencing. On the morning after the meeting I have mentioned, it happened that about five o’clock I lay fully awake in bed, watching the mice playing and vying with each other. As I was not able to go to sleep again, I suddenly remembered the pamphlet that one of the workers had given me at the meeting. It was a small pamphlet of which this worker was the author. In his little book he described how his mind had thrown off the shackles of the Marxist and tradeunion phraseology, and how he had come back to the nationalist ideals. That was the reason why he had entitled his little book, My Political Awakening. The pamphlet secured my attention the moment I began to read, and I read it with interest to the end. The process here described was similar to that which I had experienced in my own case twelve years previously. Unconsciously, my own experiences began to stir again in my mind. During that day my thoughts returned several times to what I had read, but I finally decided to give the matter no further attention. A week or so later, however, I received a postcard which informed me, to my astonishment, that I had been admitted to the German Labour Party. I was asked to answer this communication and to intend a meeting of the party committee on Wednesday next.*  

- Page 235 (location ~ 3602-3616)    

*I am not one of those people who will begin something to-day just to give it up the next day for the sake of something new. That was the main reason which made it so difficult for me to decide to join something newly founded; for this must become the real fulfilment of everything I dreamt, or else it had better not be started at all. I knew that such a decision would bind me for ever and then there could be no turning back. For me there could be no idle dallying, but only a cause to be championed ardently. I had already an instinctive feeling against people who took up everything, but never carried anything through to the end. I loathed these Jacks-of-all trades, and considered the activities of such people to be worse than if they were to remain entirely quiescent. Fate herself now seemed to point a finger that showed me the way. I should never have entered one of the big parties already in existence and shall explain my reasons for this later on. This ludicrous little formation, with its handful of members, seemed to have the unique advantage of not yet being fossilised into an ‘organisation’ and still offered a chance for real personal activity on the part of the individual. Here it might still be possible to do some effective work, and, as the movement was still small, one could all the more easily give it the required shape. Here it was still possible to determine the character of the movement, the aims to be achieved and the road to be taken, which would have been impossible in the case of any of the big parties already existing. The longer I reflected on the problem, the more my conviction grew, that just such a small movement would best serve as an instrument to prepare the way for the national resurgence, but that this could never be done by the political parliamentary parties which were too firmly attached to obsolete ideas or had an interest in supporting the new regime.*  

- Page 239 (location ~ 3655-3669)    

*Another difficulty arose from the fact that I had not gone through the regular school curriculum. The socalled ‘intellectuals’ still look down with infinite superciliousness on anyone who has not been through the prescribed schools and allowed them to pump the necessary knowledge into him. The question, What can a man do? is never asked, but rather, what has he learned? ‘Educated’ people look upon any imbecile who is plastered with a number of academic certificates as being superior to the ablest young fellow who lacks these precious documents. I could therefore easily imagine how this ‘educated’ world would receive me and I was wrong only in so far as I then believed men to be for the most part better than they proved to be in the cold light of reality.*

*That kind of impudence which is typical of the Jews was necessary in order to proclaim the defeat of the Army as the cause of the German collapse, indeed the Berlin Vorwä rts, that organ and mouthpiece of sedition, wrote on this occasion that the German nation should not be permitted to bring home its banners in triumph. Yet our collapse is attributed to the military defeat. Of course it would be out of the question to enter into an argument with these liars who deny one moment what they said the moment before. I should waste no further words on them were it not for the fact that there are many thoughtless people who repeat all this parrot-fashion, without being necessarily inspired by any evil motives. But the observations I am making here are also meant for our fighting followers, seeing that nowadays*

- Page 245 (location ~ 3743-3749)    

*The assertion that the loss of the war was the cause of the German collapse can best be answered as follows: It is admittedly a fact that the loss of the war was of tragic importance for the future of our country, but that loss was not in itself a cause. It was rather the consequence of other causes. That a disastrous ending to this life and death conflict must have involved catastrophes in its train was clearly seen by everyone of insight who could think in a straightforward manner, but unfortunately there were also people whose powers of understanding seemed to fail them at that critical moment. There were other people who had first questioned that truth and then altogether denied it, and there were people who, after their secret desire had been fulfilled, were suddenly faced with the state of affairs, that resulted from their own collaboration.*  

- Page 245 (location ~ 3750-3756)    

*That organisation and leadership of the German Army was the most mighty thing that the world has ever seen. Any shortcomings which became evident were humanly unavoidable. The collapse of that Army was not the cause of our present distress. It was itself the consequence of ether faults, but this consequence in its turn ushered in a further collapse, which was more obvious. That such was actually the case can be shown as follows: Must a military defeat necessarily lead to such a complete overthrow of the State and the nation? Whenever has this been the result of an unfortunate, lost war? Are nations in fact ever ruined by a lost war and by that alone? The answer to this question can be briefly stated by referring to the fact that military defeats are the result of internal decay, cowardice, want of character, and are a retribution for such things. If such were not the case, then a military defeat would lead to a national resurgence and bring the nation to a higher pitch of effort. A military defeat is not the tombstone of national life. History affords innumerable examples to confirm the truth of that statement.*  

- Page 246 (location ~ 3762-3771)    

*It remained for the Jews, with their unqualified capacity for falsehood, and their fighting comrades, the Marxists, to impute responsibility for the downfall precisely to the man who alone had shown superhuman will-power and energy in his, effort to prevent the catastrophe which he had foreseen and to save the nation from that hour of complete overthrow and shame. By placing responsibility for the loss of the World War on the shoulders of Ludendorff, they took away the weapon of moral right from the only adversary dangerous enough to be likely to succeed in bringing the betrayers of the Fatherland to justice.*  

- Page 248 (location ~ 3799-3803)    

*All this was inspired by the principle which is quite true in itself—that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corruptible in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily had, and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they are readily fall victims to the big lie than to the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters, but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehood. It would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so are put clearly before them, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think that there may be some other explanation, for the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down—a fact which all expert liars in this world and all who conspire together in the art of lying know only too well and exploit in the basest manner. From time immemorial, however, the Jews have known better than any others how falsehood and calumny can be exploited. Is not their very existence founded on one great lie, namely, that they are a religious community, whereas in reality they are a race? And what a race! One of the greatest thinkers that mankind has produced has branded the Jews for all time with a statement which is profoundly and exactly true. He called the Jew “the great master of lies.” Those who do not realise the truth of that statement, or do not wish to believe it, will never be able to lend a hand in helping truth to prevail. We may regard it as a great stroke of fortune for the German nation that its period of lingering suffering was so suddenly curtailed and transformed into such a terrible catastrophe, for if things had gone on as they were, the nation would, more slowly but more surely, have been ruined. The disease would have become chronic; whereas, in the acute form of the disaster, it at least showed itself clearly to the eyes of a considerable number of observers.*

*Financial operations succeed more easily than war operations. Hence it was no longer any great attraction for a true hero or even a statesman to be brought into touch with some Jewish banker. Real merit was not interested in receiving cheap decorations and therefore declined them with thanks. But from the standpoint of good breeding such a development was deeply regrettable. The aristocracy began to lose more and more those racial qualities that were a condition of its very existence, with the result that, in many cases, the term ‘plebeian’ would have been more appropriate. A serious state of economic disruption was being brought about by the slow elimination of the personal control of vested interests and the gradual transference of the whole economic structure into the hands of joint-stock companies. In this way labour became degraded into an object of speculation in the hands of unscrupulous exploiters. The de-personalisation of property ownership increased on a vast scale. Financial exchange circles began to triumph and made slow but sure progress in assuming control of the whole of national life. Before the war, the internationalisation of the German economic structure had already begun by the roundabout way of share issues. It is true that a section of the German industrialists made determined attempts to avert the danger, but in the end they gave way before the united attacks of money-grabbing capitalism, which was assisted in this fight by its faithful henchman, the Marxist movement.*  

- Page 252 (location ~ 3859-3870)    

*As I write these words, success is attending the general attack on the German State Railways which are now to be turned over to international capitalists. Thus ‘International Social Democracy’ has once again attained one of its main objectives. The best evidence of how far this ‘commercialisation’ of the German nation was able to progress, can be seen plainly in the fact that when the war was over, one of the leading captains of German industry and commerce gave it as his opinion that commerce as such was the only force which could put Germany on her feet again. This sort of nonsense was uttered just at the time when France was re-establishing public education on a humanitarian basis, thus doing away with the idea that national life was dependent on commerce rather than on ideal values.*

*German education in pre-war times had an extraordinary number of weak features. It was simply and exclusively limited to the production of pure knowledge and paid little attention to the development of practical ability. Still less attention was given to the development of individual character, in so far as this is ever possible, and hardly any attention at all was paid to the development of a sense of responsibility, to strengthening the will and the power of decision. The result of this method was not to turn out stalwart men, but rather docile creatures crammed with knowledge and to produce erudite people who had a passion for knowing everything. Before the war, we Germans were accepted and estimated accordingly. The German was liked because good use could be made of him; but there was little esteem for him personally, on account of his weakness of character. For those who can read its significance aright, there is much instruction in the fact that among all nationalities Germans were the first to part with their national citizenship when they found themselves in a foreign country, and there is a world of meaning in the saying that was then prevalent, that in hand one can go through the whole country.*

This kind of social etiquette turned out disastrous when it prescribed the exclusive forms that had to be observed in the presence of His Majesty. These forms insisted that there should be no contract fiction whatsoever, but that everything should be praised which His Majesty condescended to like.*

*A man who is serious about the maintenance and welfare of an institution will cling to it with might and main and will not be able to .get over it, should that institution show certain faults and failings, and he will certainly not run around telling the world about it, as certain false democratic ‘friends’ of the monarchy have done; but he will approach His Majesty, the wearer of the crown himself, to warn him of the seriousness of the situation and persuade the monarch to act.*

Furthermore, he will not take up the standpoint that it must be left to His Majesty to act as the latter thinks fit, even though the course which he would take must plainly lead to disaster. The man I am thinking of will deem it his duty to protect the monarchy against the monarch himself, no matter what personal risk he may run in so doing. If the worth of the monarchical institution were dependent on the, person of the monarch himself, then it would be the worst institution imaginable; for only in rare cases are kings found to be models of wisdom, understanding and integrity of character, though we might like to think otherwise. This fact is unpalatable to the professional knaves and lackeys, but all upright men, and they are the backbone of the nation, repudiate the nonsensical fiction that all monarchs are wise, etc. For such men history is history and truth is truth, even where monarchs are concerned. It is so seldom that a nation has the good luck to possess a great king who is at the same time a great man, that it ought to consider itself fortunate if malignant Fate has not reserved for it a still more terrible lot. It is clear that the worth and significance of the monarchical principle cannot rest in the person of the monarch alone, unless Heaven decrees that the crown should be set on the head of a brilliant hero like Frederick the Great, or a sagacious man like Wilhelm I.*

*Generally speaking, readers of the press can be classified in three groups: First, those who believe everything they read; second, those who no longer believe anything; third, those who critically examine what they read and form their judgments accordingly. Numerically, the first group is by far the largest, being composed of the broad masses of the people. Intellectually, it forms the simplest portion of the nation. It cannot be classified according to occupation, but only into grades of intelligence. Under this category come all those who have not been born to think for themselves or who have not learnt to do so and who, partly through incompetence end partly through ignorance, believe everything that is set before them in print. To these we must add that type of lazy individual who, although capable of thinking for himself, out of sheer laziness gratefully absorbs everything that otters have thought out, modestly believing this to have been thoroughly done. The influence which the press has on all these people who constitute the broad masses of a nation, is therefore enormous.*  

- Page 258 (location ~ 3951-3959)    

*The second group is numerically smaller, being partly composed of those who were formerly in the first group and after a series of bitter disappointments are now prepared to believe nothing of what they see in print. They hate all newspapers. Either they do not read them at all or they become exceptionally annoyed at their contents, which they hold to be nothing but a conglomery of lies and mis-statements. These people are difficult to handle, for they will always be sceptical of the truth. Consequently, they are useless for any form of positive work. The third group is easily the smallest, being composed of real intellectuals whom natural aptitude and education have taught to think for themselves and who in all things try to form their own judgments, while at the same time carefully sifting what they read. They will not read any newspaper without using their own intelligence to collaborate with that of the writer, and naturally this does not set writers an easy task. Journalists appreciate this type of reader only with a certain amount of reservation.*  

- Page 259 (location ~ 3962-3970)    

*Nowadays, when the voting papers of the masses are the deciding factor, the decision lies in the hands of the numerically strongest group; that is to say the first group, the crowd of simpletons and the credulous. It is an all-important interest of the State and a national duty to prevent these people from falling into the hands of false, ignorant or even evil-minded teachers. Therefore it is the duty of the State to supervise their education and prevent every form of offence in this respect. Particular attention should be paid to the press; for its influence on these people is by far the strongest and most penetrating of all, since its effect is not transitory but continual. Its immense significance lies in the uniform and persistent repetition of its teaching.*  

- Page 260 (location ~ 3974-3980)    

*Here, if anywhere, the State should never forget that all means should converge towards the same end. It must not be led astray by the will-o’-the- wisp of socalled ‘freedom of the press,’ or be talked into neglecting its duty, and withholding from the nation that which is good and which does good. With ruthless determination the State must keep control of this instrument of popular education and place it at the service of the State and the nation.*

*Did not the press oppose with all its might every move to give the State that which belongs to the State, and be means of constant criticism injure the reputation of the Army, sabotage general conscription and demand refusal of military credits, etc.—until the success of this campaign was assured? The function of the socalled liberal press was to dig the grave for the German people and Reich. No mention need be made of the lying Marxist press. To it the spreading of falsehood is as much a vital necessity as hunting is to a cat. Its sole task is to break the national backbone of the people, thus preparing the nation to become the slaves of international finance and its masters, the Jews. What measures did the State take to counteract this wholesale poisoning of the public mind? Absolutely none. The passing of a few paltry decrees, punishment meted out in a few cases of flagrant infamy, and there the matter ended. By this policy it was hoped to win the favour of this pest by means of flattery, by a recognition of the ‘value’ of the press, is ‘importance,’ its ‘educative mission’ and similar nonsense. The Jews acknowledged all this with a knowing smile and returned thanks. The reason for this ignominious failure on the part of the State lay not so much in its refusal to realise the danger as in the out-and-out cowardly way of meeting the situation by the adoption of faulty and ineffective measures. No one had the courage to employ any energetic and radical methods.*

*The defence put up by the government in those days against a mainly Jew-controlled press that was slowly corrupting the nation, followed no definite line of action, it had no determination ‘behind it and above all, no fixed objective’ whatsoever in view. This is where official understanding of the situation completely failed, not only in estimating the importance of the struggle, but in choosing the means and deciding on a definite plan. They merely tinkered with the problem. Occasionally when bitten, they imprisoned one or another journalistic viper for a few weeks or months, but the whole poisonous brood was allowed to carry on in peace. It must be admitted that all this was partly the result of extraordinarily crafty tactics on the part of Jewry on the one hand, and obvious, official stupidity or naivety, on the other. The Jews were too clever to allow a simultaneous attack to be made on the whole of their press. One section functioned as cover for the other. While the Marxist newspaper, in the most despicable manner possible, reviled everything that was sacred, furiously attacked the State and government and incited certain classes of the community against each other, bourgeois-democratic papers, also in Jewish hands, succeeded in camouflaging themselves as model examples of objectivity. They studiously avoided harsh language, knowing well that blockheads are capable of judging only by external appearances and are never able to penetrate to the real depth and meaning of anything. They measure the worth of an object by its exterior and not by its contents. This form of human frailty was carefully studied and understood by the press.*

*By this class of blockheads, the Frankfurter Zeitung would be acknowledged as the essence of respectability. It always carefully avoided calling a spade a spade. It deprecated the use of every form of physical force and persistently appealed to the nobility of fighting with ‘intellectual’ weapons. This method of fighting was, curiously enough, most popular with the least intellectual classes. That is one of the results of our defective education, which deprives young people of their natural instincts, pumps into them a certain amount of knowledge without, however, being able to give them real insight, since this requires not only diligence and goodwill, but innate understanding. This final insight at which man must aim is the understanding of causes which an instinctive and fundamental. Let me explain: Man must not fall into the error of thinking that he was ever meant to become lord and master of Nature. A lopsided education has helped to encourage that illusion. Man must realise that a fundamental law of necessity reigns throughout the whole realm of Nature and that his existence is subject to the law of eternal struggle and strife.*

He will then feel that there cannot be a separate law for mankind in a universe in which planets and suns follow their orbits, where moons and planets trace their destined paths, where the strong are always the masters of the weak and where the latter must obey or be destroyed. Man must also submit to the eternal principles of this supreme wisdom. He may try to understand them but he can never free himself from their sway. It is just for our intellectual demi-monde that the Jew writes those papers which he calls his ‘intellectual’ press. For them the Frankfurter Zeitung and Berliner Tageblatt are written, the tone being adapted to them, and it is over these people that such papers have an influence.*

*ready to believe them since the others indulge only in moderate ravings which never*  

- Page 264 (location ~ 4037-4037)    

*The effervescent tone and the fine phraseology lull the reader into believing that a love for knowledge and more it principle is the sole driving force that determines the policy of such papers, whereas in reality these features represent a sunning way of disarming any opposition that might be directed against the press. Some make a parade of respectability and the imbecile public is all the more ready to believe them since the others indulge only in moderate ravings which never amount to abuse of the ‘freedom of the press’ (as this system of feeding the public on lies and poisoning the public mind is called). Hence, the authorities are very slow indeed to take any steps against these journalistic bandits for fear of immediately alienating the sympathy of the socalled respectable press fear that is only too well founded, for the moment any attempt is made to proceed against any member of the gutter press all the others rush to its assistance at once, not indeed to support its policy, but simply and solely to defend the principles of freedom of the press and liberty of public opinion. This outcry will succeed in intimidating the most stalwart, for it comes from the mouth of what is called decent journalism. In this way the, poison was allowed to enter the national bloodstream and infect public life, without the government taking any effectual measures to master the course of the disease. The ridiculous half-measures that were taken were in themselves an indication of the process of disintegration that was already threatening to break up the Reich, for an institution practically surrenders its existence when it is no Longer determined to defend itself with all the weapons at its command. Every half-measure is the outward expression of an internal process of decay which must lead to an external collapse sooner or later. I believe that our present generation would easily master this danger, if it were led aright, for it has gone through certain experiences which must have strengthened the nerves of all those who were not broken by them.*

*Certainly in days to come the Jews will raise a tremendous cry in their newspapers once a hand is laid on their favourite nest, once a move is made to put an end to this scandalous press and once this instrument which moulds public opinion is brought under State control and no longer left in the hands of aliens and enemies of the people. I am certain that this will be easier for us than it was for our fathers. The scream of the twelve-inch shell is more penetrating than the hiss of a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers. Therefore, let them go on with their hissing. A further example of the weak and hesitating way in which vital national problems were dealt with in pre-war Germany is the following. Hand-in-hand with the political and moral process of infecting the nation, an equally virulent process of infection had for many years been attacking the health of the nation. In large cities particularly, syphilis steadily increased and tuberculosis kept pace with it in reaping its harvest of death in almost every part of the country. Although in both cases the effect on the nation was alarming, it seemed as if nobody were in a position to undertake any decisive measures against these scourges. In the case of syphilis especially, the attitude of the State and the public authorities was one of absolute capitulation. To combat this state of affairs measures more sweeping than those actually adopted should have been enforced.*  

- Page 265 (location ~ 4050-4060)    

*The discovery of a remedy which was of a questionable nature and the excellent way in which it was placed on the market were of little assistance ill fighting such a scourge. Here again the only course to adopt is to attack the causes rather than the symptoms of the disease, but in this case, the primary cause is to be found in the manner in which love has been prostituted. Even though this did not directly bring about the fearful disease itself, the nation must still suffer serious damage thereby, for the moral havoc resulting from this prostitution would be sufficient to bring about the destruction of, the nation, slowly but surely. This Judaising of our spiritual life and mammonising of our natural instinct for procreation will sooner or later work havoc with our whole posterity. Instead of strong, healthy children, the product of natural feelings, we shall see miserable specimens of humanity resulting from economic calculation, for economic considerations are becoming more and more the foundation and the sole preliminary condition of marriage while love looks for an outlet elsewhere. Here as elsewhere, one may defy Nature for a certain period of time, but sooner or later she will take her inevitable revenge, and when man realises this truth, it is often too late. Our own nobility furnishes an example of the devastating consequences that result from a persistent refusal to recognise the primary conditions necessary for normal wedlock.*  

- Page 265 (location ~ 4060-4071)    

*Here we are face to face with the results of procreation which is, on the one hand, determined by social pressure and, on the other, by financial considerations. The one leads to inherited debility, and the other to adulteration of the blood-strain; for all the Jewish daughters of the department store proprietors are looked upon as eligible mates to co-operate in propagating his lordship’s stock, and the stock certainly looks it. All this leads to absolute degeneration. Nowadays our bourgeoisie is making efforts to follow in the same path. Theirs will be a similar fate. These unpleasant truths are hastily and nonchalantly brushed aside, as if by so doing the real state of affairs could also be abolished, but it cannot be denied that the population of our great towns and cities is tending more and more to avail itself of prostitution in the exercise of its amorous instincts and is thus becoming more and more contaminated by the scourge of venereal disease. On the one hand, the visible effects of this mass-infection can be observed in our lunatic asylums and, on the other hand, alas! among the children. These are the doleful and tragic products of the steadily increasing scourge that is poisoning our sexual life. Their sufferings are the visible results of parental vice.*

*Finally, there are those who are well aware of the terrible results which this scourge will inevitably bring about, but they merely shrug their shoulders, fully convinced of their inability to undertake anything against this peril. Hence, matters are allowed to take their course. Undoubtedly all this is very convenient and simple, only the fact must not be overlooked that this convenient way of approaching things can leave fatal consequences for our national life. The excuse that other nations are not faring any better does not alter the fact of our own deterioration, except that the feeling of sympathy for other stricken nations makes our own suffering easier to bear. But the important question that arises here is, Which nations will be the first to take the initiative in mastering this scourge, and which nations will succumb to it? This will be the final upshot of the whole situation. This will be an acid test of racial value.*

This will be the final upshot of the whole situation. This will be an acid test of racial value. The race that fails to come through the test will simply die out and its place will be taken by the healthier ant stronger races, which will be able to endure greater hardships. As this problem primarily concerns posterity, it belongs to that category of which it is said with terrible justification that the sins of the fathers are visited on their offspring unto the tenth generation. This is a consequence which follows on an infringement of the laws of blood and race. The sin against blood and race is the hereditary sin in this world and it brings disaster on every nation that commits it.*  

- Page 267 (location ~ 4087-4098)    

*Instead of tackling this problem in a haphazard way, the authorities should leave realised that the happiness or unhappiness of future generations depended on its solution and indeed that the nation’s entire future may, perhaps needs must, depend thereon. To have admitted this would have demanded that active measures be carried out in a ruthless manner. The primary condition would have been that the enlightened attention of the whole country should be concentrated on this terrible danger, so that every individual would realise the importance of fighting against it. It would be futile to impose obligations of a definite character which are often difficult to bear and expect them to become generally effective, unless the public were thoroughly instructed in the necessity of imposing and accepting such obligations. This demands a widespread and systematic method of enlightenment, and all other daily problems that might distract public attention from this great central problem should be relegated to the background.*

*Those who do not endeavour to realise their aims step by step, and who do not concentrate their energy on reaching the individual stages, will never attain the final objective.*  

- Page 269 (location ~ 4115-4116)    

*Therefore, the most essential preliminary condition necessary for an attack on such a difficult stage of the human road is that the authorities should succeed in convincing the masses that the immediate objective which is now being fought for is the only one that deserves to be considered and the only one on which everything depends. The broad masses are never able to see clearly the whole stretch of the road lying in front of them, without becoming tired and thus losing faith in their ability to complete the task. To a certain extent they will keep the objective in mind, but they are only able to survey the whole road in small stages, as in the case of the traveller who knows where his journey is going to end, but who masters the endless stretch far better by attacking it in stages. Only in this way can he keep up his determination and reach the final objective.*

It is in this way, with the assistance of every form of propaganda, that the problem of fighting venereal disease should be placed before the public—not as a task for the nation but as the main task.*  

- Page 269 (location ~ 4118-4125)    

*Every possible means should be employed to bring the truth about this scourge home to the minds of the people, until the whole nation has been convinced that everything depends on the solution of this problem: that is to say, a healthy future or national decay. Only after such preparatory measures have been taken—if necessary, spread over a period of many years—will public attention and public resolution be fully aroused, and only then can serious and definite measures be undertaken without the risk of these not being fully understood or of the authorities being suddenly faced with a slackening of the public will. It must be made clear to all that a serious fight against this scourge calls for vast sacrifices and an enormous amount of work. To wage war against syphilis means fighting against prostitution, against prejudice, against old-established customs, against current fashion, public opinion, and, last but not least, again false prudery in certain circles. The first preliminary condition to be fulfilled, before the State can claim a moral right to fight against all these things, is that the young generation should be afforded facilities for contracting early marriages. Late marriages have the sanction of a custom which, from whatever angle we view it, is, and will remain, a disgrace to humanity, an institution which ill befits a creature who is wont to regard himself as having been fashioned in God’s image.*  

- Page 270 (location ~ 4126-4136)    

*Prostitution is a disgrace to humanity and cannot be removed simply by academic or charitable methods. Its restriction and final extermination presupposes the removal of a whole series of contributory circumstances. The first remedy must always be to establish such conditions as will make early marriages possible, especially for young men—for women are, after all, only the passive factor. An illustration of the extent to which people nowadays are labouring under a delusion, is afforded by the fact that not infrequently one hears mothers in socalled ‘better’ circles openly expressing their satisfaction at having found as a husband for their daughter, a man who has already sown his wild oats, etc. As there is usually so little shortage of men of this type, the poor girl finds no difficulty in getting a mate of this description, and the children of this marriage are a visible result of such supposedly sensible unions. When one realises, apart from this, that every possible effort is being made to hinder the process of procreation and that Nature is being wilfully cheated of her rights, there remains really only one question: Why is such an institution as marriage still in existence, and what are its functions? Is it really nothing better than prostitution? Does our duty to posterity no longer play any part? Or do people not realise the nature of the curse they are inflicting on themselves and their offspring by such criminally foolish neglect of one of the primary laws of Nature? This is how civilised nations degenerate and gradually perish.*

Or do people not realise the nature of the curse they are inflicting on themselves and their offspring by such criminally foolish neglect of one of the primary laws of Nature? This is how civilised nations degenerate and gradually perish. Marriage is not an end in itself but must serve the greater end, which is that of increasing and maintaining the human species and the race. This is its only meaning and purpose. This being admitted, then it is clear that the institution of marriage must be judged by the manner in which its allotted function is fulfilled. Therefore, early marriages should be the rule, because thus the young couple will still have that pristine force which is the fountainhead of a healthy posterity with unimpaired powers of resistance. Of course early marriages cannot be made the rule unless a whole series of social measures are first introduced without which early marriage cannot even be thought of. In other words, a solution of this question, which seems a small problem in itself, cannot be brought about without adopting radical measures to alter the social background.*  

- Page 270 (location ~ 4137-4155)    

*Prostitution, therefore, can only be really seriously tackled if, by means of a radical social reform, early marriage is made easier than hitherto. This is the first preliminary necessity for the solution of this problem. Secondly, a whole series of false notions must be eradicated from our system of bringing up and educating children, a thing which hitherto no one seems to have worried about. In our present educational system a balance will have to be established, first and foremost, between mental instruction and physical training. What is known as the Gymnasium to-day is a positive insult to the Greek institution. Our system of education entirely loses sight of the fact that, in the long run, a healthy mind can exist only in a healthy body. This statement applies with few exceptions, particularly to the broad masses of the nation. In the pre-war Germany there was a time when no one, took the trouble to think over this truth. Training of the body was criminally neglected, the onesided training of the mind being regarded as a sufficient guarantee for the nation’s greatness. This mistake was destined to show its effects sooner than had been anticipated. It is not pure chance that the Bolshevist teaching flourishes in those regions whose degenerate population has been brought to the verge of starvation, as, for example, in the case of Central Germany, Saxony, and the Ruhr.*  

- Page 272 (location ~ 4159-4169)    

*The exclusive intellectualism of the education in vogue among our upper classes makes them unfit for life’s struggle in an epoch in which physical force, and not intellect, is the dominating factor. Thus, they are neither capable of maintaining themselves, nor of making their way in life. In nearly every case physical disability is the forerunner of personal cowardice. The extravagant emphasis laid on purely intellectual education and the consequent neglect of physical training must necessarily lead to sexual thoughts in early youth. Those boys whose constitutions have been trained and hardened by sports and gymnastics are less prone to sexual indulgence than those stay-at-homes who have been fed exclusively with mental pabulum.*  

- Page 273 (location ~ 4172-4177)    

*Thus in every branch of our education the day’s curriculum must be arranged so as to occupy a boy’s free time in profitable development of his physical powers. He has no right in those years to loaf about, becoming a nuisance in public streets and in cinemas; but when his day’s work, is done he ought to harden his young body so that his strength may not be found wanting when the occasion arises. To prepare for this and to carry it out should be the function of our educational system and not exclusively to cram him with knowledge. Our school system must also rid itself of the notion that the training of the body is a task that should be left to the individual himself. There is no such thing as freedom to sin against posterity and thus against the race. The fight against pollution of the mind must be waged simultaneously with the training of the body. To-day the whole of our public life may be compared to a hothouse for the forced growth of sexual notions and excitements. A glance at the till-of-fare provided by our cinemas, playhouses and theatres, suffices to prove that this is not the right food, especially for our young people. Hoardings and advertisement kiosks combine to attract the public in the most vulgar manner.*

*The courts of law throw from, time to time a distressing light on the spiritual life of our fourteen and fifteen-year-old-children. Who, therefore, will be surprised to learn that venereal disease claims as victims at this age? And is it not a frightful scandal to see the number of young men physically weak and intellectually ruined, who have been introduced to the mysteries of marriage by the whores of the big cities? Those who want seriously to combat prostitution must first of all assist in removing the spiritual conditions on which it thrives. They will have to clean up the moral pollution of our city ‘culture’ fearlessly and without regard for the outcry that will follow. If we do not drag our youth out of the morass of their present environment they will be engulfed by it. Those people who do not want to see these things are deliberately encouraging them and are guilty of spreading the effects of prostitution to the future, for the future belongs to our younger generation. This process of cleansing our Kultur will have to be applied in practically all spheres. The stage, art, literature, the cinema, the press and advertisement posters, all must have the stains of pollution removed and be used in the service of a national and cultural ideal.*

*The fight against syphilis and its pacemaker, prostitution, is one of the gigantic tasks of mankind; gigantic, because it is not merely a case of solving a single problem, but of the removal of a whole series of evils which are the contributory causes of this scourge. Disease of the body in this case is merely the result of a diseased condition of the moral, social, and racial instincts. If, for reasons of indolence or cowardice, this fight is not fought to a finish, we may imagine what conditions will be like five centuries hence. Little of God’s image will be left in human nature, except to mock the Creator.*

*Prostitutes were medically examined and controlled as far as possible, and when signs of infection were apparent they were sent to hospital. When outwardly cured, they were once more let loose on humanity. It is true that ‘protective legislation’ was introduced which made sexual intercourse a punishable offence for all those not completely cured, or for those suffering from venereal disease. This legislation was correct in theory, but in practice, it failed completely. In the First place, in the majority of cases women will decline to appear in court as witnesses against men who have robbed them of their health. Women would be exposed far more than men to uncharitable remarks in such cases, and one can imagine what their position would be if they had been infected by their own husbands. Should women in that case bring a charge? Or what should they do? In the case of the man there is the additional fact that he is frequently unfortunate enough to run up against this danger when he is under the influence of alcohol. His condition makes it impossible for him to assess the qualities of his ‘amorous beauty,’ a fact which is well known to every diseased prostitute and makes her single out men in this ‘ideal’ condition for preference. The result is that the unfortunate man is not able to recollect later on who his compassionate benefactress was, which is not surprising in cities like Berlin and Munich.*

*Sixty years ago an exhibition of socalled Dadaist ‘experiences’ would have been an absolutely preposterous idea. The organisers of such an exhibition would then have been certified fit for the lunatic asylum, whereas to-day they are appointed presidents of art societies. At that time such an epidemic would never have been allowed to spread. Public opinion would not have tolerated it, and the government would not have remained silent, for it is the duty of a government to save the people from being driven into such intellectual madness. Intellectual madness would have resulted from a development that followed the acceptance of this kind of art. It would have marked one of the worst changes in human history, for it would have meant that a retrogressive process had begun to take place in the human brain, the final stages of which would have been unthinkable. If we study the course of our cultural life during the last twenty-five years we shall be astonished to note how far we have already gone in this process of retrogression.*

*A sad symptom of internal decay was manifested in the fact that it was impossible to allow adolescents to frequent most of these socalled ‘centres of art,’ a brazen admission that this was so, being the notice exhibited at the entrance-doors: Adults only. Let it be borne in mind that these precautions had to be taken in regard to institutions whose main purpose should have been to promote the education of the youth and not merely to provide amusement for sophisticated adults. What would the great dramatists of other times have said of such measures and, above all, of the conditions which made these measures necessary? How exasperated Schiller would have been, and how Goethe would have turned away in disgust! But what are Schiller, Goethe and Shakespeare when confronted with the heroes of our modern German literature? Old, frowsy, outmoded and finished, for it was typical of this epoch that not only were its own products bad, but that it reviled everything that had been really great in the past. This is a phenomenon that is very characteristic of such epochs. The more vile and miserable the men and products of an epoch, the more they will hate and denigrate the ideal achievements of former generations.*  

- Page 279 (location ~ 4269-4278)    

*the more lamentable and wretched the products of each new era, the more it will try to obliterate all the memorials of the past. Any real innovation that is for the benefit of mankind can always face comparison with the best of what has gone before, and frequently even serves to reveal the true value of the latter. There is no fear that modem productions of real value will look pale and worthless beside the monuments of the past. What is contributed to the general treasury of human culture often fulfils a part that is necessary in order to keep the memory of old achievements alive, because this memory alone is the standard whereby our own works are properly appreciated. Only those who have nothing of value to give to the world, but pretend that they have much to bestow, will oppose everything that already exists and would have it destroyed at all costs. This holds good not only for new phenomena in the cultural domain, but also in politics. The more inferior new revolutionary movements are, the more will they try to denigrate the old forms. Here again the desire to palm off their shoddy products as great and original achievements leads them into a blind hatred against everything which belongs to the past and which is superior to their own work.*  

- Page 280 (location ~ 4280-4289)    

*One has good reason to be suspicious in regard to any new idea, or any doctrine or philosophy, any political or economic movement, which tries to deny everything that the past has produced or to represent it as inferior and worthless. Such an antipathy is usually due to a sense of inferiority or to malicious intention. Any new movement which is really beneficial to human progress will always have to begin its constructive work at the level at which the last stones of the structure have been laid. It need not blush to utilise those truths which have already been established, for all human culture, as well as man himself, is only the result of one long line of development, where each generation has contributed its share in the building of the whole structure. The meaning and purpose of revolutions cannot be to tear down the whole building, but to take away what has not been well fitted into it or is unsuitable, and to fill in the gap thus caused, after which the main construction of the building will be carried on.*

*The saddest feature of the condition in which our whole civilisation found itself before the War was the fact that it was not only barren of any creative force to produce its own works of art and civilisation but that it hated, defiled and tried to efface the memory of the superior works produced in the past. About the end of the last century people were less interested in producing new significant works of their own—particularly in the fields of dramatic art and literature—than in defaming the best works of the past and in presenting them as inferior and antiquated. As if this period of disgraceful decadence was capable of accomplishing anything! The efforts made to conceal the past from the eyes of the present afforded clear evidence of the fact that these apostles of the future acted from an evil intent. These symptoms*

As if this period of disgraceful decadence was capable of accomplishing anything! The efforts made to conceal the past from the eyes of the present afforded clear evidence of the fact that these apostles of the future acted from an evil intent.*

*The few that could really be called great cities were mostly the residential cities of princes; as such they had almost always a definite cultural value and also a definite cultural aspect. Those few towns which had more than fifty thousand inhabitants were, in comparison with modern cities of the same size, rich in scientific and artist, treasures. At the time when Munich had a population of not more than sixty thousand souls it was already well on the way to becoming one of the first centres of German art. Nowadays, almost every industrial town has a population at least as large as that, without having anything of real value to call its own. They are agglomerations of tenement houses and congested dwelling-houses, and nothing else. It would be a miracle if anybody should grow sentimentally attached to such a meaningless place. Nobody can grow attached to a place which offers only just as much, or as little, as any other place would offer, which, has no character of its own and where obviously pains have been taken to avoid everything that might have any resemblance to an artistic appearance. But this is not all. Even the great cities become more barren of real works of art the more they increase in population. They assume more and more a neutral atmosphere and present the same aspect, though on a larger scale, as the wretched little factory towns. Everything that our modern age has contributed to the cultural aspect of our great cities is absolutely deficient. All our towns are living on the glory and the treasures of the past. If we take away from the Munich of to-day everything that was created under Ludwig I, we should be horror-stricken to see how meagre has been the output of important artistic creations since that time.*

*When we compare the size of those ancient public buildings with that of the private*

*What struck the eye of the individual citizen was not a number of mediocre private buildings, but imposing structures that belonged to the whole community. In contradistinction to these, private dwellings were of only very secondary importance indeed. When we compare the size of those ancient public buildings with that of the private dwellings belonging to the same epoch, then we can understand the great importance which was attached to the principle that those works which reflected and affected the life of the community should take precedence of all others. Among the broken arches and vast spaces that are covered with ruins from the ancient world the colossal monuments which still arouse our wonder have not been left to us from the commercial palaces of those days but from the temples of the gods and the public edifices that belonged to the State. The community itself was the owner of those great edifices. Even in the pomp of Rome during the decadence it was not the villas and palaces of the citizens that occupied the most prominent place, but rather the temples and the baths, the stadia, the circuses, the aqueducts, the basilicas, etc., which belonged to the State and therefore to the people as a whole.*  

- Page 285 (location ~ 4359-4368)    

*In medieval Germany also, the same principle held good, although the artistic outlook was quite different. In ancient times the theme that found its expression in the Acropolis or the Pantheon was now clothed in the form of the Gothic Cathedral. In the medieval cities these monumental structures towered gigantically above the swarm of smaller buildings, with their framework walls of wood and brick, and they remain the dominant feature of these cities even to our own day, although they are becoming more and more obscured by the tenement houses. They determine the character and appearance of the locality. Cathedrals, city halls, corn-exchanges, forts, are the outward expression of an idea which has its counterpart only in the ancient world. The dimensions and quality of our public buildings to-day are in deplorable contrast to the edifices that, represent private interests. If a similar fate should befall Berlin as befell Rome, future generations might gaze upon the ruins of some Jewish department stores or joint-stock hotels and think that these were the characteristic expressions of the culture of our time. In Berlin itself, compare the shameful disproportion between the buildings which belong to the Reich and those which have been erected for the accommodation of trade and finance. The funds that are voted for public buildings are in most cases inadequate and really ridiculous. They are not built as structures that were meant to last, but mostly for the purpose of answering the need of the moment.*

*All these symptoms which preceded the final collapse of the Second Reich must be attributed to the lack of a definite and uniformly accepted Weltanschauung and the general uncertainty of outlook consequent on that lack. This uncertainty showed itself when the great questions of the time had to be considered one after another and a decisive policy adopted towards them. This lack is also .accountable for the habit of doing everything by halves, beginning with the educational system, the shilly-shallying, the reluctance to undertake responsibility and, finally, the cowardly tolerance of evils that were even admitted to be destructive. Visionary humanitarianism became the fashion. By weakly submitting to these aberrations and sparing the feelings of the individual, the future of millions of human beings was sacrificed. An examination of the religious situation before the War shows that the general process of disruption had extended to this sphere also. A great part of the nation itself had, for a long time past, ceased to have any convictions of a uniform and practical character in their ideological outlook on life.*  

- Page 287 (location ~ 4391-4400)    

*While the two Christian denominations maintained missions in Asia and Africa, for the purpose of securing new adherents to the faith, these same denominations were losing millions and millions of their adherents at home in Europe. These former adherents either gave up religion wholly as a directive force in their lives, or they adopted their own interpretation of it. The consequences of this were specially felt in the moral life of the country. In parenthesis it may be remarked that the progress made by the missions in spreading the Christian faith abroad was very modest in comparison with the spread of Mohammedanism. It must be noted, too, that the attack on the dogmatic principles underlying ecclesiastical teaching increased steadily in violence, and yet this human world of ours would be inconceivable without the practical existence of a religious belief. The great masses of a nation are not composed of philosophers. For the masses of the people especially, faith is absolutely the only basis of a moral Weltanschauung. The various substitutes that have been offered have not shown any results that might warrant us in thinking that they might usefully replace the existing denominations, but if religious teaching and religious faith are to be accepted by the broad masses as active forces in their lives, then the absolute authority of the doctrines of faith must be the foundation of all reality.*

*There may be a few hundreds of thousands of superior men who can live wisely and intelligently without depending on the general standards that prevail in everyday life, but the millions of others cannot do so. Now, the place which general custom fills in everyday life, corresponds to that of general laws in the State and dogma in religion. The purely spiritual idea is of itself a changeable thing that may be subjected to endless interpretations. It is only through dogma that it is given a precise and concrete form without which it could not become a living faith. Otherwise, the spiritual idea would never become anything more than a mere metaphysical concept, or rather a philosophical opinion. Accordingly, the attack on dogma is comparable to an attack on the general laws on which the State is founded, and so this attack would finally lead to complete political anarchy if it were successful, just as the attack on religion would lead to a worthless religious nihilism.*

*The greatest damage of all has come from the practice of abusing religious conviction in order to further political aims. Most severe measures should be adopted against these miserable swindlers who look on religion merely as a means that can be exploited to serve political interests, or rather commercial ends. The impudent and loud-mouthed liars who do this make their profession of faith before the whole world in stentorian tones so that all poor mortals may hear-not that they are ready to die for it if necessary, but rather that they may live all the better. They are ready to sell their faith for any political quid pro quo. For ten parliamentary mandates they would ally themselves with the Marxists, who are the mortal foes of all religion, and for a seat in the Cabinet they would go the length of wedlock with the devil, if the latter had not still retained some traces of decency which would lead him to refuse. If religious life in pre-war Germany had a disagreeable savour in the mouths of many people, this was because Christianity had been lowered to base uses by political parties that called themselves Christian and because of the shameful way in which they tried to identify the Catholic Faith with a political party. This substitution was fatal. It procured some worthless*

*Many people who took a gloomy view of things at that time condemned the lack of ideas and lack of orientation which were evident in directing the policy of the Reich. They recognised the inner weakness and futility of this policy, but such people played only a secondary role in politics. Those who had the government of the country in their hands were quite as indifferent to principles of civil wisdom laid down by thinkers like Houston Stewart Chamberlain as are our political leaders to-day. These people are too stupid to think for themselves, and they have too much self-conceit to take from others the instruction which they need. Oxenstierna gave expression to a truth which has lasted since time immemorial, when he said that the world is governed by only a particle of wisdom, and it can be said of practically every higher government official that he represents but a tiny atom of this particle.*

*One of the silliest notions that one hears expressed to-day is that in Germany the parliamentary system has proved a failure since the Revolution. This might easily be taken to imply that the case was different before the Revolution, but in reality the parliamentary system can never function except to the detriment of the country, and it functioned thus in those days when people saw nothing or did not wish to see anything. The German downfall is to be attributed in no small degree, to this system, but that the catastrophe did not take place sooner is not to the credit of the Reichstag, but rather to those who opposed the influence of this institution which, during peace time, was digging the grave of the German Nation and the German Reich. From the immense mass of devastating evils that were due either directly or indirectly to the Reichstag, I shall select the one most intimately typical of this institution which was the most irresponsible of all time.*  

- Page 291 (location ~ 4461-4469)    

*On the most miserable of pretexts these parliamentary party-henchmen filched from the hands of the nation and threw away, the weapons which were needed to maintain its existence and thereby defend the liberty and independence of our people. If the graves on the plains of Flanders were to open to-day the blood-stained accusers would arise, hundreds of thousands of our best German youth who, thanks to those conscienceless parliamentary criminals were delivered, badly trained or only half-trained, into the arms of Death. Those youths and other millions of the killed and mutilated were lost to the Fatherland simply and solely in order that a few hundred deceivers of the people might carry out their political manoeuvres and their exactions, or even continue to recite their doctrinaire theories. By means of the Marxist and democratic press, the Jews spread the colossal falsehood about ‘German militarism’ throughout the world and tried to inculpate Germany by every possible means, while at the same time the Marxist and democratic parties refused to assent to the measures that were necessary for the adequate training of our national defence forces.*

*the smaller proportions of the German vessels could be maintained only at the expense of speed and armament. The phrase used to justify this policy was in itself evidence of the lack of logical thinking on the part of the naval authorities who were in charge of these matters in times of peace. They declared that the German guns were definitely superior to the British, so that the German 28 cm. gun was just as effective as the British 30.5 cm. gun. But that was just why they should have adopted the policy of building 30.5 cm. guns also; for it ought to have been their object not to achieve equality, but superiority, in fighting strength. If that were not so, then it would have been superfluous to equip the land forces with 42 cm. mortars, since the German 21 cm. mortar was far superior to any high-angle guns which the French possessed at that time and consequently the fortresses could probably have been taken by means of 30.cm. mortars. The army authorities calculated correctly, the naval authorities unfortunately failed to do so. If they were willing to forego superiority of armaments as well as of speed, this was because of the fundamentally false ‘principle of risk’ which they adopted. The naval authorities, even in times of peace, renounced the principle of attack and thus had to follow a defensive policy from the very beginning of the war, but by this attitude they renounced also the chances of final success, which can be achieved only by taking the offensive.*  

- Page 294 (location ~ 4506-4517)    

*Japan had followed a different kind of naval policy. There, as a matter of principle, care was taken to create with every single new vessel a fighting force that would be superior to that of the eventual adversaries, but because of this policy, it was afterwards possible to use the fleet for the offensive. While the army authorities refused to adopt such fundamentally erroneous principles, the Navy—which unfortunately had more representatives in parliament—succumbed to the spirit that ruled there. The Navy was not organised on a strong basis, and it was later used in an unsystematic and irresolute way.*

*In comparison with traitors who betrayed the nation’s trust, every other kind of twister may be looked upon as an honourable man. It was a peculiar feature of the situation that all the real faults of the old Germany were exposed to the public gaze only when the inner solidarity of the nation could be injured by doing so. Then indeed unpleasant truths were openly proclaimed in the ears of the broad masses, while many other things were at other times shamefully hushed up or their existence simply denied, especially at times when an open discussion of such problems might have led to an improvement. The higher government authorities knew little or nothing of the nature and use of propaganda in such matters. Only the Jew knew that by an able and persistent use of propaganda, heaven itself can be presented to the people as if it were hell and, vice versa, the most miserable kind of life can be presented as if it were paradise.*

*Chief among Germany’s advantages was the fact that, of all the European nations, the German nation was almost the only one which had made a great effort to preserve the national character of its economic structure and for this reason was less subject than other countries to the power of international finance, though indeed there were many untoward symptoms in this regard also, and yet this advantage was a perilous one and turned out later to be one of the chief causes of the World War. Even if we disregard this advantage of national independence in economic matters, there were certain other positive features of our social and political life which were of outstanding excellence. These features were represented by three institutions which were constant sources of regeneration. In their respective spheres they were models of perfection and efficiency.*

*It must be admitted that the monarchy had become alien in spirit to many citizens and especially to the broad masses. This resulted from the fact that the monarchs were not always surrounded by, let us say, the highest intellect and certainly not always by persons of the most upright character. Unfortunately, many of them preferred flatterers to honest-spoken men and hence received their ‘information’ from the former. This was a source of grave danger at a time when the world was passing through a period in which many of the old conditions were changing and when this change was affecting even the traditions of the Court. The average man or woman could not have felt any particular enthusiasm when, for example, at the close of the century, a princess in uniform and on horseback had the soldiers file past her on parade. Those high circles had apparently no idea of the impression which such a parade made on the minds of ordinary people, else such unfortunate occurrences would not have taken place.*

*There is only one word to express what the German people owes to this Army—everything! It was the Army that still kept a sense of responsibility alive among the people when this quality had become very rare and when the, habit of shirking every kind of responsibility was steadily spreading. This habit had grown up under the evil influences of parliament, which was itself the very model of irresponsibility. The Army trained the people to personal courage at a time when the virtue of timidity threatened to become an epidemic and when the spirit of sacrificing one’s personal interests for the good of the community was considered as something that amounted almost to weak-mindedness. At a time when only those were estimated as intelligent who knew how to safeguard and promote their own egotistic interests, the Army was the school through which individual Germans were taught not to seek the salvation of their nation in the false ideology of international fraternisation between Negroes, Germans, Chinese, French and English, etc., but in the strength and unity of their own national being.*  

- Page 301 (location ~ 4613-4621)    

*Since our upper classes were really ignorant of what was going on in the body corporate of the nation and were becoming more and more estranged from the life of the people, the Army would have accomplished a very beneficial mission if it had refused to discriminate in favour of the socalled intellectuals, especially within its own ranks. It was a mistake that this was not done, but can we in this world of ours find any institution that has nit at least one defect? And in the Army, the good features were so absolutely predominant that the few defects it had, were far below the average that generally arises from human weakness. The greatest merit of the Army of the old Reich was that, at a time when the person of the individual counted for nothing and the majority was everything, it placed individual personal values above majority values. By insisting on its faith in personality, the Army opposed that typically Jewish and democratic apotheosis of the power of numbers. The Army trained what at that time was most sorely needed, namely, real men. During a period when men were falling prey to effeminacy and laxity, three hundred and fifty thousand vigorously trained young men went forth from the ranks of the Army each year.*  

- Page 303 (location ~ 4636-4645)    

*The wonderful might and power of the old Reich was based on the monarchical form of government, the Army and the civil service, of these three foundations rested that great strength which is now entirely lacking, namely, the authority of the State, for the authority of the State cannot be based on the babbling that goes on in parliament or in the provincial diets, upon laws made to protect the State, or upon sentences passed by the law courts to frighten those who have had the hardihood to deny the authority of the State, but only on the general confidence which the management and administration of the community establishes among the people. This confidence is, in its turn, nothing else than the result of an unshakable inner conviction that the government and administration of a country is inspired by disinterested and honest goodwill and of the feeling that the Spirit of the law is in complete harmony with the moral convictions of the people. In the long run, systems of government are not maintained by terrorism but by the belief of the people in the merits and sincerity of those who are there to administer and promote public interests.*

*Walking about in the garden of Nature, most men have the self-conceit to think that they know everything, yet almost all are blind to one of the outstanding principles that Nature employs in her work. This principle may be called the inner isolation which characterises each and every living species on this earth. Even a superficial glance is sufficient to show that all the innumerable forms in which the life-urge of Nature manifests itself are subject to a fundamental law—one may call it an iron law of Nature—which compels the various species to keep within the definite limits of their own life-forms when propagating and multiplying their kind. Each animal mates only with one of its own species. The titmouse cohabits only with the titmouse, the finch with the finch, the stork with the stork, the field-mouse with the field-mouse, the house-mouse with the house-mouse, the wolf with the she-wolf, etc. Deviations from this law take place only in exceptional circumstances. This happens especially under the compulsion of captivity, or when some other obstacle makes procreative intercourse impossible between individuals of the same species. Nature abhors such irregular intercourse with all her might and her protest is most clearly demonstrated by the fact that the hybrid is either sterile, or the fecundity of its descendants is limited. In most cases hybrids and their progeny are denied the ordinary powers of resistance to disease or the natural means of defence against attack. Such a dispensation of Nature is quite logical. Every crossing of two breeds which are not, of equal standing results in a product which holds an intermediate place between the levels of the two parents.*  

- Page 306 (location ~ 4688-4701)    

*The stronger must dominate and not mate with the weaker, which would signify the sacrifice of its own higher nature. Only the born weakling can look upon this principle as cruel, and if he does so, it is merely because he is of a feebler nature and narrower mind, for if such a law did not direct the process of evolution then the higher development of organic life would not be conceivable at all. This urge for the maintenance of the unmixed breed which is a phenomenon that prevails throughout the whole of the natural world, results not only in the sharply defined outward distinction between one species and another, but also in the internal similarity of characteristic qualities which are peculiar to each breed or species.*

The fox remains always a fox, the goose remains a goose, and the tiger will retain the character of a tiger. The only difference that can exist within the species is in the various degrees of structural strength and active power, in the intelligence, efficiency, endurance, etc., with which the individual specimens are endowed. It would be impossible to find a fox which has a kindly and protective disposition towards geese, just as no cat exists which has a friendly disposition towards mice.*

*more rapidly if they possessed the same capacity for survival and for the procreation of their*

*Since the inferior always outnumber the superior, the former would always increase more rapidly if they possessed the same capacity for survival and for the procreation of their kind, and the final consequence would be that the best in quality would be forced to recede into the background. Therefore, a corrective measure must intervene in favour of the better quality. Nature supplies this by establishing rigorous conditions of life, to which the weaker will have to submit and will thereby be numerically restricted, but even that portion which survives cannot multiply indiscriminately, for here a new and rigorous selection takes place, according to strength and health. If Nature does not wish that weaker individuals should mate with stronger, she wishes even less that a superior race should intermingle with an inferior one, because in such a case all her efforts, throughout hundreds of thousands of years, to establish an evolutionary higher stage of being, may be rendered futile.*

*In North America, where the population is prevalently Teutonic, and where those elements intermingled with the inferior race only to a very small degree, we have a quality of mankind and a civilisation which are different from those of Central and South America. In these latter countries the immigrants—who belonged mainly to the Latin races—mated with the aborigines, sometimes to a very large extent indeed. In this case, we have a clear and decisive example of the effect produced by the mixture of races. In North America the Teutonic element, which has kept its racial stock pure and did not mix it with any other racial stock, has come to dominate the American Continent and will remain master of it as long as that element does not fall a victim to the habit of adulterating its blood. In short, the results of miscegenation are always the following: (a) The level of the superior race becomes lowered. (b) Physical and mental degeneration sets in, thus leading slowly but steadily towards a progressive drying up of the vital, sap. The act which brings about such a development is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator, and as a sin this act will be avenged. Man’s effort to build up something that contradicts the iron logic of Nature brings him into conflict with those principles to which he himself exclusively, owes his own existence. By acting against the laws of Nature he prepares the way that leads to his ruin. Here we meet with the insolent objection, which is Jewish in its inspiration and is typical of the modem pacifist, that “Man can overcome Nature.”*

*Apart from all this, an idea can never subject to its own sway those condition; which are necessary for the existence and development of mankind, for the idea itself has come only from man. Without man there would be no human idea in this world. The idea as such is, therefore, always dependent on the existence of man and is consequently dependent on those laws which furnish the conditions of his existence. Not only that.

This idea could have an injurious effect only in the measure in which its application became difficult and finally impossible. So, first of all, the fight, and then pacifism. If it were otherwise, it would mean that mankind has already passed the zenith of its development, and accordingly, the end would not be the supremacy of some moral ideal, but degeneration into barbarism and consequent chaos. People may laugh at this statement, but our planet moved through space for millions of years, uninhabited by men, and at some future date may easily begin to do so again, if men should forget that wherever they have reached a superior level of existence, it was not as a result of following the ideas of crazy visionaries but by acknowledging and rigorously observing the iron laws of Nature. What reduces one race to starvation stimulates another to harder work. All the great civilisations of the past became decadent because the originally creative race died out, as a result of contamination of the blood. The most profound cause of such a decline is to be found in the fact that the people ignored the principle that all culture depends on men, and not the reverse.*

*Loaded with the burden of human sentiment, he falls back to the level of a helpless animal. It would be futile to attempt to discuss the question as to what race or races were the original champions of human culture and were thereby the real founders of all that we understand by the word ‘humanity.’ It is much simpler to deal with this question in so far as it relates to the present time. Here the answer is simple and clear. Every manifestation of human culture, every product of art, science and technical skill, which we see before our eyes to-day, is almost, exclusively the product of the Aryan creative power. All that we admire in the world to-day, its science and its art, its technical developments and discoveries, are the products of the creative activities of a few peoples, and it may be true that their first beginnings must be attributed to one race. The existence of civilisation is wholly dependent on such peoples. Should they perish, all that makes this earth beautiful will descend with them into the grave. However great, for example, be the influence which the soil exerts on men, this influence will always vary according to the race on which it produces its effect. Dearth of soil may stimulate one race to the most strenuous efforts and highest achievements; while, for another race, the poverty of the soil may be the cause of misery, and finally of undernourishment, with all its consequence. This very fact fully justifies the conclusion that it was the Aryan alone who founded a superior type of humanity; therefore he represents the archetype of what, we understand by the term: MAN.*

*Within a few decades the whole of Eastern Asia, for instance, appropriated a culture and called this culture its own, whereas the basis of that culture was the Greek mind and Teutonic technical skill as we know it. Only the external form—at least to a certain degree—shows the traits of an Asiatic inspiration. It is not true, as some believe, that Japan adds European technology to a culture of her own. The truth rather is that European science and technology are just decked out with the peculiar characteristics of Japanese civilisation. The foundations of actual life in Japan to-day are not those of the native Japanese culture, although this characterises the external features of the country, which features strike the eye of European observers on account of their fundamental difference from our own; but the real foundations of contemporary Japanese life are the enormous scientific and technical achievements of Europe and America, that is to say, of Aryan peoples. Only by adopting these achievements as the foundations of their own progress can the various nations of the Orient take a place in contemporary world progress. The scientific and technical achievements of Europe and America provide the basis on which the struggle for daily livelihood is carried on in the Orient.*

*We may, therefore, draw the conclusion that, just as the present Japanese development has been due to Aryan influence, so in the immemorial past an outside influence and an outside culture brought into existence the Japanese culture of that day. This opinion is very strongly supported by the fact that the ancient civilisation of Japan actually became fossilised and petrified. Such a process can take place only if a people loses the racial cell which had originally been creative, or if the outside influence should be withdrawn after having awakened and maintained the first cultural developments in that region. If it be shown that a people owes the fundamental elements of its culture to foreign races, assimilating and elaborating such elements, and if subsequently that culture becomes fossilised whenever the external influence ceases, then such a race may be called the champion, but never the creator, of a culture. If we subject the different peoples to a strict test from this standpoint, we shall find that scarcely any one of them has originally created a culture, but almost all have been merely the recipients of a culture created elsewhere. This development may be depicted as always happening*

*In so far as the blood of the former ruling race has left a light nuance of colour in the blood of its descendants, as a token and a memory, the night of cultural life is rendered less dim and dark by a mild light radiated from the products of those who were the bearers of the original fire. Their radiance shines across the barbarism to which the subjected race has reverted and might often lead the superficial observer to believe that he sees before him an image of the present race, when he is really looking into a mirror, wherein only the past is reflected. It may happen that in the course of their history such a people will come into contact a second time, and even oftener, with the original founders of their culture and may not even remember that distant association. Instinctively, the remnants of blood, left from that old ruling race will be drawn towards this new phenomenon, and what had formerly been possible only under compulsion, can now be successfully achieved in a voluntary way. A new cultural wave flows in and lasts until the blood of those who brought it becomes once again adulterated by intermixture with the originally conquered race. It will be the task of those who set themselves to write a universal history of civilisation, to investigate history from this point of view instead of allowing themselves to be smothered under the mass of external data, as is only too often the case with our present historical science.*

*Just as in our daily life the socalled man of genius needs a particular occasion, and sometimes needs a special stimulus to bring his genius to light, so too, in the life of the peoples the race that has genius in it needs the occasion and stimulus to give that genius expression. In the monotony and routine of everyday life even persons of significance seem just like the others and do not rise beyond the average level of their fellow-men, but as soon as such men find themselves in a special situation which disconcerts and unbalances the others, the humble person of apparently common qualities reveals traits of genius often to the amazement of those who have hitherto known him in the petty round of everyday life. That is the reason why a prophet is seldom honoured in his own country. War offers an excellent occasion for observing this phenomenon. In times of distress, when the others despair, apparently harmless, boys suddenly spring up and become heroes, full of determination, undaunted in the presence of Death and manifesting wonderful powers of calm reflection in such circumstances. If such an hour of trial did not come, nobody would have thought that the soul of a hero lurked in the body of that beardless youth. A special impulse is, almost always necessary to bring a man of genius into the foreground.*  

- Page 317 (location ~ 4852-4861)    

*Though an inventor, for example, does not establish his fame until the very day on which he completes his invention, it would be a mistake to believe that the creative genius did not become alive in him until that moment. From the very hour of his birth the spark of genius is alive within the man who has been endowed with the real creative faculty. True genius is an innate quality. It can never be the result of education or training. As I have stated already, this holds good not merely of the individual, but also of the race. Those peoples who manifest creative ability in certain periods of their history have always been fundamentally creative. It belongs to their very nature, even though this fact may escape the eyes of the superficial observer. Here also, recognition from outside is only the consequence of practical achievement. Since the rest of the world is incapable of recognising genius as such, it can only see the visible manifestations of genius in the form of inventions, discoveries, buildings, painting, etc., but even here a long time passes before recognition is given.*

*The remark that the Moor, having lone his duty, could now go, can, unfortunately, be applied more or less universally. For thousands of years the horse has been the faithful servant of man and has helped him to lay the foundations of human progress; but now, motor power has rendered the horse superfluous. In a few years’ time the use of the horse will cease entirely; and yet without its collaboration man could scarcely have reached the stage of development at which he now is. For the establishment of superior types of civilisation the members of inferior races formed one of the most essential prerequisites. They alone could supply the lack of mechanical means, without which no progress is possible. It is certain that the first stages of human civilisation were not based so much on the use of tame animals as on the employment of human beings who were members of an inferior race.*  

- Page 319 (location ~ 4886-4893)    

*The progress of mankind may be compared to the process of ascending an infinite ladder. One does not reach the higher level without first having climbed the lower rungs. The Aryan, therefore, had to take that road which his sense of reality pointed out to him, and not that of which the modern pacifist dreams. The path of reality is, however, difficult and hard to tread; yet it is the only one which finally leads to the goal where the others envisage mankind in their dreams. The real truth is that those dreamers help to lead man away from his goal rather than towards it. It was not by mere chance that the first forms of civilisation arose where the Aryan came into contact with inferior races, subjugated them and forced them to obey his command. The members of the inferior race became the first mechanical tools in the service of a growing civilisation. Thereby the way was clearly indicated which the Aryan had to follow. As a conqueror, he subjugated inferior races and turned their physical powers into organised channels under his own leadership, forcing them to follow his will and purpose. By imposing on them a useful, though hard, manner of employing their powers, he not only spared the lives of those whom he had conquered, but probably made their lives easier than they had been in the former state of socalled ‘freedom.’ While he ruthlessly maintained his, position as their master, he not only remained master, but he also preserved and advanced civilisation, for this depended exclusively on his inborn abilities and, therefore, on the preservation of the Aryan race as such. As soon, however, as his subjects began to rise and approach the level of their conqueror, a phase of which ascension was probably the use of his language, the barriers that had distinguished master from servant broke down. The Aryan neglected to maintain his own racial stock unmixed and thereby lost the right to live in the paradise which he himself had created. He became submerged in the racial mixture and gradually lost his cultural creativeness, until he finally grew, not only mentally but also physically, more like the aborigines whom he had subjected, rather than his own ancestors. For some time he could continue to live on the capital of that culture which still remained; but a condition of fossilisation soon set in and he sank into oblivion.*  

- Page 320 (location ~ 4897-4915)    

*Among the most primitive organisms the instinct for self-preservation does not extend beyond the care of the individual ego. Egotism, as we call this passion, is so predominant that it includes even the time element, which means that the present moment is deemed the most important and that nothing is left to the future. The animal lives only for itself, searching for food only when it feels hunger, and fighting only for the preservation of its own life. As long as the instinct for self-preservation manifests itself exclusively in such a way, there is no basis for the establishment of a community, not even the most primitive form of all, that is to say, the family. The community formed by the male with the female, where it goes beyond the mere conditions of mating, calls for the extension of the instinct of self-preservation, since the readiness to fight for one’s own ego has to be extended also to the mate. The male sometimes provides food for the female, but in most cases both parents provide food for the offspring. Almost always they are ready to protect and defend each other, so that here we find the first, though infinitely simple, manifestation of the spirit of sacrifice.*  

- Page 322 (location ~ 4924-4933)    

*The greatness of the Aryan is not based on his intellectual powers, but rather on his willingness to devote all his faculties to the service of the community. Here the instinct for self-preservation has reached its noblest form, for the Aryan willingly subordinates his own ego to the common weal and, when necessity calls, he will even sacrifice his own life for the community. The constructive powers of the Aryan and that peculiar ability he has for the building up of a culture are not grounded in his intellectual gifts alone.*  

- Page 323 (location ~ 4938-4942)    

*By serving the common weal he receives his reward in return; he does not, for example, work directly for himself but makes his productive work a part of the activity of the group to which he belongs, not only for his own benefit but for the general welfare. The spirit underlying this attitude is expressed by the word, WORK which to him does not at all signify a means of earning one’s daily livelihood but rather a productive activity which cannot clash with the interests of the community. Whenever human activity, is directed exclusively to the service of the instinct for self-preservation, regardless of the general weal, it is called theft, usury, robbery, burglary, and so on. This mental attitude, which forces self-interest to recede into the background in favour of the common weal, is the first prerequisite for any kind of really human civilisation. It is out of this spirit alone that great human achievements have sprung, for which the original doers have scarcely ever received any recompense, but which turn out to be the source of abundant benefit for their descendants.*  

- Page 323 (location ~ 4944-4953)    

*Every worker, every peasant, every inventor, every government official, etc., who works without ever achieving fortune or prosperity for himself, is a representative of this sublime ideal, even though he may never become conscious of the profound meaning of his own activity. Everything that may be said of that kind of work which is the fundamental condition for providing food and the basic means of human progress is true even in a higher sense of work that is done for the protection of man and his civilisation. The renunciation of one’s own life for the sake of the community is the crowning significance of the idea of all sacrifice. In this way only is it possible to protect what has been built up by man and to ensure that this will not be destroyed by the hand of man or of Nature. In the German language we have a word which admirably expresses the significance underlying all work. It is Pflichterfüllung (fulfilment of duty), which means the service of the common weal before the consideration of one’s own interests. The fundamental spirit out of which this kind of activity springs is the reverse of ‘egotism,’ and we call it ‘idealism.’ By this we mean to signify the willingness of the individual to, make sacrifices for the community and his fellow-men.*  

- Page 324 (location ~ 4955-4965)    

*Since true idealism, however, is essentially the subordination of the interests and life of the individual to the interests and life of the community, and since this subordination in turn represents the prerequisite condition for every form of organisation, this idealism accords in its innermost essence with the final purpose of Nature. This idealism alone makes men voluntarily acknowledge, that strength and power are entitled to take the lead and makes them a constituent particle of that order out of which the whole universe is shaped and formed. Without being conscious of it, the purest idealism is always associated with the most profound knowledge. How True this is and how little genuine idealism has to do with fantastic self-dramatization will become clear the moment we ask an unspoilt child, a healthy boy, for example, to give his opinion. The very same boy who listens to the rantings of an ‘idealistic’ pacifist without understanding them, and even rejects them, would readily sacrifice his young life for the ideal of his people.*

*It is an essential aspect of human evolution that the individual should be imbued with the spirit of sacrifice in favour of the common weal that he: should not be influenced by the morbid notions of those who pretend to know better than Nature and who have the impudence to criticise her decrees. It is just at those junctures when the idealistic attitude threatens to disappear that we notice a weakening of this force which is a necessary constituent in the founding and maintenance of the community and is therefore a necessary condition of civilisation. As soon as the spirit of egotism begins to prevail among a people, then the bonds of the social order break, and man, by seeking his own personal happiness, tumbles out of heaven and falls into hell. Posterity will not remember those who pursued only their own individual interests, but it will praise those heroes who renounced their own happiness. The Jew offers the most striking contrast to the Aryan. There is probably no other people in the world which has so developed the instinct of self-preservation as the socalled ‘chosen’ race. The best proof of this statement is to be found in the simple fact that this race still exists. Where is another people to be found that in the course of the last two thousand years has undergone so few changes in mental, outlook and character as the ‘Jewish people? And yet what other people has played such a constant part in the great revolutions? Even after having passed through the most gigantic catastrophes that have overwhelmed mankind, the Jews remain the same as ever. What an infinitely tenacious will to live, to preserve one’s kind, is demonstrated by that fact! The intellectual faculties of the Jew have been trained throughout thousands of years. To-day the Jew is looked upon as especially ‘clever’ and in a certain sense, he has been so throughout the ages. His intellectual powers, however, are not the result of an inner evolution but have rather been shaped by the object lessons which he has received from others. The human spirit cannot climb upwards without taking successive steps. For every step upwards it needs the foundation of what has been constructed before, namely, the past, which, in the comprehensive sense here employed, can have been laid only by a general civilisation.*  

- Page 325 (location ~ 4982-5000)    

*The boy of to-day, for example, grows up among such an overwhelming mass of technical achievement, which has accumulated during the last century, that he takes for granted many things which, a hundred years ago, were still mysteries even to the greatest minds of those times. Yet these things that are now so much a matter of course are of enormous importance to those who would understand the progress we have made in certain spheres and would carry that progress a step farther. If a man of genius belonging to the twenties of the last century were to rise from his grave to-day, he would find it more difficult to understand our present age than the contemporary boy of fifteen years of age who may even have only an average intelligence. The man of genius, thus come back from the past, would need to provide himself with an extraordinary, amount of preliminary information which our contemporary youth receives automatically, so to speak, during the time it is growing up among the products of our modern civilisation. Since the Jew—for reasons that I shall deal with immediately—never had a civilisation of his own, he has always been furnished by others with a basis for his intellectual work. His intellect has always been developed by the use of those cultural achievements which he has found ready to hand around him. The process has never been the reverse. Although among the Jews the instinct of self-preservation has not been weaker, but much stronger than among other peoples, and although the impression may easily be created that the intellectual powers of the Jew are at least equal to those of other races, the Jews completely lack the most essential prerequisite of a cultural people, namely, the idealistic spirit. With the Jewish people the spirit of self-sacrifice does not extend beyond the simple instinct of individual preservation. In their case, the feeling of racial solidarity which they apparently manifest, is nothing but a very primitive gregarious instinct, similar to that which may be found among other organisms in this world. It is a remarkable fact that this herd instinct brings individuals together for mutual protection, only as long as there is a common danger which makes mutual assistance expedient or inevitable.*  

- Page 327 (location ~ 5003-5020)    

*This is also true of horses, which unite to defend themselves against any aggressor, but separate the moment the danger is over. It is much the same with the Jew. His spirit of sacrifice is only apparent. It manifests itself only as long as the existence of the individual makes this a matter of absolute necessity, but as soon as the common foe is conquered, the danger which threatened the individual Jew overcome and the prey secured, then the apparent harmony disappears and the original conditions obtain again. Jews act in concord only when a common danger threatens them or a common prey attracts them. Where these two motives no longer exist, then the most brutal egotism appears and these people, who had previously lived together in unity, will turn into a swarm of rats that fight bitterly against each other. If the Jews were the only people in the world, they would be wallowing in filth and mire and would exploit one another and try to exterminate one another in a bitter struggle, except in so far as their utter lack of the ideal of sacrifice, which shows itself in their cowardly spirit, would prevent this struggle from developing. It would, therefore, be a complete mistake to interpret the mutual help, which the Jews render one another when they have to fight or, to put it more accurately, to exploit their fellow-beings, as the expression of a certain idealistic spirit of sacrifice. Here again, the Jew merely follows the call of his individual egotism. That is why the Jewish State, which ought to be a vital organisation to serve the purpose of preserving or increasing the race, has absolutely no territorial boundaries, for the territorial delimitation of a State always demands a certain idealism of spirit on the part of the race which forms that State, and especially a proper acceptance of the idea of work. A State which is territorially delimited cannot be established or maintained, unless the general attitude towards work is a positive one. If this attitude is lacking, then the necessary basis of a civilisation is also lacking. That is why the Jewish people, despite the intellectual powers with which they are apparently endowed, have not a culture, certainly not a culture of their own. The culture which the Jew enjoys to-day is the product of the work of others and this product is debased in the hands of the Jew. In order to form a correct judgment of the place which the Jew holds in relation to the whole problem of human civilisation, we must bear in mind the essential fact that there never has been any Jewish art, and consequently that nothing of this kind exists to-day. We must realise that, especially in the two royal domains of art, namely, architecture and music, the Jew has done no original creative work. When the Jew comes to producing something in the field of art he merely ‘borrows’ from something already in existence, or simply steals the intellectual work of others. The Jew essentially lacks the qualities which are characteristic of those creative races that are the founders of civilisation.*  

- Page 328 (location ~ 5022-5045)    

*At this juncture, the Jewish press comes in and renders friendly assistance by shouting hosannas over the head of even the most ordinary bungler of a Jew, until the rest of the world is persuaded into thinking that the object of so much praise must really be an artist, whereas in reality, he may be nothing more than a low-class mimic. The Jews have not the creative ability which is necessary for the founding of a civilisation, for in them there is not, and never hits been, that spirit of idealism which is an absolutely necessary element in the higher development of mankind. Therefore, the Jewish intellect will never be constructive, but always destructive. At best, it may serve as a stimulus in rare cases, but only in the limited meaning of the poet’s lines, “The Power which always wills the bad, and always works the good” ( Die stets Böse will und stets das Gute schafft.). It is not through him, but in spite of him, that mankind makes progress.*  

- Page 330 (location ~ 5050-5057)    

*We ought to remember that during the first period of American colonisation, numerous Aryans earned their daily livelihood as trappers, hunters, etc., frequently wandering about in large groups with their women and children, their mode of existence very much resembling that of ordinary nomads. The moment, however, that they grew more numerous and were able to accumulate larger resources, they cleared the land and drove out the aborigines, at the same time establishing settlements which rapidly increased all over the country. The Aryan himself was probably at first, a nomad and became a settler in the course of the ages, but yet he was never of the Jewish kind. The Jew is not a nomad, for the nomad has already a definite attitude towards the concept of ‘work,’ and this attitude served as the basis of a later cultural development when the necessary intellectual conditions existed. There is a certain amount of idealism in the general attitude of the nomad, even though it is rather primitive. His whole character may, therefore, be foreign to Aryan feeling, but it will never be repulsive. Not even the slightest trace of idealism exists, however, in the Jewish character. The Jew has never been a nomad, but always a parasite, battening on the substance of others. If he occasionally abandoned regions where he had hitherto lived, he did not do it voluntarily. He did it because, from time to time, he was driven out by people who were tired of having their hospitality, abused by such guests. Jewish self-expansion is a parasitic phenomenon, since the Jew is always looking for ‘pastures new’ for his race. But this has nothing to do with nomadic life as such, because the Jew does not ever think of leaving a territory which he has once occupied.*  

- Page 331 (location ~ 5067-5081)    

*He expands into new territories only when certain conditions for his existence are provided therein; but even then—unlike the nomad—he will not change his former abode. He is, and remains, a parasite, a sponger who, like a pernicious bacillus, spreads over wider and wider areas according as some favourable area attracts him. The effect produced by his presence is also like that of the vampire, for wherever he establishes himself the people who grant him hospitality are bound to be bled to death sooner or later. Thus the Jew has at all times lived in States that have belonged to other rags, and within the organisation of those States, he has formed a State of his own, which is, however, hidden behind the mask of a ‘religious community,’ as long as external circumstances do not make it advisable for this community to declare its true nature. As soon as the Jew feels himself sufficiently established in his position to be able to hold it without a disguise, he lifts the mask and suddenly appears in the character which so many did not formerly believe or wish to see, namely, that of the Jew. The life which the Jew lives as a parasite thriving on the substance of other nations and States has resulted in developing that specific character which Schopenhauer once described when he spoke of the Jew as ‘the great master of lies.’ The kind of existence which he leads, forces the Jew to the systematic use of falsehood, just as naturally as the inhabitants of northern climates are forced to wear warm clothes.*  

- Page 332 (location ~ 5082-5093)    

*He can live among other nations and States only as long as he succeeds in persuading them that the Jews are not a distinct people, but the representatives of a religious faith who thus constitute a ‘religious community,’ though this is of a peculiar character. As a matter of fact, however, this is the first of his great falsehoods. He is obliged to conceal his own particular character and mode of life, in order that he may be allowed to continue his existence as a parasite among the nations. The greater the intelligence of the individual Jew, the better will he succeed in deceiving others. His success in this line may even go so far that the people who grant him hospitality are led to believe that the Jew among them is a genuine Frenchman, for instance, or Englishman or German or Italian, who just happens to belong to a religious denomination which is different from that prevailing in these countries. Especially in circles concerned with the executive administration of the State, where the officials generally have only a minimum of historical sense, the Jew is able to impose his infamous deception with comparative ease. In these circles, independent thinking is considered a sin against the sacred rules according to which official promotion takes place. It is, therefore, not surprising that even to-day in the Bavarian government offices, for example, there is not the slightest suspicion that the Jews form a distinct nation in themselves and are not merely the adherents of a ‘confession,’ though one glance at the press which belongs to the Jews ought to furnish sufficient evidence to the contrary even for those who possess only the smallest degree of intelligence.*  

- Page 333 (location ~ 5093-5105)    

*In the Aryan mind no religion can ever be imagined unless it embodies the conviction that life in some form of other will continue after death. As a matter of fact, the Talmud is not a book that lays down principles according to which the individual should prepare for the life to come. It only furnishes rules for a practical and convenient life in this world. The religious teaching of the Jews is principally a collection of instructions for maintaining the Jewish blood pure and for regulating intercourse between Jew and Jew and between Jews and the rest of the world, that is to say non-Jews. The Jewish religious teaching is not concerned with moral problems. It is concerned rather with economic problems, and very petty ones at that. In regard to the moral value of the religious teaching of the Jews there exist, and always have existed, exhaustive studies (not from the Jewish side, for whatever the Jews have written on this question has naturally always been of a tendentious character), which show up the kind of religion that the Jews have in a light which makes it look very uncanny to the Aryan mind. The Jew himself is the best example of the kind of product which this religious training evolves. His life is of this world only and his mentality is as foreign to the true spirit of Christianity, as his character was foreign to the great Founder of the new creed two thousand years ago. The Founder of Christianity made no secret of His estimation of the Jewish people; when He found it necessary, He drove those enemies of the human race out of the Temple of God, because then, as always, they used religion as a means of advancing their commercial interests. At that time Christ was nailed to the Cross for his attitude towards the Jews, whereas our modern Christians enter into party politics, and when elections are being held they debase themselves to beg for Jewish votes. They even enter into political intrigues with the atheistic Jewish parties against the interests of their own Christian nation.*

*On this first and fundamental lie, the purpose of which is to make people believe that Jewry is not a people, but a religion, other lies are subsequently based. One of these further lies concerns, for example, the language spoken by the Jew. For him language is not an instrument for the expression of his inner thoughts, but rather a means of cloaking them. When talking French his thoughts are Jewish, and when writing German rhymes he only gives expression to the character of his own race. As long as the Jew has not succeeded in mastering other peoples, he is forced to speak their language whether he likes it or not, but the moment that the world became the slave of the Jew, it would have to learn some universal language (Esperanto, for example), so that by this means the Jew could dominate it the more easily. How much the whole existence of this people is based on a permanent falsehood is proved in a unique way by ‘The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,’ which are so violently repudiated by the Jews. With groans and moans, the Frankfurter Zeitung repeats again and again that these are forgeries. This alone is evidence in favour of their authenticity. What many Jews unconsciously wish to do is here clearly set forth. It is not necessary to ask out of what Jewish brain these revelations sprang, but what is of vital interest is that they disclose, with an almost terrifying precision, the mentality and methods of action characteristic of the Jewish people and these writings expound, in all their various aspects, the final aims towards which the Jews are striving.*

*A development then began which has always been the same or similar, wherever and whenever Jews came into contact with Aryan peoples. (a) As soon as the first permanent settlements had been established, the Jew was suddenly ‘there.’ He arrived as a merchant and, in the beginning, did not trouble to disguise his nationality. He still remained openly a Jew, partly it may be, because his appearance betrayed the racial difference between him and the people of the country in which he dwelt, or because he knew too little of the language. It may also be that people of other races refused to mix with him, so that he could not very well adopt any other pose than that of a foreign merchant. Because of his subtlety and cunning and the lack of experience on the part of the people whose guest he became, it was not to his disadvantage openly to retain his Jewish character. This may even have been advantageous to him, for the foreigner was received kindly. (b) Slowly but steadily, he began to take part in the economic life around him, not as a producer, however, but only as a middleman. His commercial cunning, acquired through thousands of years of negotiation as an intermediary, made him superior in this field to the Aryans, who were still quite ingenuous and indeed clumsy, and whose honesty was unlimited, so that after a short time commerce seemed destined to become, a Jewish monopoly. The Jew began by lending out money and, as usual, at a usurious rate of interest. It was he who first introduced the payment of interest on borrowed money. The danger which this innovation involved was not at first recognised; indeed, the innovation was welcomed, because it offered momentary advantages. (c) At this stage the Jew had become firmly settled; that is to say, he inhabited special sections of the cities and towns and had his own quarter in the market-towns. Thus he gradually came to form a State within the State. He came to look upon the commercial domain and all monetary transactions, as a privilege belonging exclusively to himself, and exploited it ruthlessly. (d) At this stage finance and trade had become his complete monopoly. Finally, his usurious rate of interest aroused opposition, and the increasing impudence which the Jew began to manifest all round stirred up popular indignation, while his display of wealth gave rise to popular envy.*

*In times of distress a wave of public anger has usually arisen against the Jew; the masses have taken the law into their own hands; they have seized Jewish property and ruined the Jew in their urge to protect themselves against what they consider to be a scourge of God. Having come to know the Jew intimately in the course of centuries, they looked upon his presence among them as a public danger comparable only to the plague. (e) Then the Jew began to reveal his true character. He paid court to governments, with servile flattery, used his money to ingratiate himself further and thus regularly secured for himself once again the privilege of exploiting his victims. Although public wrath flared up against this eternal profiteer and drove him out, after a few years he reappeared in those same place, and carried on as before. No persecution could force him to give up his trade of exploiting other people and no amount of harrying succeeded in driving him out permanently.*

No persecution could force him to give up his trade of exploiting other people and no amount of harrying succeeded in driving him out permanently. He always returned after a short time and it was always the old story with him. In an effort to prevent at least the worst from happening, laws were passed which debarred the Jew from obtaining possession of land. (f) In proportion as the powers of kings and princes increased, the Jew sidled up to them. He begged for ‘charters’ and ‘privileges’ which those gentlemen, who were generally in financial straits, gladly granted if they received adequate payment in return. However high the price he has to pay, the Jew will succeed in getting it back within a few years with interest and even with compound interest thanks to the privilege he has acquired. He is a real leech who clings to the body of his unfortunate victims and cannot be removed, so that when the princes found themselves in need once again they took the blood from his swollen veins with their own hands.*  

- Page 338 (location ~ 5176-5190)    

*The Jew calculated exactly the time when the downfall of the princes was approaching and did his best to hasten it. He intensified their financial difficulties by hindering them in the exercise of their duty towards their people, by encouraging them, through the most servile flattery, to indulge in vicious habits, whereby he made himself more and more indispensable to them. His astuteness, or rather, his utter unscrupulousness in money affairs enabled him to exact fresh payments from the princes subjects, to squeeze the money out of them and then have it spent as quickly as possible. Every Court had its ‘Court Jew,’ as this plague was called, who tortured the innocent victims until they were driven to despair, while at the same time he provided the means which the princes squandered on their own pleasures. It is not to be wondered at that these ornaments of the human race became the recipients of official honours and were even admitted to the ranks of the hereditary nobility, thus contributing not only to expose that social institution to ridicule, but also to contaminate it from the inside. Naturally, the Jew could now exploit the position which he had attained and advance even more rapidly than before. Finally, he only needed to be baptised in order to become entitled to all the rights and privileges which belonged to the children of the nation on which he preyed.*

*(h) At this stage a transformation began to take place in the world of Jewry. Up to now they had been Jews, that is to say, they had not hitherto set any great value on pretending to be something else, and anyhow, the distinctive characteristics which separated them from other races could not be easily overcome. Even as late as the time of Frederick the Great nobody looked upon the Jews as other than a ‘foreign’ people, and Goethe rose up in revolt against the failure legally to prohibit marriage between Christians and Jews. Goethe was certainly no reactionary and no timeserver; through him there spoke the voice of the blood and the voice of reason. Notwithstanding the disgraceful happenings taking place in Court circles, the people recognised instinctively that the Jew was the foreign body in their own flesh and their attitude towards him was dictated by recognition of that fact. But a change was now destined to take place. In the course of more than a thousand years the Jew had learned to master the language of his hosts so thoroughly that he considered he might now lay less stress on his Jewish character and emphasise his ‘Germanism’ more. Though it must have appeared ridiculous and absurd at first sight, he was impudent enough to call himself a ‘Teuton,’ which in this case, meant a German. In that way began one of the most infamous impositions that can be imagined. The Jew did not possess the slightest traces of the German character. He had only acquired the art of twisting the German language to his own uses, and that in a disgusting way, without having assimilated any other feature of the German character. Therefore, his command*

He had only acquired the art of twisting the German language to his own uses, and that in a disgusting way, without having assimilated any other feature of the German character. Therefore, his command of the language was the sole ground on which he could pretend to be a German. It is not, however, by the tie of language, but exclusively by the tie of blood that the members of a race are bound together, and the Jew himself knows this better than any other, seeing that he attaches so little importance to the preservation of his own language while at the same time he strives his utmost to keep his blood free from intermixture with that of other races.*  

- Page 340 (location ~ 5210-5226)    

*The reason why, at the stage I am dealing with, the Jew so suddenly decided to transform himself into a German is not difficult to discover. He felt the power of the princes slowly crumbling and therefore looked about to find a new social plank on which he might stand. Furthermore, his financial domination in all the spheres of economic life had become so great that he felt he could no longer sustain that enormous structure, or extend his influence, unless he were admitted to the full enjoyment of the ‘rights of citizenship.’ He aimed at both, preservation and expansion; for the higher he could climb, the more alluring became the prospect of reaching the old goal, which was promised to him in ancient times, namely world domination to which he now looked forward with feverish eyes, as he thought he saw it within his grasp.*  

- Page 342 (location ~ 5234-5240)    

*(i) Thus the Court Jew slowly developed into the democratic Jew, but naturally, he still remained associated with persons in higher quarters, and he even attempted to push his way further into the inner circles of the ruling set. At the same time some other representatives of his race were currying favour with the people. If we remember the crimes the Jew had committed against the masses of the people in the course of so many centuries, how repeatedly and ruthlessly he had exploited them and how he had sucked the very marrow of their substance, and when we further remember how they gradually came to hate him and finally considered him as public scourge then we can well understand how difficult the Jew must have found this final transformation; indeed, it must have taxed all his powers to be able to present himself as ‘the friend of humanity’ to the poor victims whom he had bled white. Therefore, the Jew began by making public amends for the crimes which he had committed against the people in the past. He started his metamorphosis by first appearing as the ‘benefactor’ of humanity. Since his new philanthropic policy had a very concrete aim in view, he could not very well apply to himself the biblical counsel, not to allow his left hand to know what his right hand was doing.*  

- Page 342 (location ~ 5241-5251)    

*Attention may be called to the fact that, in spite of his proclaimed readiness to make personal sacrifices, the Jew never becomes poor thereby. He has a happy knack of always making both ends meet. Occasionally, his benevolence might be compared to the manure which is not spread over the field merely out of kindness, but rather with a view to future produce. Anyhow, after a comparatively short period of time, the world was given to know that the Jew had become a general benefactor and philanthropist. What a unique transformation! What is looked upon as more or less natural when done by other people, here became an object of astonishment, and even sometimes of admiration, because it was considered so unusual in a Jew. That is why he has received more credit for his acts of benevolence than ordinary mortals. And something more! The Jew became liberal all of a sudden and began to talk enthusiastically of how human progress must be encouraged. Gradually he assumed the air of being the herald of a new age. Yet, at the same time, he continued to undermine the groundwork of that economic system which is of most benefit to the people. He bought up stock in the various national undertakings and thus pushed his influence into the circle of national production, making this latter an object of buying and selling on the Stock Exchange, or rather what might be called a pawn in a financial game of chess, thus ruining the only basis on which personal proprietorship is possible. Only with the entrance of the Jew did that feeling of estrangement between employers and employees begin which led at a later date to the political class-struggle. Finally, the Jew gained an increasing influence in all economic undertakings by means of his predominance on the Stock Exchange. He secured, if not the ownership, at least the control of the working capacity of the nation. In order to strengthen his political position, he directed his efforts towards removing the barrier of racial and civic discrimination which had hitherto hindered his advance at every turn. With characteristic tenacity he championed the cause of religious tolerance for this purpose, and in the Freemason organisation, which had fallen completely into his hands, he found a magnificent weapon which helped him to achieve his ends.*  

- Page 343 (location ~ 5257-5274)    

*The most important phase of his policy was therefore to secure control over the people. The Jew realised that in his efforts to reach the position of public despot he would need a ‘pacemaker,’ and he thought he could find a pacemaker if he could whip-in sufficiently large sections of the bourgeoisie, but the Freemasons failed to catch the glove-manufacturers and the linen-weavers in the frail meshes of their net, and so it became necessary to find a grosser and withal a more effective means. Thus another weapon beside that of freemasonry had to be secured. This was the press. The Jew exercised all his skill and tenacity in getting hold of it. By means of the press he began gradually to control public life in its entirety. He began to drive it along the road which he had chosen for the purpose of reaching his own ends, for he was now in a position to create and direct that force which, under the name of ‘public opinion’ is better known today than it was some decades ago. Simultaneously, the Jew gave himself the air of thirsting after knowledge. He lauded every phase of progress, particularly those phases which led to the ruin of others, for he judges all progress and development from the standpoint of the advantages which these bring to his own people. When it brings him no such advantages, he is the deadly enemy of enlightenment and hates all culture which is real culture as such. All the knowledge which he acquires in the schools of others is exploited by him exclusively in the service of his own race. He now guarded his Jewish ‘nationality’ more jealously than ever before. Though bubbling over with talk of ‘enlightenment,’ ‘progress,’ ‘liberty,’*

Though bubbling over with talk of ‘enlightenment,’ ‘progress,’ ‘liberty,’ ‘humanity,’ etc., his first care was to preserve the racial integrity of his own people. He occasionally bestowed one of his female offspring on an influential Christian, but the racial stock of his male descendants was always preserved unmixed on principle. He poisoned the blood of others, but preserved his own blood unadulterated.*  

- Page 345 (location ~ 5279-5294)    

*The comic papers presented the Jews as fundamentally goodhearted and honourable in spite of their manners, which might seem a bit strange. An attempt was generally made to make them appear insignificant, rather than dangerous. During this phase of his progress the chief goal of the Jew was the victory of democracy, or rather the supreme hegemony of the parliamentary system, which embodied his concept of democracy. This institution harmonised best with his purpose, for thus the personal element was eliminated and in its place we had the dunder-headed majority, inefficiency and, last but by no means least, cowardice. The final result must necessarily have been the overthrow of the monarchy, which had to come sooner or later. (j) A tremendous economic development transformed the social structure of the nation. As the small handicrafts gradually disappeared, the manual worker was robbed of the chance of earning his bread independently, and sank to the level of the proletariat. In his stead came the factory worker, whose essential characteristic is that he is seldom in a position to support himself independently in later life. In the true sense of the word, he is ‘disinherited.’ His old age is a misery to hint and can hardly be called a life at all.*  

- Page 346 (location ~ 5302-5312)    

*How far this Judaising process has been allowed to take effect among our people is illustrated by the fact that manual labour not only receives practically no recognition, but is even considered degrading. That is not a natural German attitude. It is due to the introduction of a foreign element into our lives, and that foreign element is the Jewish spirit, one of the effects of which has been to transform the high esteem in which our handicrafts were once held into a certain contempt for all manual labour. Thus a new social class has grown up which stands in low esteem, and the day must come when we shall have to face the question of whether the nation will be able to make this class an integral part of the social community, or whether the difference of status now existing will become a permanent gulf separating this class from the others. One thing, however, is certain, namely, that this class does not include the worst elements of the community in its ranks, on the contrary, it includes the most energetic elements of the nation. The sophistication which is the result of a socalled civilisation has not yet exercised its disintegrating and degenerating influence on this class. The broad masses of this new lower class, consisting of the manual labourers, have not yet fallen prey to the morbid weakness of pacifism. They are still robust and, if necessary, they can be brutal. While our bourgeois middle class paid no attention at all to this momentous problem and indifferently allowed events to take their course, the Jew realised the manifold possibilities which the situation offered him for the future. While, on the one hand, he organised capitalistic methods of exploitation to the highest possible degree, he curried favour with the victims of his policy and his power and in a short while became the leader of their struggle against himself. ‘Against himself’ is here only a figurative way of speaking; for this ‘great master of lies’ knows how to appear in the guise of the innocent and throw the guilt on others.*  

- Page 349 (location ~ 5338-5354)    

*In the open country there could be no social problem, because the master and the farm-hand were doing the same kind of work and doing it together. They ate their food in common, and sometimes even out of the same dish. But this, too, was altered. The division created between employer and employee seems now to have extended to all branches of life. How far this Judaising process has been allowed to take effect among our people is illustrated by the fact that manual labour not only receives practically no recognition, but is even considered degrading. That is not a natural German attitude. It is due to the introduction of a foreign element into our lives, and that foreign element is the Jewish spirit, one of the effects of which has been to transform the high esteem in which our handicrafts were once held into a certain contempt for all manual labour.

While, on the one hand, he organised capitalistic methods of exploitation to the highest possible degree, he curried favour with the victims of his policy and his power and in a short while became the leader of their struggle against himself. ‘Against himself’ is here only a figurative way of speaking; for this ‘great master of lies’ knows how to appear in the guise of the innocent and throw the guilt on others. Since he had the impudence to take a personal lead among the masses, they never for a moment suspected that they were falling a prey to one of the most infamous deceptions ever practised. Yet that is what it actually was. The moment this new class had arisen out of the general economic situation and taken shape as, a definite body in the social order, the Jew clearly saw where he would find the necessary pacemaker for his own progressive march.*  

- Page 348 (location ~ 5335-5357)    

*Outcries are systematically raised against international capital, but in reality it is against the national economic structure that these slogans are directed. The idea is to demolish this structure and on its ruins triumphantly erect the structure of the International Stock Exchange. The method of procedure of the Jew was as follows: He kowtowed to the worker, hypocritically pretended to feel pity for him and his lot, and even to be indignant at the misery and poverty which he had to endure. That is the way in which the Jew endeavoured to gain the confidence of the working class. He showed himself eager to study their various hardships, whether real or imaginary, and strove to awaken a yearning on the part of the workers to change the conditions under which they lived. The Jew artfully enkindled that innate yearning for social justice which is a typical Aryan characteristic. Once that yearning became alive, it was transformed into hatred against those in more fortunate circumstances of life. The next stage was to give a precise ideological aspect to the struggle for the elimination of social wrongs, and thus the Marxist doctrine was invented. By presenting this doctrine as part and parcel of a just vindication of social rights, the Jew propagated it all the more effectively, but at the same time he provoked the opposition of decent people who refused to admit these demands which, because of the form and pseudo-philosophical trimmings in which they were presented, seemed fundamentally unjust and unrealisable, for, under the cloak of purely social concepts there were hidden aims which were of a Satanic character. These aims are even openly expounded wish the clarity of unlimited impudence. This Marxist doctrine is an indivisible mixture of human reason and human absurdity, but the combination is arranged in such a way that only the absurd part of it could ever be put into practice, never the reasonable part.*  

- Page 350 (location ~ 5363-5377)    

*The very absurdity of the economic and political theories of Marxism gives the doctrine its peculiar significance. Because of, its pseudo-logic, intelligent people refuse to support it, while all those who are less accustomed to use their intellectual faculties, or who have only a rudimentary notion of economic principles, join the Marxist cause wholeheartedly. The intelligence behind the movement—for even this movement needs intelligence if it is to subsist—is supplied by the Jews themselves, as a ‘sacrifice’ on their part. Thus arose a movement which was composed exclusively of manual workers under the leadership of Jews. To all external appearances, this movement strives to ameliorate the conditions under which the workers live, but in reality its aim is to enslave and thereby annihilate the non-Jewish peoples. The propaganda which the Freemasons had carried on among the socalled intelligentsia, whereby their pacifist teaching paralysed the instinct for national self-preservation, was now extended to the broad masses of the workers and the bourgeoisie by means of the press, which was almost everywhere in Jewish hands.*  

- Page 351 (location ~ 5382-5391)    

*An attitude of sneaking servility towards ‘superiors’ and supercilious arrogance towards ‘inferiors’ are the characteristics of this class of people, as well as an appalling stupidity which is exceeded only by its amazing self-conceit. These qualities are of the greatest utility to the Jew in his dealings with our authorities and consequently he appreciates them. If I were to sketch roughly the actual struggle which is now beginning I should describe it somewhat thus: Not satisfied with the economic conquest of the world, but demanding that it must also come under his political control, the Jew subdivides the organised Marxist power into two parts, which correspond to the ultimate objectives that are to be fought for in this struggle which is carried on under his direction. To outward appearance, these seem to be two independent movements, but in reality they constitute an indivisible unity. The two divisions are the political movement and the tradeunion movement.*  

- Page 352 (location ~ 5397-5404)    

*The socalled national-minded bourgeoisie, blinded by its own material interests, opposes this life-and-death struggle of the workers and places the most difficult obstacles in their way. Not only does this bourgeoisie hinder all efforts to bring in legislation which would shorten the inhumanly long hours of work, prohibit child-labour, grant security and protection to women and improve the hygienic conditions in the workshops and the dwellings of the working class, but while it is engaged in so doing, the shrewd Jew takes the cause of the oppressed into his own hands. He gradually becomes the leader of the tradeunion movement, which is an easy task for him, because he does not genuinely intend to find remedies for the social wrong; he pursues only one objective, namely, to gather and consolidate a body of followers who will act under his command as an armed weapon in the economic war for the destruction of national economic independence. For, while a sound social policy has to aim at a double objective, that of securing a decent standard of public health and welfare on the one hand, and that of safeguarding the independence of the economic life of the nation, on the other, the Jew does not take these two aims into account at all. The destruction of both is one of his main objects. He would ruin, rather than safeguard, the independence of the national economic system.*  

- Page 353 (location ~ 5410-5420)    

*The Jews will, therefore, remain the unquestioned leaders of the tradeunion movement as long as no far-reaching campaign is undertaken for the enlightenment of the masses, in order that they may be better enabled to understand the causes of their misery. The same end might be achieved if the government authorities were to get rid of the Jew and his work, for as long as the masses remain as ill-informed as they actually are to-day, and as long as the State remains as indifferent to their lot as it now is, the masses will follow whatever leaders make them the most extravagant promises in regard to economic matters. The Jew is a past-master in this art and his activities are not hampered by moral considerations of any kind. Naturally, it takes him only a short time to defeat all his competitors in this field and drive them from the scene of action. In accordance with the general brutality and rapacity of his nature, he turns the tradeunion movement into an organisation for the exercise of physical violence. The resistance and antipathy of those whose insight has hitherto saved them from swallowing the Jewish bait, have been broken down by terrorism. The success of that kind of activity is enormous. Actually, the Jew is using the tradeunion, which could be a blessing to the nation, as a weapon with which to destroy the foundations of the national economic structure.*  

- Page 354 (location ~ 5428-5438)    

*The Jew’s instinct, which never fails where these problems have to be dealt with, readily discerns the true mentality of those whom he meets in everyday life and those who are not of a kindred spirit may be sure of being listed among his enemies. Since the Jew is not the object of aggression, but himself the aggressor, he considers as his enemies not only those who attack him, but also those who may be capable of resisting him. The means which he employs to break people of this kind who show themselves decent and upright, is no honourable conflict, but falsehood and calumny. He will stop at nothing. His utterly lowdown conduct is so appalling that one really cannot be surprised if, in the imagination of our people, Satan, as the incarnation of all evil, assumes the form and features of the Jew. The ignorance of the broad masses as regards the inner character of the Jew, and the lack of instinct and insight displayed by our upper classes, are among the reasons which explain how it is that so many people fall an easy prey to the systematic campaign of falsehood which the Jew carries on.*  

- Page 356 (location ~ 5454-5462)    

*(k) The domination of the Jew in the State seems now so fully assured that not only can he afford to call himself a Jew once again, but he even acknowledges freely and openly his ideas on racial and political questions. A section of the Jews avows itself quite openly as an alien people, but even here there is another falsehood. When the Zionists try to make the rest of the world believe that the new national consciousness of the Jews will be satisfied by the establishment of a Jewish State in Palestine, the Jews thereby adopt another means to dupe the simple-minded Aryan. They have not the slightest intention of building up a Jewish State in Palestine so as to live in it. What they are really aiming at is to establish a central organisation for their international swindling and cheating.*  

- Page 357 (location ~ 5468-5474)    

*The Jew uses every possible means to undermine the racial foundations of a people to be subjugated. In his systematic efforts to ruin girls and women, he strives to break down the last barriers of racial discrimination. The Jews were responsible for bringing Negroes into the Rhineland, with the ultimate idea of bastardizing the white race which they hate, and thus lowering its cultural and political level so that the Jew might dominate. As long as a people remains racially pure and race-conscious, it can never be overcome by the Jew. Never in this world can the Jew become master of any people except a bastardised people.*  

- Page 358 (location ~ 5481-5485)    

*Culturally, his activity consists in poisoning art, literature and the theatre, holding the expression of natural sentiment up to scorn, overturning all concepts of the sublime and beautiful, the worthy and the good, finally dragging the people down to the level of his own low mentality. Of religion he makes a mockery. Morality and decency are described as antiquated prejudices and thus a systematic attack is made for the purpose of undermining those last foundations on which the national being must rest if the nation is to struggle for its existence in this world.*  

- Page 359 (location ~ 5498-5502)    

*(l) Now begins the great and final revolution. As soon as the Jew is in possession of political power he drops all pretence. Out of the democratic Jew, the Jew of the people, arises the Jew lusting for blood, the tyrant of the peoples. In the course of a few years he endeavours to exterminate all those who represent the national intelligentsia, and by thus depriving the peoples of their natural intellectual leaders, he orepares them for their fate as slaves under a lasting despotism. Russia furnishes the most terrible example of such slavery. In that country the Jew killed or starved thirty millions of the people in a bout of savage fanaticism and resorted to the employment of inhuman torture.*  

- Page 359 (location ~ 5502-5507)    

*Every form of distress can give, a new impetus to human energy, and from oppression those forces can develop which bring about a re-birth of the national soul—provided always that the racial blood is kept pure. The loss of racial purity will wreck inner happiness for ever. It degrades men for all time to come, and the physical and moral consequences can never be wiped out. If this unique problem be studied and compared with the other problems of life we shall easily recognise how small is their importance in comparison with this. They are all limited in time, but the problem of the maintenance or loss of the purity of the racial blood will last as long as man himself exists. All the symptoms of decline which manifested themselves in pre-war times can be traced back to the racial problem. Whether one is dealing with questions of general law, of monstrous wrongs in economic life, of phenomena which point to a cultural decline or political degeneration whether it be a question of defects in the school-system or of the evil influence which the press exerts over the adult population in every case there phenomena are caused by a lack of consideration for the interests of the race to which one’s own nation belongs, or by failure to recognise the danger that comes from allowing a foreign race to exist within the national body. That is why all attempts at reform, all institutions for social relief, all political striving, all economic progress and all apparent increase in the general stock of knowledge, were doomed to be unproductive of any significant results. The nation, as well as the organisation which enables it to exist, namely, the State, were not developing in inner strength and stability but were, on the contrary, visibly losing their vitality.*

*The fact that millions of our people yearn for a radical change in our present conditions is proved by the profound discontent which exists among them. This feeling is manifested in a thousand ways. Some express it in their discouragement and despair; others show it in resentment, anger and indignation. In some this profound discontent calls forth an attitude of indifference, while it urges others to violent manifestations of wrath. Another indication of this feeling may be seen, on the one hand, in the attitude of those who abstain from voting at elections and, on the other, in the large numbers of those who side with the fanatical extremists of the left wing. It was to the latter that our young Movement had to appeal first of all. It was not to be an organisation for contented and satisfied people, but was meant to gather in all those who were suffering from profound anxiety and could find no peace, those who were unhappy and discontented. It was not meant to float on the surface of national life, but rather to push its roots deep down among the people.*  

- Page 364 (location ~ 5572-5580)    

*On the surface, these intellectual classes appeared to be national-minded, but that word meant nothing to them except a very vague and feeble concept of the duty to defend what they called the interests of the State, which in turn seemed identical with those of the dynastic regime. This class tried to defend its ideas and realise its aims by carrying on the fight with the aid of intellectual weapons, which, insufficient and superficial enough in the face of the brutal methods adopted by the adversary, were, of their very nature, bound to fail. With one violent blow the class which had hitherto governed was now struck down; it trembled with fear and accepted every humiliation imposed on it by the merciless victor. Over against this class stood the broad masses of manual labourers who were organised in movements with a more or less radically Marxist tendency. These organised masses were firmly determined to break any kind of intellectual resistance by the use of brute force. They had no nationalist tendencies whatsoever and deliberately repudiated the idea of advancing the interests of the nation as such. On the contrary, they promoted the interests of the foreign oppression. Numerically, this class embraced the majority of the population and, what is more important, included all those elements of the nation without whose collaboration a national resurgence was not only a practical impossibility, but was even inconceivable.*  

- Page 365 (location ~ 5582-5593)    

*Even in 1918 one thing had to be clearly recognised, namely, that no resurgence of the German nation could take place until we had first re-established our national strength in relation to the outside world. For this purpose arms were not the preliminary necessity, though our bourgeois ‘statesmen’ always blathered about it being so; what was wanted was will-power. At one time the German people had more than sufficient armaments, and yet that did not suffice for the defence of its liberty, because it lacked that energy which springs from the instinct of national self-preservation and the will to hold one’s own. The best armament is only dead and worthless material as long as the spirit is wanting which makes men willing and determined to avail themselves of such weapons. Germany was rendered defenceless, not because she lacked arms, but because she lacked the will to keep her arms for the further preservation of her people. To-day our left-wing politicians, in particular, are constantly insisting that their craven-hearted and obsequious, but in reality treacherous, foreign policy necessarily results from the disarmament of Germany. To all that kind of talk the answer ought to be, ‘No, the contrary is the truth. Your action in delivering up the arms was dictated by your antinational and criminal policy of abandoning the interests of the nation. Now you try to make people believe that your miserable whining is fundamentally due to the fact that you have no arms. Just like everything else in your conduct, this is a lie and a falsification of the true facts.’*  

- Page 365 (location ~ 5594-5605)    

*The conservative politicians have neither right nor reason on their side when they cite disarmament as the cause which compelled them to adopt a policy of prudence (that is to say, of cowardice). The truth is that disarmament is the result of their pusillanimity. Therefore, the problem of restoring Germany’s power is not a question of how we can manufacture arms, but rather a question of how we can foster that spirit which enables a people to bear arms. Once this spirit prevails among a people, then it will find a thousand ways, each of which leads to the acquisition of arms. A coward will not fire even a single shot when attacked, though he may be armed with ten pistols; to him they are of less value than a blackthorn in the hands of a man of courage. The problem of re-establishing the political power of our nation is first of all a problem of restoring the instinct of national self-preservation, if for no other reason than that every preparatory step in foreign policy and every weighing up by foreign Powers of the military value of a State has been proved by experience to be grounded not on the total amount of armaments such a State may possess, but rather on the moral capacity for resistance which such a State has, or is believed to have.*  

- Page 366 (location ~ 5607-5616)    

*The British nation will, therefore, be considered as the most valuable ally in the world as long as it can be counted upon to show that brutality and tenacity in its government, as well as in the spirit of the broad masses, which enables it to carry on till victory any struggle upon which it once enters, no matter how long such a struggle pray last, no matter how great the sacrifice that may be necessary and no matter what the means that have to be employed—and all this even though the actual military equipment at hand may be utterly inadequate as compared with that of other nations. Once it is understood that the restoration of Germany is a question of reawakening the will to political self-preservation we shall see quite clearly that it will not be enough to win over those elements that are already national-minded, but that the deliberately antinational masses must be converted to believe in the national ideals. A young movement that aims at re-establishing a German State with full sovereign powers will therefore have to make the task of winning over the broad masses a special objective of its plan of campaign.*  

- Page 367 (location ~ 5619-5627)    

*Our nation which has to exist disarmed under tie thousand eyes appointed by the Versailles Peace Treaty, cannot make any technical preparations for the recovery of its freedom and human independence, until the whole army of spies employed within the country is cut down to those few whose inborn baseness would lead them to betray anything and everything for the proverbial thirty pieces of silver. We can deal with such people, but the millions, who are opposed to the national revival, simply because of their political opinions, constitute an insurmountable obstacle. At least, the obstacle will remain insurmountable, as long as the cause of their opposition, which is international Marxism, is not overcome and its teachings banished from both their hearts and minds. From whatever point of view we may examine the possibility of recovering our independence as a State and as a nation, whether we consider the problem from the standpoint of technical rearmament or from that of the actual struggle itself, the necessary prerequisite always remains the same.*  

- Page 369 (location ~ 5656-5664)    

*As early as 1919 we were convinced that to make the masses national-minded would have to constitute the first and paramount aim of the new movement. From the tactical standpoint, this decision brought with it a certain number of obligations. (1) No social sacrifice could be considered too great in this effort to win over the masses for the national revival. Whatever economic concessions are granted to-day to employees are negligible when compared with the benefit to be reaped by the whole nation if such concessions contribute to bring back the masses of the people once more to an appreciation of their own nationality. Nothing but meanness and short-sightedness, which are characteristics that are unfortunately only too prevalent among our employers, could prevent people from recognising that in the long run no economic improvement and therefore no rise, in profits are possible unless the internal völkisch solidarity of our nation be restored.*  

- Page 370 (location ~ 5673-5680)    

*(2) The education of the masses along national lines can be carried out only indirectly, by improving social conditions, for only by such a process can the economic conditions be created which enable everybody to share in the cultural life of the nation. (3) The making of the broad masses national-minded can never be achieved by half-measures—that is to say, by feebly insisting on what is called the objective side of the question—but only by a ruthless and fanatically onesided insistence on the aim which must be achieved.*

*(2) The education of the masses along national lines can be carried out only indirectly, by improving social conditions, for only by such a process can the economic conditions be created which enable everybody to share in the cultural life of the nation. (3) The making of the broad masses national-minded can never be achieved by half-measures—that is to say, by feebly insisting on what is called the objective side of the question—but only by a ruthless and fanatically onesided insistence on the aim which must be achieved. This means that a people cannot be made ‘national’ in the sense of that word as accepted by our bourgeois class to-day—that is to say, nationalism with many reservations—but ‘national’ in the vehement and extreme sense. Poison can be overcome only by a counter-poison and only the supine bourgeois mind could think that the Kingdom of Heaven can be attained by a compromise. The broad masses of a nation are not made up of professors and diplomats. Since these masses have but little acquaintance with abstract ideas, their reactions lie more in the domain of the feelings, which determine their positive or their negative attitude as the case may be.*  

- Page 371 (location ~ 5688-5697)    

*(4) The soul of the masses can be won only if those who lead the movement are determined not merely to carry through the positive struggle for their own aims, but are also determined to destroy the enemy that opposes them.*  

- Page 373 (location ~ 5705-5706)    

*The emotional grounds of their attitude furnish the reason for their extraordinary stability. It is always more difficult to fight successfully against faith than against knowledge. Love is less subject to change than respect. Hatred is more lasting than mere aversion. None of the tremendous revolutions which this world has witnessed, have been brought about by a scientific revelation, which has moved the masses, but always by an ardour which has inspired them, and often by a kind of hysteria which has urged them to action. Whoever wishes to win over the masses must find the key that will open the door to their hearts. It is not objectivity, which is weakness, but determination and strength.*  

- Page 372 (location ~ 5699-5705)    

*(4) The soul of the masses can be won only if those who lead the movement are determined not merely to carry through the positive struggle for their own aims, but are also determined to destroy the enemy that opposes them. When they see an uncompromising onslaught against an adversary, the people have at all times taken this as a proof that right is on the side of the aggressor. But if the aggressor should go only half-way and fail to push home his success by driving his opponent entirely from the scene of action, the people will look upon this as a sign that the aggressor is uncertain of the justice of his own cause and, that his half-way policy may even be an acknowledgment that his cause is unjust. The masses are but a part of Nature herself. Their feeling is such that they cannot understand mutual handshakings between men who are declared enemies.*  

- Page 373 (location ~ 5705-5711)    

*(5) All the great problems of our time are problems of the moment and are only the results of certain definite causes, and among all these there is only one that has a profoundly causal significance. This is the problem of preserving the pure racial stock among the people. Human vigour or decline depends on the blood. Nations that are not aware of the importance of their racial stock, or which neglect to preserve it, are like men who would try to educate the pug-dog to do the work of the greyhound, not understanding that neither the speed of the greyhound nor the imitative faculties of the poodle are inborn qualities which cannot be drilled into the one or the other by any form of training. A people that fails to preserve the purity of its racial blood thereby destroys the unity of the soul of the nation in all its manifestations. A disintegrated national character is the inevitable consequence of a process of disintegration in the blood, and the change which takes place in the spiritual and creative faculties of a people is only an outcome of the change that has modified its racial substance. If we are to free the German people from all those non-characteristic failings and traits we must first get rid of alien causes of these traits and failings. The German nation will never revive unless the racial problem, and with it, the Jewish question, is taken into account and dealt with. The racial problem furnishes the key, not only to the understanding of human history, but also to the understanding of every kind of human culture. (6) By incorporating in the national community the broad masses of our people (who are now in the international camp) we do not mean to renounce the principle that the interests of the various trades and professions must be safeguarded.*  

- Page 373 (location ~ 5714-5727)    

*Finally, it is not part of our programme to transform the nationalist camp itself, but, rather to win over those who are antinational in their outlook. It is this point of view which must finally determine the tactics of the whole movement. (7) This onesided, but, consequently, clear and definite attitude must be manifested in the propaganda of the movement; and, on the other hand, this clarity is absolutely necessary in order to make the propaganda itself effective. If propaganda is to be of service to the movement it must be addressed to one side alone; for if it should vary the direction of its appeal it will not be understood in the one camp and may be rejected by the other as obvious and uninteresting, for the intellectual background of the two camps that come into question is very different. Even the manner in which something is presented and the tone in which particular details are emphasised cannot have the same effect on those two strata that belong respectively to the opposite extremes of the social structure. If the propaganda should refrain from using primitive forms of expression, it will not appeal to the sentiment of the masses.*  

- Page 377 (location ~ 5771-5780)    

*Among a hundred men who call themselves orators, there are scarcely ten who are capable of speaking with effect to an audience of street-sweepers, mechanics, navvies, etc., to-day and of expounding the same subject with equal effect tomorrow to an audience of university professors and students. Among a thousand public speakers there may be only one who can address a mixed audience of mechanics and professors in the same hall in such a way that his statements can be fully comprehended by each group while, at the same time, he effectively influences both to such an extent that they are carried away by a common enthusiasm. It must always be remembered that in most cases even the most beautiful idea embodied in a sublime theory can be brought home to the public only by men of middling ability. The thing that matters here is not the vision of the man of genius who created the great ideal, but rather what his apostles tell the broad masses, how they do this and with what degree of success. Social Democracy and the whole Marxist movement were particularly qualified to attract the great masses of the nation, because of the uniformity of the public to which they addressed their appeal. The more limited and narrow their ideas and arguments, the easier it was for the masses to grasp and assimilate them, for those ideas and arguments were well adapted to a low level of intelligence.*  

- Page 378 (location ~ 5782-5792)    

*At a public meeting where the great masses are gathered together the best speaker is not he whose way of approaching a subject is most akin to the spirit of those intellectuals who may happen to be present, but the speaker who knows how to win the hearts of the masses. An educated man who is present and who finds fault with an address because he considers it to be on an intellectual plane that is too low, though he himself has witnessed its effect on the lower intellectual groups whose adherence has to be won, only shows himself completely incapable of rightly judging the situation and thereby proves that he can be of no use in the new movement. Only those intellectuals can be of use to a movement who understand its mission and its aims so well that they have learned to judge the methods of propaganda exclusively by the success obtained and never by the impression which those methods, make on them personally. Propaganda is not meant to serve as an entertainment for those people who already have a nationalist outlook; its purpose is to win the adhesion of those who have hitherto been hostile to the nation, but who are, nevertheless, of our own blood and race.*  

- Page 378 (location ~ 5794-5803)    

*(8) The ends which any political reform movement sets out to attain can never be reached by trying to educate the public or influence those in power, but only by getting political power into its hands. It is not only the right, but the duty, of the protagonists of any world- shattering ideal to secure control of such means as will enable them to realise that idea. In this world, success is the standard whereby we can decide whether such an undertaking was right or wrong, and by the word ‘success’ in this connection I do not mean such a success as the mere acquisition of power in 1918, but the beneficial results of such an acquisition of power. A coup d’etat cannot, therefore, he considered successful if, as many empty-headed critics in Germany now, believe, the revolutionaries succeeded in seizing control of the State, but only if, in comparison with the state of affairs under the old regime, the lot of the nation has been improved when the aims and intentions on which the revolution was based have been put into practice.*  

- Page 379 (location ~ 5806-5814)    

*each case the president is appointed from above and is invested with full authority and executive power. Only the leader of the whole party is elected, at the general meeting of the members, but he is the sole leader of the movement. All the committees are responsible to him, but he is not responsible to the committees. His decision is final, but he bears the whole responsibility for it. The members of the movement are entitled to call him to account by means of a new election, or to remove him from office, if he has violated the principles of the movement or has not served its interests adequately. He is then replaced by a more capable man, who is invested with the same authority and obliged to bear the same responsibility. One of the highest duties of the movement is to make this principle valid not only within its own ranks, but also for the whole State. The man who becomes leader is invested with supreme and unlimited authority, but he also has to bear the final and heaviest responsibility. The man who has not the courage to shoulder responsibility for his actions is not fitted to be a leader. Only a man of heroic mould can have the vocation for such a task. Human progress and human culture are not founded by the multitude. They are exclusively the work of personal genius and personal efficiency.*  

- Page 380 (location ~ 5827-5837)    

*Because of this principle, the movement must necessarily be anti-parliamentarian: and if it takes part in a parliamentary institution it must be only for the purpose of destroying this institution from within; in other words, we wish to do away with an institution which we must look upon as one of the gravest symptoms of human decline. (10) The movement steadfastly refuses to take up any stand in regard to problems which are either outside of its sphere of political work or seem to have no fundamental importance for it. It does not aim at bringing about a religious reformation, but rather a political reorganisation of our people. It looks upon the two religious denominations as equally valuable mainstays for the existence of our people, and therefore it makes war on all those parties which would degrade the foundation on which the religious and moral stability of our people is based, by exploiting it in the service of party interests. Finally, the movement does not aim at re-establishing any one form of State or trying to destroy another, but rather at making those fundamental principles prevail without which no republic and no monarchy can exist for any length of time. The movement does not consider its mission to be the establishment of a monarchy or the preservation of the Republic but rather the creation of a Germanic State.*  

- Page 381 (location ~ 5838-5848)    

*The most valuable association of qualities is a combination of talent, determination and perseverance. (12) The future of a movement is determined by the devotion, and even intolerance, with which its members fight for their cause. They must feel convinced that their cause alone is just, and they must carry it through to success, as against other similar organisations in the same field. It is quite erroneous to believe that the strength of a movement must increase if it is to be combined with other movements of a similar kind.*  

- Page 386 (location ~ 5916-5920)    

*A movement can become great only if the unhampered development of its internal strength be safeguarded and steadfastly augmented, until victory over all rivals is secured. One may safely say that the strength of a movement and its right to existence can be developed only as long as it remains true to the principle that struggle is a necessary condition of its progress and that it has exceeded the maximum limit of its strength at that moment in which complete victory, is within its grasp. Therefore, a movement must not strive to obtain successes that will be only immediate and transitory, but it must show a spirit of uncompromising perseverance in carrying on a long struggle which will secure for it a long period of inner growth. All those movements which owe their expansion to a socalled combination of similar organisms, which means that their external strength is due to a policy of compromise, are like plants whose growth is forced in a hothouse.*  

- Page 387 (location ~ 5929-5936)    

*The greatness of every powerful organisation which embodies a creative ideal lies in the spirit of religious devotion and intolerance with which it stands out against all others, because it has an ardent faith in its own cause. If an ideal is right in itself and, furnished with the fighting weapons I have mentioned, wages war on this earth, then it is invincible and persecution will only add to its internal strength. The greatness of Christianity did not arise from attempts to make compromises with those philosophical opinions of the ancient world which had some resemblance to its own doctrine, but in the unrelenting and fanatical proclamation and defence of its own teaching. The apparent advance that a movement makes by associating itself with other movements will be easily reached and surpassed by the steady increase of strength which a doctrine and its organisation acquires if it remains independent and fights its own cause alone.*  

- Page 388 (location ~ 5938-5945)    

*(13) The movement ought to educate its adherents on the principle that struggle must not be considered a necessary evil, but as something desirable in itself. Therefore, they must not be afraid of the hostility which their adversaries manifest towards them, but they must take it as a necessary condition on which their own right to existence is based.*  

- Page 388 (location ~ 5945-5947)    

*The followers of the Movement, and indeed the whole nation, must be reminded again and again of the fact that, through the medium of his newspapers, the Jew is always spreading falsehood. If he tells the truth on certain occasions, it is only for the purpose of masking some greater deception, which turns the apparent truth into a deliberate falsehood. The Jew is past master in the art of lying. Falsehood and duplicity are the weapons with which he fights. Every calumny and falsehood published by the Jews are honourable scars borne by our comrades. He whom they decry most is nearest to our hearts and he whom they mortally hate is our best friend. If a comrade of ours opens a Jewish newspaper in the morning and does not find himself vilified there, then he has wasted the previous day, for, if he had achieved something, he would be persecuted, slandered, derided, and abused.*  

- Page 389 (location ~ 5952-5958)    

*(14) The Movement must use every possible means to cultivate respect for the individual personality. It must never forget that all human values are based on personal values, and that every idea and achievement is the fruit of the creative power of one man. We must never forget that admiration for everything that is great, is not only a tribute to one creative personality, but that all those who feel such admiration become thereby united under one covenant.*  

- Page 389 (location ~ 5962-5965)    

*The Jew tries to belittle the respect in which nations hold their own great men and women. He stigmatises this respect as ‘the cult of personality.’ As soon as a nation has so far lost its courage as to submit to this impudent defamation on the part of the Jew, it renounces the most important source of its own inner strength. This inner force cannot arise from a policy of pandering to the masses, but only from the worship of men of genius, with its uplifting and ennobling influence, to any of our speakers. Consider that only six or seven poor devils who were entirely unknown came together to found a movement which should succeed in doing what the great mass-parties had failed to do, namely, to reconstruct a German Reich, having even greater power and glory than before.*  

- Page 390 (location ~ 5974-5979)    

*Every Wednesday, what was called a committee meeting was held in one of the cafés, and a debate was arranged for one evening each week. In the beginning, all the members, of the ‘movement’ were also members of the committee; therefore the same persons always turned up at both meetings. The first step that had to be taken was to extend the narrow limits of this small circle and get new members, but, above all, it was necessary to utilise all the means at our command for the purpose of making the movement known. We chose the following methods. We attempted to hold a ‘meeting’ every month, and later, every fortnight. Some of the invitations were typewritten, and some were written by hand. For the first few meetings we distributed them in the streets and delivered them personally at certain houses. Each one canvassed among his own acquaintances and tried to persuade some of them to attend our meetings. The result was lamentable. I still remember how I personally once delivered eighty of these invitations and how we waited in the evening for the crowds to come. After waiting in vain for a whole hour the ‘chairman’ finally had to open the ‘meeting.’ Again there were only seven persons present, the old familiar seven. We then changed our methods. We had the invitations typewritten and multi-graphed at a Munich stationer’s shop. The result was that a few more people attended our next meeting. The number increased, gradually from eleven to, thirteen, to seventeen, to twenty-three and finally to thirty-four. We collected some money within our own circle, each poor soul giving a small contribution, and in that way we raised sufficient funds to be able to advertise one of our meetings in the Münchener Beobachter, which was then an independent paper.*  

- Page 391 (location ~ 5990-6004)    

*At seven o’clock one hundred and eleven persons were present, and the meeting was opened. A Munich professor delivered the principal address, and I spoke after him. That was my first appearance in the role of public orator. The whole thing seemed a very daring adventure to Herr Harrer, who was then chairman of the Party. He was a very decent fellow, but he had an a priori conviction that, though I might have, quite a number of good qualities, I certainly did not have a talent for public speaking. Even later he could not be persuaded to change his opinion. Things turned out differently. Twenty minutes had been allotted to me for my speech on this occasion, which might be looked upon as our first public meeting. I spoke for thirty minutes, and what I always had felt deep down in my heart, without being able to put it to the test, was here proved to be true; I could make a good speech. At the end of the thirty minutes, it, was quite clear that all the people in the little hall had been profoundly impressed. The enthusiasm aroused among them found its first expression in the fact that my appeal to those present brought us donations which amounted to three hundred marks. That was a great relief to us. Our finances were at that time so meagre that we could not afford to have our party programme, or even leaflets, printed. Now we possessed at least the nucleus of a fund from which we could meet the most urgent and necessary expenses. The success of this first larger meeting was also important from another point of view. I had already begun to introduce some young and fresh members into the committee.*  

- Page 392 (location ~ 6007-6019)    

*The most effective means which they always employed in such cases were terrorism and brute force. The Marxist leaders, whose business consisted in deceiving and misleading the public, naturally hated most of all a movement whose declared aim was to win over those masses which had hitherto been exclusively at the service of international Marxism in the Jewish and Stock Exchange parties. The mere title, ‘German Labour Party,’ irritated them. It could easily be foreseen that at the first opportune moment we should have to face the opposition of the Marxist despots who were still intoxicated with their triumph in 1918. People in the small circle of our own Movement at that time showed a certain amount of anxiety at the prospect of such a conflict.*  

- Page 395 (location ~ 6043-6049)    

*Terrorism cannot be overcome by the weapons of the mind, but only by counter-terror. The success of our first public meeting strengthened my own position. The members felt encouraged to arrange for a second meeting on a somewhat larger scale. Some time in October 1919 the second larger meeting took place in the Eberlbräukeller . The theme of our speeches was ‘Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.’ There were four speakers. I spoke for almost an hour, and my success was even more striking than at our first meeting. The number of people who attended had increased to over one hundred and thirty. An attempt to disturb the proceedings was immediately frustrated by my comrades. The would-be disturbers were thrown down the stairs, with bruised heads. A fortnight later, another meeting took place in the same hall. The number in attendance had now increased to more than one hundred and seventy, which meant that the room was fairly well filled. I spoke again, and once more the success obtained was greater than at the previous meeting. Then I proposed that a larger hall should be found. After looking around for some time we discovered one at the other end of the town, in the Deutsches Reich in the Dachauer Strasse.*

*Any person who tries to carry into practice an original idea whose realisation would be for the benefit of his fellow men will first have to look for disciples who are ready to fight for the ends he has in view. Even if these aims were merely to destroy the existing party system, and thereby to put a stop to the process of disintegration, then all those who come forward as protagonists and apostles of such an ideal are a party in themselves as long as their final goal is not reached. It is only hair-splitting and playing with words if these antiquated völkisch theorists, whose practical success is in inverse ratio to their wisdom, presume to think they can change the character of a movement, which is at the same time a party, by merely changing its name. If there is anything which is non- völkisch it is this messing about with old Germanic expressions, in particular, which neither suit the present time nor conjure up a definite picture. This habit of borrowing words from the dead past tends to mislead the people into thinking that the external trappings of its vocabulary are the important feature of a movement.*  

- Page 397 (location ~ 6082-6090)    

*These are definite grounds that make it absolutely necessary for the movement to be dominated by a strong central force which is embodied in the authoritative leadership. In this way alone is it possible to counteract the activity of such fatal elements, and that is just the reason why these völkisch Ahasueruses are vigorously hostile to any movement whose members are firmly united under one leader and one discipline. Those people of whom I have, spoken hate such a movement because it is capable of putting a stop to their mischief. It was not without good reason that when we laid down a clearly defined programme for the new movement we excluded the word völkisch from it. The concept underlying the term völkisch cannot serve as the basis of a movement, because it is too indefinite and general in its application. Therefore, if somebody calls himself völkisch this cannot be taken as a sign of party membership. Because this concept is practically indefinable it gives rise to various interpretations and thus people can use it all the more easily as a sort of personal recommendation. Whenever such a vague concept, which is subject to so many interpretations, is admitted into a political movement it tends to break up the disciplined solidarity of the fighting forces.*

*A well-known professor in Bavaria, a famous combatant who fights only with the weapons of the mind and who boasts of having laid siege to Berlin (with the weapons of the mind, of course), believes that the word völkisch is synonymous with ‘monarchical.’ But this learned authority has hitherto neglected to explain how our German monarchs of the past can be identified with what we generally mean by the word völkisch to-day. I am afraid he will find himself at a loss, if he is asked to give a precise answer, for it would be very difficult indeed to imagine anything less völkisch than were most of those German monarchical states. Had they been otherwise they would not have disappeared; or if they were völkisch, then the fact of their downfall world have to be taken as evidence that the völkisch Weltanschauung is false. Everybody interprets this concept in his own way, but such multifarious opinions cannot be adopted as the basis of a militant political movement. I need not call attention to the absolute lack of worldly wisdom, and especially failure to understand the soul of the nation, which is displayed by these völkisch John-the-Baptists of the twentieth century. Sufficient attention has been called to these people by the ridicule which the left-wing parties have heaped on them. They allow them to babble on and sneer at them. I do not set much value on the friendship of people who do not succeed in getting themselves disliked by their enemies. Therefore, we considered the friendship of such people as not only worthless, but even dangerous to our young Movement.*

I do not set much value on the friendship of people who do not succeed in getting themselves disliked by their enemies. Therefore, we considered the friendship of such people as not only worthless, but even dangerous to our young Movement. That was the principal reason why we first called ourselves a Party. We hoped that by giving ourselves such a name we might scare away a whole host of völkisch dreamers, and that was also the reason why we named our Party, The National Socialist German Labour Party. The first term, Party, kept away all those dreamers who live in the past and all lovers of bombastic nomenclature, as well as those who went around beating the big drum for the völkisch idea. The full name of the Party kept away all those heroes whose weapon is the sword of the spirit and all those whining poltroons who take refuge behind their socalled ‘intelligence’, as if it were a kind of shield. It was only to be expected that this latter class would launch a massed attack against us after our Movement had started; but, of course, it was only a pen-and-ink attack, for the goosequill is the only weapon which these völkisch heroes wield. We had declared one of our principles thus, “We shall meet violence with violence in our own defence.” Naturally, that principle disturbed the equanimity of the knights of the pen. They reproached us bitterly not only for what they called our crude worship of the cudgel, but also because, according to them, we had no intellectual forces on our side.*

*These charlatans did not think for a moment that a Demosthenes could be reduced to silence at a mass meeting by fifty idiots who had come there to shout him down and use their fists against his supporters. The innate cowardice of the pen-and-ink charlatan prevents him from exposing himself to such a danger, for he always works in ‘peace and quiet’ and never dares to make a noise or come forward in public. Even to-day I must warn the members of our young Movement in the strongest possible terms to guard against the danger of falling into the snare of those who claim to work in ‘peace and quiet,’ for they are not only a white-livered lot, but are also and always will be ignorant do-nothings. A man who is aware of certain happenings and knows that a certain danger threatens, and at the same time sees a certain remedy which can be employed against it, is in duty bound not to work in ‘peace and quiet,’ but to come into the open and publicly fight for the destruction of the evil and the acceptance of his own remedy. If he does not do so, then he is neglecting his duty and shows that he is weak in character and that he fails to act either because of his timidity, his indolence or his incompetence.*

Most of those who work in ‘peace and quiet,’ generally pretend to know God knows what. Not one of them is capable of any real achievement, but they keep on trying to fool the world with their antics. Though quite indolent, they try to create the impression that their peaceful, quiet work keeps them very busy. To put it briefly, they are sheer swindlers, political jobbers who feel chagrined by the honest work which others are doing. When you find one of these völkisch moths talking of the value of ‘peace and quiet,’ you may be sure that you are dealing with a fellow who does no productive work at all, but steals from others the fruits of their honest labour. In addition to all this one ought to note the arrogance and conceited impudence with which these obscurantist idlers try to tear to pieces the work of other people, criticising it with an air of superiority, and thus playing into the hands of the mortal enemy of our people. Even the simplest follower who has the courage to stand on the table in some beer-hall where his enemies are gathered, and manfully and openly defend his position against them, achieves a thousand times more than these slinking hypocrites.*

*At the beginning of 1920 I put forward the idea of holding our first mass meeting. On this proposal there were differences of opinion amongst us. Some leading members of our Party thought that the time was not ripe for such a meeting and that the result might be detrimental. The press of the Left had begun to take notice of us and we were lucky enough to be able gradually to arouse their wrath. We had begun to appear at other meetings and to ask questions or contradict the speakers, with the natural result, that we were shouted down forthwith, but still we thereby gained something. People began to know of our existence and the better they understood us, the stronger became their aversion and their enmity. Therefore we might expect that a large contingent of our ‘friends’ from the Red camp would attend our first mass meeting. I fully realised that there was a great probability that our meeting would be broken up, but we had to face the fight, if not now, then some months later. It was up to us from the very first to immortalise the Movement by defending it in a spirit of blind faith and ruthless determination.*  

- Page 404 (location ~ 6180-6189)    

*For our principal colour we chose red, as it has an exciting effect on the eye and was calculated to arouse the attention of our opponents and irritate them. Thus they would have to take notice of us whether they liked it or not and would not forget us. During the period which followed, the close bond of union between the Marxists and the Centre party (in Bavaria as elsewhere) was clearly revealed by the strenuous efforts made by the Bavarian People’s Party, which was omnipotent here to counteract the effect which our placards were having on the ‘Red’ masses. If the police could find no other grounds for prohibiting the display of our placards, then they might claim that we were disturbing the traffic in the streets. Thus the socalled German National People’s Party calmed the anxieties of their ‘Red’ allies by completely prohibiting those placards which proclaimed a message that was bringing back hundreds of thousands of workers who had been misled by international agitators and worked up against their own nation to the bosom of their own people. These placards bear witness to the bitterness of the struggle in which the young Movement was then engaged. Future generations will find in these placards documentary evidence of our determination and the justice of our own cause. They will also prove how the socalled national officials took arbitrary action to strangle a movement that did not please them, because it was making the broad masses of the people national-minded and winning them back to their own racial stock.*

*When the last point was reached I had before me a hall full of people united by a new conviction, a new faith and a new resolve. Nearly four hours had passed, when the hall began to clear. As the masses streamed towards the exits, crammed shoulder to shoulder, shoving and pushing, I knew that a Movement was now set afoot among the German people which would never fade into oblivion. A fire had been kindled from whose glowing heat the sword would be fashioned which would restore freedom to the German Siegfried and bring back life to the German nation.*

*So the committees meet to revise the old programme and draw up a new one, for these people change their convictions just as the soldier changes his shirt in war-time when the old one is lousy. In the new programme, everyone gets everything he wants. The farmer is assured that the interests of agriculture will be safeguarded, the industrialist is assured of protection for his products, the consumer is assured that his interests will be protected in regards to market prices. Teachers are given higher salaries and civil servants will have better pensions. Widows and orphans will receive generous assistance from the State. Trade will be promoted. Tariffs will be lowered and even taxes, though they cannot be entirely abolished, will be almost done away with. It sometimes happens that one section of the public is forgotten or that one of the demands mooted by the public has not reached the ears of the party. In such a case what can still be pushed on to the programme, is hastily added, until finally it is felt that there are good grounds for hoping that the whole host of Philistines, including their wives,*

*When this spirit of public ingratitude reaches a certain pitch, there is only one way of saving the situation. The prestige of the party must be burnished up once again. The programme has to be amended, the committee is called into existence once more, and so the swindle begins anew. Once we understand the impenetrable stupidity of our public, we cannot be surprised that such tactics prove successful. Led by the press and blinded once again by the alluring appearance of the new programme, the bourgeois, as well as the proletarian herds of voters, faithfully return to the fold and reelect their old deceivers. The ‘people’s man’ and labour candidate now change back again into the parliamentarian grub and become fat and rotund as they batten on the leaves that grow on the tree of public life to be retransformed into the glittering butterfly after another four years have passed. Scarcely anything can be so depressing as to watch this process in sober reality and to be forced to observe this repeatedly recurring fraud.*

*Despite the admitted limitations or mental inferiority of the white race’s parliamentary ‘medicine-men,’ they cannot seriously imagine that they can use Western Democracy as a weapon to fight against an ideology whose supporters regard democracy and all its ramifications merely as a means of paralysing their opponents and gaining for themselves a free hand to put their own methods into action. Certain groups of Marxists are, for the time being, using all their ingenuity to create the impression that they are inseparably attached to the principles of democracy. It may be well to recall the fact that, when a crisis arose, these same gentlemen snapped their fingers at the principle of decision by majority vote, as that principle is understood by Western Democracy.*  

- Page 413 (location ~ 6324-6329)    

*Marxism will march shoulder to shoulder with democracy until it succeeds indirectly in securing for its own criminal purposes, even the support of the intelligentsia of the nation whom Marxism has set out to exterminate. But, if the Marxists should one day come to believe that there was a danger that from this witch’s cauldron of our parliamentary democracy a majority might be concocted, which, if merely by reason of its numerical weight, would be in a position to legislate and thus to constitute a serious threat to Marxism, then the whole parliamentarian hocus-pocus would be at an end.*  

- Page 414 (location ~ 6335-6339)    

*At a time when the one side, armed with all the weapons of its Weltanschauung, no matter how criminal, makes an attack against the established order, the other side will be able to resist only if its resistance takes the form of a new faith. In our case, this is a political faith which exchanges the slogans of weak and cowardly defence for the battle-cry of a courageous and ruthless attack. Our present Movement is accused, especially by the socalled national bourgeois cabinet ministers (the Bavarian representatives of the Centre, for example) of heading towards a revolution. We have only one answer to give to those political pygmies, namely, ‘We are trying to remedy that which you, in your criminal stupidity, have failed to accomplish. By your parliamentarian jobbing you have helped to drag the nation into ruin, but we, by our aggressive policy, are setting up a new Weltanschauung which we shall defend with indomitable devotion. Thus we are building the steps on which our nation once again may ascend to the temple of freedom.’ Thus during the first stages of founding our Movement we had to take special care that our militant group, which fought for the establishment of a new and exalted political faith, should not degenerate into a society for the promotion of parliamentarian interests.*

*What I have said about the word ‘religious’ can also be applied to the term völkisch. This word also implies certain fundamental ideas. Though these ideas are very important indeed, they assume such vague and indefinite forms that they cannot be estimated as having a greater value than mere opinions, until they become constituent elements in the structure of a political party. The ideals set forth in a Weltanschauung and the demands arising from them cannot be realised by mere sentiment and inner longing any more than freedom can be won by universal yearning for it. Only when the idealistic longing for independence is organised in such a way that it can fight for its ideal with military force, only then can the urgent wish of a people become a vital reality. Any Weltanschauung, though a thousandfold right and supremely beneficial to humanity, will be of no practical assistance in moulding the life of a people as long as its principles have not yet become the rallying-point of a militant movement which, in its turn, will remain a mere party until its activities have led to the victory of its ideals and its party doctrines form the new fundamental principles of a new national community.*  

- Page 418 (location ~ 6397-6406)    

*Out of the army of millions who feel, more or less clearly, the truth of these ideas, and may even understand them to some extent, one man must arise. This man must have the gift of being able to formulate from the vague ideas held by the masses, principles that will be as clear-cut and firm as granite and he must be able to fight for these principles as the only true ones, until a solid rock of common faith and common will emerges above the troubled waters of vagrant ideas. The general justification for such action lies in the necessity for it and the action of the individual will be justified by his success. If we try to penetrate the inner meaning of the word völkisch we arrive at the following conclusion. The current political conception of the world is that the State, though it possesses a creative force which can build up civilisations, has nothing in common with the concept of race as the foundation of the State.*

*The assumption that all races are alike leads to the assumption that nations and individuals are equal to one another. Therefore, international Marxism is merely the adoption by the Jew, Karl Marx, of a general conception of life, which had existed long before his day, as a definite profession of political faith. If it had not already existed as a widely diffused infection, the amazing political progress of the Marxist teaching would never have been possible. In reality what distinguished Karl Marx from the millions who were affected in the same way was that, in a world already in a state of gradual decomposition, he used the unerring instinct of the prophetic genius to detect the essential poisons, so as to extract them and concentrate them, with the art of an alchemist, in a solution which would bring about the rapid destruction of the independent nations of the earth. All this was done in the service of his race. Thus the Marxian doctrine is the concentrated extract of the mentality which underlies the general Weltanschauung to-day. For this reason alone it is out of the question and even ridiculous to think that what is called our bourgeois world can put up any effective fight against Marxism, for this bourgeois world is permeated with all those same poisons, and its Weltanschauung in general differs from Marxism only in degree and in the character of the persons who hold it.

*The völkisch principle does not admit that one race is equal to another, but by recognising that they are different, separates mankind into races of superior and inferior quality. On the basis of this recognition it feels bound, in conformity with the Eternal Will that dominates the universe, to postulate the victory of the better and stronger and the subordination of the inferior and weaker thus subscribing to Nature’s fundamental aristocratic principle and it believes that this law holds good even down to the last individual organism. It selects individual values from the mass and thus operates as an organising principle, whereas Marxism acts as a disintegrating solvent. The völkisch belief holds that humanity must have its ideals, because ideals are a necessary condition of human existence itself. But, on the other hand, it denies that an ethical ideal has the right to prevail if it endangers the existence of a race that is the champion of a higher ethical ideal, for in a world composed of mongrels and Negroids all ideals of human beauty and nobility and all hopes of an idealised future for humanity would be lost for ever. On this planet of ours human culture and civilisation are indissolubly bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he were to be exterminated or become extinct, then the dark shroud of a new barbaric era would enfold the earth.*

On this planet of ours human culture and civilisation are indissolubly bound up with the presence of the Aryan. If he were to be exterminated or become extinct, then the dark shroud of a new barbaric era would enfold the earth. To undermine the existence of human culture by exterminating its custodians would be an execrable crime in the eyes of those who subscribe to the völkisch Weltanschauung. Whoever dares to raise his hand against the highest image of God, sins against the bountiful Creator of this marvel and contributes to the expulsion from Paradise. Hence the völkisch Weltanschauung is in profound accord with Nature’s most sacred will, because it restores the free play of the forces which, through reciprocal education, will produce a higher type, until finally the best portion of mankind will possess the earth and will be free to work in spheres which lie not only within, but without the limits of that earth. We all feel that in the distant future man may be faced with problems which can be solved only by a superior race of human beings, which is master over all the other peoples and has at its disposal the means and resources of the whole world. It is evident that such a general definition of what is implied by the term völkisch Weltanschauung may easily be interpreted in a thousand different ways.*  

- Page 421 (location ~ 6447-6466)    

*Thus the Marxist conception, directed by a central organisation endowed with supreme authority, is opposed by a medley of opinions which are not ideologically impressive in face of the solid phalanx presented by the enemy. Victory cannot be achieved with such weak weapons. Only when the international Weltanschauung politically directed by organised Marxism is confronted by a völkisch Weltanschauung equally well-organised and equally well-directed will the one side do battle with the other on an equal footing and victory be on the side of eternal truth. The organisation and mobilisation of a Weltanschauung can never be carried out except on a basis of its clear definition. The function which dogma fulfils in religious beliefs comparable to the function which party principles fulfil in a political party which is in the process of being built up. It is, therefore, essential to forge an instrument which, like the Marxist party organisation which clears the way for internationalism, can be used in fighting for this ideal. This is the aim which the National Socialist German Labour Party pursues. That a definite formulation of the idea völkisch in connection with a party movement is a prerequisite for the triumph of the völkisch Weltanschauung is strikingly proved by a fact which is admitted, however indirectly, even by ,those who oppose such an amalgamation of the völkisch idea with party principles. The very people who never tire of insisting again and again that the völkisch Weltanschauung can never be the exclusive property of any individual, because it lies dormant or ‘lives’ in myriads of hearts, only confirm by their own statement the simple fact that the general presence of such ideas in the hearts of millions of men has not proved sufficient to prevent the victory of the opposing ideas, which are, admittedly, championed on the recognised party political lines. If that were not so, the German people ought already to have gained a sweeping victory instead of finding themselves on the brink of the abyss. The international ideology achieved success because it was championed by a militantly organised party. The reason for the failure hitherto sustained by the opposite ideology is that it lacked a united front to fight for its cause.*

*2. The second group is numerically somewhat smaller. It includes those who would make the existence of the State dependent on certain conditions. They insist that not only should there be a uniform system of government, but also, if possible, uniformity of language, if only for technical reasons of administration. The authority of the State is no longer, the sole and exclusive end for which the State exists, but it must also promote the good of its subjects. Ideas of ‘freedom,’ mostly, based on a misunderstanding of the meaning of that word, enter into the concept of the State as it exists in the minds of this group. The form of government is no longer considered inviolable simply because it exists. It must submit to the test of practical efficiency.*  

- Page 426 (location ~ 6524-6530)    

*3. The third group is numerically the smallest. In the State they see a means for the realisation of aims (generally vague in conception) dictated by a policy of power, on the part of a united people speaking the same language. They want a common language not only because they hope that thereby the State will be furnished with a solid basis for the extension of its power beyond its own frontiers, but also because they think—though falling into a fundamental error by so doing—that such a common language would facilitate the carrying out of a definite process of nationalisation. During the last century it was lamentable for those who had to witness it, to notice how in these circles I have just mentioned the word ‘Germanisation’ was frivolously played with, though often with the very best of intentions.*  

- Page 427 (location ~ 6534-6540)    

*What was generally understood by this term was the enforced adoption of the German language, but it is almost inconceivable that people should imagine that a Negro or a Chinaman, for example, can become German simply by learning the German language, by being willing to speak it for the rest of their lives and even to vote in favour of some German political party. Our bourgeois nationalists could never clearly see that such a process of Germanisation is in reality de-Germanisation, for even if all the outstanding and, visible differences between the various peoples could be bridged over and finally eliminated by the use of a common language, this would give rise to a process of bastardisation which in this case would not signify Germanisation, but the annihilation of the German element. In the course of history it has happened only too often that a conquering race succeeded by force in compelling the people whom they had subjected to speak their tongue, with the result that after a thousand years their language was spoken by another people and thus the conqueror finally turned out to be the conquered.*  

- Page 427 (location ~ 6544-6552)    

*It is revolting to think how much damage is indirectly done to German prestige to-day owing to the fact that the German patois of Jews entering the United States enables them to be classed as Germans, because of the ignorance of Americans with regard to things German. Here nobody would dream of accepting the fact that these lousy emigrants from the East generally speak German as proof of their German origin and nationality. What has been beneficially Germanised in the course of history was the land which our ancestors conquered with the sword and colonised with German tillers of the soil. Inasmuch as they introduced foreign blood into our national body in carrying out this colonisation, they helped to bring about the lamentable disintegration of our racial character, a process which has resulted in our German hyper-individualism, though this latter characteristic is, unfortunately, frequently praised even now.*

*Summing up, we arrive at the following conclusion: A common feature of all these views is, that they are not grounded on a recognition of the profound truth that the capacity for creating cultural values is essentially based on the racial element. In accordance with this fact, the paramount purpose of the State to preserve and improve the race, an indispensable condition of all progress in human civilisation. Thus the Jew, Karl Marx, was able to utilise and exploit these false concepts and ideas on the nature and purpose of the State. By eliminating from the concept of the State all thought of the obligation which the State has towards the race, without finding any other formula that might be universally accepted, the bourgeois teaching prepared the way for that doctrine which rejects the State as such. That is why the bourgeois struggle against Marxian internationalism is doomed to fail in this particular. The bourgeois classes have already sacrificed the basic principles which alone could furnish a solid footing for their ideas. Their crafty opponent has perceived the defects in their structure and advances to the assault with those weapons which they themselves have unwittingly placed in his hands. Therefore any new movement which is based on the völkisch Weltanschauung will first of all have to put forward a clear and logical definition of the nature and purpose of the State. The fundamental principle is that the State is not an end in itself, but the means to an end. It is the preliminary condition for the development of a higher form of human civilisation, but not the reason*

In accordance with this fact, the paramount purpose of the State to preserve and improve the race, an indispensable condition of all progress in human civilisation. Thus the Jew, Karl Marx, was able to utilise and exploit these false concepts and ideas on the nature and purpose of the State. By eliminating from the concept of the State all thought of the obligation which the State has towards the race, without finding any other formula that might be universally accepted, the bourgeois teaching prepared the way for that doctrine which rejects the State as such. That is why the bourgeois struggle against Marxian internationalism is doomed to fail in this particular. The bourgeois classes have already sacrificed the basic principles which alone could furnish a solid footing for their ideas. Their crafty opponent has perceived the defects in their structure and advances to the assault with those weapons which they themselves have unwittingly placed in his hands. Therefore any new movement which is based on the völkisch Weltanschauung will first of all have to put forward a clear and logical definition of the nature and purpose of the State. The fundamental principle is that the State is not an end in itself, but the means to an end. It is the preliminary condition for the development of a higher form of human civilisation, but not the reason for such a development, for which a culturally creative race is alone responsible.*

*A State may be considered as a model example if it adequately serves not only the vital needs of the race it represents, but if by its very existence it actually ensures the preservation of this same race, no matter what general cultural significance this constitution may have within the framework of the world. For it is not the task of the State to create human capabilities, but only to assure free scope for the exercise of capabilities that already exist.*

*To many petty German potentates it gave residential capital cities; but the German people as a whole was deprived of its right to rulership. Even to-day our nation still suffers from this lack of inner unity, but what has been the cause of our past and present misfortunes may turn out a blessing for us in the future. Though on the one hand it may be a drawback that our racial elements were not welded together, so that no homogeneous national body could develop, on the other hand, it was fortunate that, since at least a part of our best blood was thus kept pure, its racial quality was not debased. A complete assimilation of all our racial elements would certainly have brought about a homogeneous national organism, but, as has been proved in the case of every racial mixture, it would have been less capable of creating a civilisation than would its best original elements.*

One benefit resulting from the fact that there was no all-round assimilation is the fact that even now we have large groups of German Nordic people within our national organism, and that their blood has not been mixed with the blood of other races. We must look upon this as our most valuable asset for the sake of the future. During that dark period of absolute ignorance in regard to all racial laws, when each individual was considered to be on a par with every other, there could be no clear appreciation of the difference between the various fundamental racial characteristics.*

*Thus a period of stagnation is superseded by a period of effort. And here, and in every other sphere, the proverb holds good, that to rest is to rust, and furthermore the proverb, that victory will always be won by him who attacks. The higher the final goal which we strive to reach, and the less it be understood at the time by the broad masses, the more magnificent will be our success. That is the lesson which history teaches, and the achievement will be all the more significant, if the end is conceived in the right way and the fight carried through with unswerving persistence. Many of the officials who direct the affairs of State nowadays may find it easier to work for the maintenance of the present order than to fight for a new one. They will find it more comfortable to look upon the State as a mechanism, whose purpose is its own preservation, and to say that ‘their lives belong to the State,’ as if anything that grew from the inner life of the nation can logically serve anything but the national life, and as if man could have any finer task than to serve his fellow beings.*

*Just because our task is so great and because so many difficulties have to be overcome, the probability is that only the best kind of protagonist will join our ranks. This selection is the guarantee of our success. Nature generally takes certain measures to correct the effect which racial inter-breeding produces. She is not much in favour of the mongrel. The earlier products of inter-breeding have to suffer bitterly, especially the third, fourth and fifth generations. Not only are they deprived of the higher qualities that belonged to the parents who participated in the first crossing, but they also lack definite will-power and vigorous vital energies, owing to the lack of harmony in the quality of their blood. At all critical moments in which a person of pure racial blood makes correct decisions, that is to say, decisions that are coherent and uniform, the person of mixed blood will become confused and take half-measures. Hence we see that a person of mixed blood is not only relatively inferior to a person of pure blood, but is also doomed to become extinct more rapidly. In innumerable cases where the pure race holds its ground, the mongrel breaks down. Therein we see the corrective measures adopted by Nature; she restricts the possibilities of procreation, thus impeding the fertility of cross-breeds and dooming them to extinction.*  

- Page 440 (location ~ 6745-6755)    

*The threat to the mongrels ceases only with the bastardization of the last members of the superior race who are of unmixed blood. This principle is the source of a slow but constant regeneration whereby all the poison which has invaded the racial body is gradually eliminated as long as there remains a fundamental stock of pure racial elements and there is no further inter-breeding. Such a process may set in automatically among those people where a strong racial instinct has remained. Among such people we may count those elements which, for some particular cause such as coercion, have been thrown out of the normal way of reproduction along strict racial lines. As soon as this compulsion ceases, that part of the race which has remained intact will tend to marry with its own kind and thus impede further intermingling. Then the mongrels recede quite naturally into the background unless their numbers have increased so much as to be able to withstand all serious resistance from those elements which have preserved the purity of their race. When men have lost their natural instincts and ignore the obligations imposed on them by Nature, then there is no hope that Nature will repair the damage that has been caused, until recognition of their own obligations has replaced their lost instincts.*

*One can breed a herd of animals, but from a mixture of this kind, men such as have created and founded civilisations would not be produced. The mission of humanity might then be considered at an end. Those who do not wish that the earth should fall into such a condition must realise that it is the task of the Germanic States in particular to see to it that the process of bastardization is brought to a stop. Our contemporary generation of weaklings will naturally decry such a policy and whine and complain about it as an encroachment on the most sacred of human rights. But there is only one right that is sacrosanct and that right is at the same time a most sacred duty, namely, to protect racial purity so that the best types of human beings may be preserved and thus render possible a more noble development of humanity itself. A völkisch State ought, in the first place, to raise matrimony above the level of continual racial adulteration. The State should consecrate it as an institution for the procreation of creatures made in the likeness of God Himself and not of monsters that are a mixture of man and ape.*

*In this present State of ours, whose function it is to be the guardian of law and order, our national bourgeoisie looks upon it as a crime to make procreation impossible for syphilitics and those who suffer from tuberculosis or hereditary diseases, and also for cripples and imbeciles. But the practical prevention of procreation among millions of our very best people is not considered an evil, nor does it offend against the moral code of this hypocritical class, but rather suits their short-sightedness and mental lethargy, for otherwise they would have to rack their brains to find an answer to the question of how to create conditions for the feeding and maintaining of those yet unborn beings who will be the healthy representatives of our nation and will, in their turn, have to perform the same task for the generation that is to follow them. How devoid of ideals and how ignoble is the whole contemporary system! No effort is being made to perfect the breed for the future, but things are simply allowed to slide. The fact that the churches join in condoning this sin against the image of God, even though they continue to emphasise the dignity of that image, is quite in keeping with their present activities.*  

- Page 444 (location ~ 6794-6803)    

*They talk about the Spirit, but they allow man, as the embodiment of the Spirit, to degenerate to the proletarian level. Then they gape with amazement when they realise how small is the influence of the Christian Faith in their own country and how depraved and ungodly is this riff-raff which is physically degenerate and therefore morally degenerate also. To balance this state of affairs they try to convert the Hottentots, the Zulus and the Kaffirs and to bestow on them the blessings of the Church. While our European people, God be praised and thanked, are left to become the victims of moral depravity, the pious missionary goes out to Central Africa and establishes mission-stations for Negroes. Finally, sound and healthy though primitive and backward people will be transformed, in the name of our ‘higher civilisation,’ into a motley of lazy and brutalized mongrels.*  

- Page 444 (location ~ 6804-6810)    

*It will be the task of the völkisch State to make the race the nucleus of the life of the community. It must make sure that the purity of the racial strain will be preserved. It must proclaim the truth that the child is the most valuable possession a nation can have. It must see to it that only those who are healthy beget children; that there is only one infamy, namely, for parents that are ill or show hereditary defects to bring children into the world and that in such cases it is a matter of honour to refrain from doing so. But, on the other hand, it must be considered as reprehensible to refrain from giving healthy children to the nation. In this matter, the State must assert itself as the trustee of a millennial future, in the face of which the egotistic desires of the individual count for nothing and will have to give way before the ruling of the State.*  

- Page 445 (location ~ 6816-6823)    

*Through education the State must teach individuals that illness is not a disgrace, but an unfortunate accident which is to be pitied, yet that it is a crime and a disgrace to make this affliction worse by passing on disease and defects to innocent creatures, out of mere egotism. The State must also teach the people that it is an expression of a really noble nature and that it is a humanitarian act worthy of admiration if a person who innocently suffers from hereditary disease refrains from having a child of his own, but gives his love and affection to some unknown child who, through its health, promises to become a healthy member of a healthy community. In accomplishing such an educational task the State integrates its practical function by this activity in the moral sphere. It must act on this principle without paying any attention to the question of whether its conduct will be understood or misconstrued, blamed or praised. If, throughout a period of not more than six hundred years, all physically degenerate or mentally defective persons were sterilized, humanity would not only be delivered from an immense misfortune, but also restored to a state of general health such as we at present can hardly imagine.*

*The Weltanschauung which bases the State on the racial idea must finally succeed in bringing about a nobler era, in which men will no longer pay exclusive attention to breeding and rearing pedigree dogs, horses and cats, but will endeavour to improve the breed of the human race itself, That will be an era of self-restraint and renunciation for one class of people, while the others will give their gifts and make their sacrifices joyfully. That such a mentality may be possible cannot be denied in a world where hundreds and thousands accept the principle of celibacy of their own free will, without*

*Either the German youth will one day create a new State founded on the racial idea or they will be the last witnesses of the complete breakdown and death of the bourgeois world. If a generation suffers from defects which it recognises and even admits and is nevertheless quite pleased with itself, as the bourgeois world is to-day, resorting to the cheap excuse that nothing can be done to remedy the situation, then such a generation is doomed to disaster. A marked characteristic of our bourgeois world is that it can no longer deny the evil conditions that exist. It has to admit that there is much which is foul and wrong; but it is unable to make up its mind to fight against that evil, which would mean putting forth the energy to mobilise the forces of sixty or seventy million people and thus oppose the menace.*  

- Page 448 (location ~ 6868-6874)    

*No arguments are too stupid to be employed in defence of their own pettifogging opinions and their moral attitude. If, for instance, a whole continent wages war against alcoholic poisoning, so as to free an entire people from this devastating vice, the only reaction of our European bourgeois is to gape, shake his head and ridicule the movement with a superior sneer—a state of mind which is particularly effective in a society that is so ridiculous. But if all this proves of no avail and in some corner of the world the time-honoured, inviolable routine is attacked, and attacked to some effect, then as has been said, at least the effect must be belittled, even if bourgeois moral principles have to be invoked against a movement, the object of which is to suppress a great moral evil. We must not permit ourselves any illusions on this point. The contemporary bourgeois world has become unfit to perform any such noble task for the sake of humanity, simply because it is of inferior quality and at the same time evil, not so much because it is bent on evil, but because of an all-pervading indolence and its consequences. That is why those political societies which call themselves bourgeois parties are nothing but associations to promote the interests of certain professional groups and classes: Their highest aim is to defend their own egotistic interests as best they can.*  

- Page 449 (location ~ 6876-6886)    

*Just as, in general, racial quality is the preliminary condition for the mental efficiency of any given human material, the training, of the individual will first of all have to be directed towards the development of sound bodily health, for the general rule is that a strong and healthy mind is found only in a strong and healthy body. The fact that men of genius are sometimes not robust in health and stature, and are even of a sickly constitution, is no proof of the falsity of the principle I have enunciated. These cases are only exceptions which, as everywhere else, prove the rule. But when the bulk of a nation is composed of physical degenerates it is rare for a great man to arise from such a miserable motley, and in any case his activities would never meet with great success. A degenerate mob will either be incapable of understanding him at all or their will-power will be so feeble that they cannot follow the soaring flight of such an eagle.*  

- Page 450 (location ~ 6891-6898)    

*The cultivation of the intellectual faculties occupies only second place, and here again it is character which has to be developed first of all, namely, strength of will and the ability to make decisions. The educational system ought to foster a spirit of readiness to accept responsibilities gladly. Formal instruction in the sciences must be considered last in importance. Accordingly, the State which is grounded on the racial idea must start with the principle that a person whose formal education in the sciences is relatively small, but who is physically sound and robust, of a steadfast and honest character, ready and able to make decisions and endowed with strength of will, is a more useful member of the national community than a weakling who is scholarly and refined. A nation composed of learned men who are physically degenerate, or weak-willed and timid pacifists, is not capable of ensuring even its own existence on this earth. In the bitter struggle which decides the destiny of man, it is very rare that an individual has succumbed because he lacked learning. Those who fail are they who try to ignore these consequences and are too faint-hearted to put them into effect. There must be a certain balance between mind and body. A degenerate body is not more beautiful because it houses a radiant spirit.*  

- Page 450 (location ~ 6900-6910)    

*Moltke’s saying, that, in the long run, fortune favours only the efficient, certainly holds good for the relationship between body and spirit. A mind which is sound generally dwells in a body that is sound. Accordingly, in the völkisch State physical training is not a matter for the individual alone, nor is it a duty which first devolves on the parents and is only secondarily a matter of public interest. It is necessary for the preservation of the people, who are represented and protected by the State. As regards purely formal education the State even now interferes with the individual’s right of self-determination and insists upon the right of the community by subjecting the child to an obligatory system of training, without regard to the views of the parents. In a similar way and to a higher degree the new völkisch State will one day make its authority prevail, over the ignorance and incomprehension of individuals in problems appertaining to the safety of the nation.*  

- Page 451 (location ~ 6913-6921)    

*There is one kind of sport which should be especially encouraged, although many people who call themselves völkisch consider it brutal and vulgar, namely, boxing. It is incredible how many false notions prevail among the ‘cultured’ classes. The fact that the young man learns, how to fence and then spends his time in duelling is considered quite natural and respectable. But boxing—that is brutal! Why? There is no other sport which equals this in developing the militant spirit, none that demands such a power of rapid decision or gives the body the flexibility of fine steel. It is no more vulgar for two young people to settle their differences with their fists rather than with sharp-pointed pieces of steel. One who is attacked and defends himself with his fists surely does not act in less manly a fashion than one who runs off and yells for the assistance of a policeman. But, above all, a healthy youth has to learn to endure hard knocks. This principle may appear savage to our contemporary champions who fight only with the weapons of the intellect, but it is not the purpose of the völkisch State to raise a colony of aesthetic pacifists and physical degenerates.*  

- Page 453 (location ~ 6934-6943)    

*If our intellectual upper classes had not been trained exclusively in the art of gentlemanly behaviour and if, on the contrary, they had learned boxing, it would never have been possible for bullies, deserters and other such canaille to carry through a German revolution. For the success of this revolution was not due to the courageous, energetic and audacious activities of its authors, but to the lamentable cowardice and irresolution of those who ruled the German State at that time and were responsible for it. Our educated leaders had received only an ‘intellectual’ training and therefore found themselves defenceless when their adversaries used crowbars instead of intellectual weapons. All this could happen only because our superior scholastic system did not train men to be real men, but merely to be civil servants, engineers, technicians, chemists, litterateurs, jurists and, finally, professors, lest intellectualism die out. Our leaders in the purely intellectual sphere have always been brilliant, but when it came to taking resolute action in practical affairs our leaders have been beneath criticism. Of course, education cannot make a courageous man out of one who is temperamentally a coward, but a man who naturally possesses a certain degree of courage will not be able to develop that quality if his defective education has made him inferior to others from the very start as regards physical strength and prowess. The Army offers the best example of the fact that the knowledge of his physical ability develops a man’s courage and militant spirit. Outstanding heroes were not the rule in the Army, but men of average courage.*  

- Page 453 (location ~ 6946-6958)    

*During the long years of peace before the last war men who were almost physical weaklings were made capable of incredible deeds, and thus a self-confidence was developed which did not fail them even in the most terrible battles. It is our German people, which is now in a state of collapse and helpless to defend itself against the kicks dealt it by the rest of the world, that has need of the power that is the outcome of self-confidence. But this confidence in oneself must be instilled into our children from their very early years. The whole system of education and training must be directed towards fostering in the child the conviction that he is unquestionably a match for anybody and everybody. The individual has to regain his own physical strength and prowess in order to believe in the invincibility of the nation to which he belongs.*  

- Page 454 (location ~ 6962-6968)    

*Only by a superabundance of national energy and a passionate this it for liberty can we recover what has been lost. Again, the manner of clothing the young should be such as harmonises with this purpose. It is really lamentable to see how our young people have fallen victims to a fashion mania which perverts the meaning of the old adage that clothes make the man. Especially in regard to young people, clothes should have their place in educational training. The boy who walks about in summer-time wearing long baggy trousers and clad up to the neck is hampered by his clothes from feeling any inclination towards strenuous physical exercise. Ambition and, to speak quite frankly, even vanity must be appealed to. I do not mean such vanity as leads people to want to wear fine clothes, which not everybody can afford, but rather the vanity which makes a person want to develop a fine physique which everybody can try to do. This is also of value in later years. The young girl must get to know her mate. If the beauty of the body were not completely forced into the background to-day through our stupid manner of dressing, it would not be possible for thousands of our girls to be led astray by Jewish mongrels, with their repulsive crooked waddle. It is also in the interests of the nation that those of beautiful physique should mate in order that they may play their part in providing the nation with fresh beauty. Since we have at present no form of military training and since, consequently, the only institution which, in peacetime at least, partly made up for the lack of physical training in our education is now lacking, what I have suggested is all the more necessary in our time.*  

- Page 455 (location ~ 6975-6988)    

*It is stupid to think that the right of the State to supervise the education of its young citizens suddenly comes to an end the moment they leave school and recommences only with military service. This right is a duty, and as such it must continue uninterruptedly. The present State, which does not interest itself in developing healthy men, has criminally neglected its duty. It leaves our contemporary youth to be, corrupted on the streets and in the brothels, instead of keeping hold of the reins and continuing the physical training of these young people up to the time when they are grown into healthy young men and women. For the present, it is a matter of indifference what form the State chooses for carrying on this training. The essential thing is that it should be developed and that the most suitable ways of doing so should be investigated. The völkisch State will have to consider the physical training of the youth after the school period just as much a public duty as his intellectual training, and this training will have to be carried out through public institutions. On general lines it can be a preparation for subsequent service in the Army, and then it will no longer be the task of the Army to teach the young recruit the most elementary drill regulations. In fact, the Army will no longer have to deal with recruits in the present sense of the word, but will rather have to transform into a soldier the youth whose bodily prowess has already been fully developed.*  

- Page 456 (location ~ 6992-7003)    

*The supreme aim of military education must always be to achieve that which was attributed to the old Army as its highest merit, namely, that through his military schooling the boy must be transformed into a man, that he must not only learn to obey, but also acquire the fundamentals that will enable him one day to command. He must learn to remain silent, not only when he is justly rebuked, but also when he is unjustly rebuked. Furthermore, in the consciousness of his own strength and on the basis of that esprit de corps which inspires him and his comrades, he must become convinced that he belongs to a nation which is invincible. After he has completed his military training two certificates shall be handed to the soldier. The one will be his diploma as a citizen of the State, a juridical document which will enable him to take part in public affairs. The second will be an attestation of his physical health, which guarantees his fitness for marriage. The völkisch State will have to direct the education of girls just as that of boys and according to the same fundamental principles. Here again, special importance must be assigned to physical training, and only after that must the importance of spiritual and mental training be taken into account.*

*Of course, the essential traits of the individual character are already there before any education takes place. A person who is fundamentally egotistic will always remain fundamentally egotistic, and the idealist will always remain fundamentally an idealist. Besides those, however, who already possess a definite stamp of character there are millions of people with characters that are indefinite and vague. The born delinquent will always remain a delinquent, but numerous people who show only a certain tendency to commit criminal acts may become useful members of the community if rightly trained; whereas, on the other hand, weak and unstable characters may easily become evil elements if the system of education is bad. During the War it was often lamented that our people could be so little reticent. This failing made it very difficult to keep even highly important secrets from the knowledge of the enemy.*

*Is it not true that then, as well as now, complaining about others was considered praiseworthy ‘candour,’ while silent discretion was taken as obstinacy? Has any attempt ever been made to teach the young that discretion is a precious and manly virtue? No, for such matters are trifles in the eyes of our education authorities. But these trifles cost our State innumerable millions in legal expenses, for ninety per cent of all the processes for defamation and similar charges arise only from a lack of discretion. Remarks that are made without any sense of responsibility are thoughtlessly repeated from mouth to mouth, and our economic welfare is continually damaged because important methods of production are carelessly disclosed. Secret preparations for our national defence are rendered illusory because our people have never learned the duty of silence. They repeat everything they happen to hear. In time of war such talkative habits may even cause the loss of battles and may therefore contribute essentially for the unsuccessful outcome of a campaign. Here, as in other matters, we may rest assured that adults cannot do what they have not learnt to do in youth. A teacher must not try to discover the wild tricks of the boys by encouraging the evil practice of tale-bearing.*

*A boy who tells on his comrades commits an act of treason and shows a bent of character which is, to speak bluntly, similar to that of a man who commit; high treason. Such a boy must not be classed as ‘good,’ ‘reliable,’ and so on, but rather as one with undesirable traits of character. It may be rather convenient for the teacher to make use of such unworthy tendencies in order to help him in his own work, but by such an attitude the germ of a moral habit is sown in young hearts and may one day have fatal consequences. It has happened more often than once that a young informer developed into a scoundrel. This is only one example among many. The deliberate training of fine and noble traits of character in our schools to-day is almost negative. In the future much more emphasis will have to be laid on this side of our educational work. Loyalty, self-sacrifice, and discretion are virtues which a great nation must possess, and the teaching and development of these in the schools is a more important matter than many other things now included in the curriculum. To make the children give up habits of complaining, whining and howling when they are hurt, etc., also belongs to this part of their training. If the educational system fails to teach the child at an early age to endure pain and injury without complaining we cannot be surprised, if at a later age, when the boy has grown to manhood and is, for example, in the trenches, the postal service is used for nothing but to send home letters full of grumbles and complaints.*

*In its educational system the völkisch State will have to attach the highest importance to the development of character, hand-in-hand with physical training. Many more defects which our rational organism betrays at present could be ameliorated, if not completely eliminated, by education of the right kind. Extreme importance should be attached to the training of will-power and young people should be trained to make firm decisions and to accept responsibility. In the training of our old Army the principle was in vogue that any order is always better than no order. Applied to our youth this principle ought to take the form that any answer is better than no answer. The fear of replying, because one fears to be wrong, ought to be considered more humiliating than giving thee wrong reply. On this simple and primitive basis, our youth should be trained to have the courage to act. It has been often lamented that in November and December 1918 all the authorities lost their heads and that, from the monarch down to the last divisional commander, nobody had sufficient mettle to make a decision on his own responsibility.*

*Quite unsuspectingly, a German general found a formula for this lamentable lack of the will-to-act when he said, “I act only when I can count on a fifty-one per cent chance of success.” In that ‘fifty-one per cent chance’ we find the very key to the German collapse. The man who demands from Fate a guarantee of his success deliberately denies the significance of heroic action, for this significance consists in the very fact that, in the definite knowledge that the situation in question is fraught with mortal danger, an action is undertaken which may lead to success. A patient suffering from cancer, who knows that his death is certain if he does not undergo an operation, needs no assurance of a fifty-one per cent chance of a cure before facing the operation, and if the operation promise only a fraction of a one per cent probability of success; a man of courage would risk it and he who does not take the risk has no right to whine.*

*The curriculum of the primary and central schools presents an odd mixture at the present time. In many branches of study the subject matter to be learned has become so enormous that only a very small fraction of it can be remembered later on, and indeed only a very small fraction of this whole mass of knowledge can be used. On the other hand, what is learned is insufficient for anybody who wishes to specialise in any certain branch for the purpose of earning his daily bread. Take, for example, the average civil servant who has passed through the Gymnasium or High School, and ask him, at the age of thirty or forty, how much he has retained of the knowledge that was crammed into him with so much pains. How much is retained of all that was stuffed into his brain? He will certainly answer, “Well, the sole purpose of all I swotted up in those days was not to provide me with a great stock of knowledge from which I could draw in later years; but it served to develop the understanding, the memory, and above all it helped to strengthen the thinking power of the brain.” That is partly true. And yet it is somewhat dangerous to submerge a young brain in a flood of impressions, which it can hardly master and the single elements of which it cannot discern or appreciate at their true value. It is mostly the essential part of this knowledge, and not the incidental, that is forgotten and sacrificed. Thus the principal purpose of this copious instruction is frustrated, for that purpose cannot be to make the brain capable of learning by simply offering it an enormous and varied amount of subjects for acquisition, but rather to furnish the individual with that stock of knowledge, which he will need in later life and which he can use for the good of the community.*  

- Page 463 (location ~ 7088-7102)    

*There is no reason why millions of people should learn two or three languages during their school years, when only a very small fraction will have the opportunity to use these languages in later life and when most of them will therefore forget these languages completely. To take one instance, out of one hundred thousand students who learn French there are probably not two thousand who will be in a position to make use of this accomplishment in later life, while ninety-eight thousand will never have a chance to utilise in practice what they have learned in youth.*

*There is no reason why millions of people should learn two or three languages during their school years, when only a very small fraction will have the opportunity to use these languages in later life and when most of them will therefore forget these languages completely. To take one instance, out of one hundred thousand students who learn French there are probably not two thousand who will be in a position to make use of this accomplishment in later life, while ninety-eight thousand will never have a chance to utilise in practice what they have learned in youth. They have spent thousands of hours on a subject which will afterwards be of no value or importance to them. The argument that these, subjects form part of a general education is invalid. It would be sound if all these people were able to use this learning in after-life. But, as matters stand, ninety-eight thousand are tortured to no purpose and waste valuable time, for the sake of the two thousand to whom the language will be of any use. In the case of that language which I have chosen as an example it cannot be said that the learning of it educates the student in logical thinking or sharpens his mental acumen, as the learning of Latin, for instance, might be said to do. It would, therefore, be much better to teach young students only the general outline or, better, the inner structure of such a language, that is to say, to allow them to discern the characteristic features of the language, or perhaps to make them acquainted with the rudiments of its grammar, its pronunciation, its syntax, style, etc. That would be sufficient for average students, because it would provide a clearer view of the whole and could be more easily remembered and would be more practical than the present-day attempt to cram into their heads detailed knowledge of the whole language, which they can never master and which they will readily forget.*

*In ninety-nine out of one hundred cases the results of our present teaching of history are deplorable. Usually only a few dates, years of birth and names, remain in the memory, while a knowledge of the main and clearly defined lines of historical development is completely lacking. The essential features which are of real significance are not taught. It is left to the more or less bright intelligence of the individual to discover the inner motivating urge amid the mass of dates and chronological succession of events. You may object as strongly as you like to this unpleasant statement, but read with attention the speeches which our parliamentarians make during one single session on the problems connected with, let us say, foreign policy. Remember that these gentlemen are, or claim to be, the elite of the German nation and that at least a great number of them have sat on the benches of our secondary schools and that many of them have passed through our universities. Then you will realise how defective the historical education of these men has been. If these gentlemen had never studied history at all, but had possessed a sound instinct for public affairs, things would have gone better, and the nation would have benefited greatly thereby.*

*Finally, it is the business of the völkisch State to arrange for the writing of a world history in which the racial problem will occupy a dominant position. To sum up: The völkisch State must reconstruct our system of general instruction in such a way that it will embrace only what is essential. Beyond this it will have to make provision for more advanced teaching in the various subjects for those who want to specialise in them. It will suffice for the average individual to be acquainted with the fundamentals of the various subjects to serve as the basis of what may be called an all-round education. He ought to study exhaustively and in detail only that subject in which he intends to work during the rest of his life. General instruction in all subjects should be obligatory, and specialisation should be left to the choice of the individual. In this way the scholastic programme would be shortened, and thus several school hours would be gained which could be utilised for physical exercise and character training in will-power, the capacity for making practical judgments, decisions, etc. The little account taken by our school training to-day, especially in the central schools, of the callings that have to be followed in after-life is demonstrated by the fact that men who are destined for the same calling in life are educated in three different kinds of schools. What is of decisive importance is general education and not specialised teaching. When special knowledge is needed it cannot be given in the curriculum of our central schools as they are to-day. The völkisch State will, therefore, one day have to abolish such half-measures. The second modification in the curriculum which the völkisch State will have to make is the following: It is a characteristic of our materialistic epoch that our scientific education shows a growing emphasis on what is real and practical, on such subjects as, for instance, applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Of course, they are necessary in an age that is dominated by industrial technology and chemistry, and of which they are, externally at least, a most significant factor of everyday life, but it is dangerous to base the general education of the nation on a knowledge of, these subjects to the exclusion of all others.*  

- Page 467 (location ~ 7150-7168)    

*The conflict of our time is one that is being waged around great objectives. A civilisation is fighting for its existence. It is a civilisation that is the product of thousands of years of historical development, and the Greek as well as the German forms part of it. A clear-cut division must be made between general education and specialised subjects. Today the latter threaten more and more to become debased in the service of Mammon. To counterbalance this tendency, general culture should be preserved, at least in its ideal forms. The principle should be repeatedly emphasised, that industrial and technical progress, trade and commerce, can flourish only as long as a folk-community inspired by ideals provides the requisite basis. That condition is not created by a spirit of materialistic egotism, but by a spirit of self-denial and the joy of giving oneself in the service of others.*

*Dawes Plan, but for its existence and defence it will need precisely those things with which our*  

- Page 471 (location ~ 7221-7221)    

*They love the German Republic and tolerate its existence because no better instrument could be found to help them to keep our people in slavery. It is to this fact alone that this magnanimous institution owes its survival. That is why it can dispense with, any real system of national education and can feel satisfied when the heroes who belong to the Reich Banner organisation shout their hurrahs, but in reality these same heroes would scamper away like rabbits if called upon to defend that banner with their blood. The völkisch State will have to fight for its existence. It will neither gain nor secure this existence by signing documents like the Dawes Plan, but for its existence and defence it will need precisely those things with which our present system believes it can dispense. The more worthy its form and its inner national character, the greater will be the envy and opposition of its adversaries. The best defence will not be in the arms it possesses, but in its citizens. It is not fortresses that will protect it, but the living wall of its men and women, filled with an ardent love for their country and a passionate spirit of national patriotism. Therefore, the third point which will have to be considered in relation to our educational system is the following: The völkisch State must realise that the sciences may also be made a means of promoting a spirit of pride in the nation.*  

- Page 471 (location ~ 7216-7226)    

*But out of the abundance of great names in German history the greatest will have to be selected and presented to our younger generation in such a way as to become solid pillars of strength to support the national spirit. The subject matter ought to be systematically organised from the standpoint of this principle, and the teaching should be so orientated that the boy or girl, after leaving school, will not be a semi-pacifist, a democrat or something else of that kind, but a wholehearted German. In order that this national feeling be sincere from the very beginning, and not a mere pretence, the following fundamental and inflexible principle should be impressed on the young brain while it is yet malleable: The man who loves his nation can prove the sincerity of this sentiment only by being ready to make sacrifices for the nation’s welfare. There is no such thing as a national sentiment which is directed towards personal interests, and there is no such thing as a nationalism that embraces only certain classes. Hurrahing proves nothing and does not confer the right to call oneself national if behind that shout there is no sincere preoccupation for the conservation of the nation’s well-being.*  

- Page 472 (location ~ 7230-7239)    

*One thing is certain, namely, that our world is facing a great revolution. The only question is whether the outcome will be propitious for the Aryan portion of mankind or whether the everlasting Jew will profit by it. By educating the younger generation along the right lines, the völkisch State will have to see to it that a generation of men will arise fit to play its part in this supreme and final combat that will decide the destiny of the world. That nation will conquer which is the first to take this road. The whole organisation of education and training which the völkisch State is to build up must regard as its crowning task the work of instilling into the hearts and minds of the youth entrusted to it the racial instinct and understanding of the racial idea.*  

- Page 473 (location ~ 7250-7256)    

*It would even be possible to force a person of mediocre intelligence, by means of an intensive course of intellectual drilling, to acquire more than the average amount of knowledge; but that knowledge would remain sterile. The result would be a man who might be a walking dictionary of knowledge, but who would fail miserably on every critical occasion in life and at every juncture where vital decisions had to be taken. Such people need to be drilled specially for every new and even most insignificant task and will never be capable, of contributing in the least to the general progress of mankind. Knowledge that is merely drilled into people can at best qualify them to fill government positions under our present regime. It goes without saying that, among the sum total of individuals who make up a nation, gifted people are always to be found in every sphere of life.*  

- Page 476 (location ~ 7286-7293)    

*From time to time our illustrated papers publish, for the edification of the German Philistine, the news that in some quarter or other of the globe, and for the first time in that locality, a Negro has become a lawyer, a teacher, a pastor, or even a grand opera singer or something else of that kind. While the bourgeois blockhead stares with amazed admiration at the paragraph that tells him how marvellous are the achievements of our modern educational technique, the more cunning Jew sees in this fact a new proof to be utilised for the spreading of the theory with which he wants to infect the public, namely, that all men are equal. It does not dawn on the murky bourgeois mind that the fact which is published for him is a sin against reason itself, that it is an act of criminal insanity to train a being who is only an anthropoid by birth until the pretence can be made that he has been turned into a lawyer; while, on the other hand, millions who belong to the most civilised races have to remain in positions which are unworthy of their cultural level. The bourgeois mind does not realise that it is a sin against the will of the eternal Creator to allow hundreds of thousands of highly gifted people to remain floundering in the swamp of proletarian misery, while Hottentots and Zulus are drilled to fill positions in the intellectual professions.*  

- Page 476 (location ~ 7296-7306)    

*A stock of knowledge packed into the brain will not suffice for the making of discoveries. What counts here is only that knowledge which is illuminated by natural talent, but with us at the present time no value is placed on such gifts. Only good school reports count. Here is another educative work that is waiting for the völkisch State to accomplish. It will not be its task to assure a dominant influence to a certain social class already existing, but it will be its duty to attract the most competent brains in the total mass of the nation and promote them to place and honour. It is not merely the duty of the State to give to the average child a certain amount of education in the primary school, but it is also its duty to make it possible for talent to develop, and above all, it must open the doors of the colleges and universities to talent of every sort, no matter in what social circles it may appear. This is an imperative necessity, for thus alone will it be possible to develop a talented body of public leaders from among the class which has acquired sterile learning.*  

- Page 478 (location ~ 7315-7323)    

*For example, the more ‘intellectual’ our statesmen have been, the more lacking they have been, for the most part, in practical achievement. Our political preparation and our technical equipment for the World War were defective, certainly not because the brains governing the nation were too little educated, but because the men who directed our public affairs were over-educated, filled to overflowing with knowledge and intelligence, yet without any sound instinct and simply without energy, or any spirit of daring. It was our nation’s tragedy to have to fight for its existence under a Chancellor who was a dilly-dallying philosopher. If, instead of a Bethmann-Hollweg, we had had a more robust man of the people as our leader, the heroic blood of the common grenadier would not have been shed in vain.*  

- Page 478 (location ~ 7330-7335)    

*The objection will at once be raised, that it is too much to expect from the favourite son of a highly-placed civil servant, for instance, that he shall work with his hands simply because somebody else, whose parents belong to the working-class, seems more capable of filling a job in the civil service. That argument may be valid as long as manual work is looked upon as it is looked upon to-day. Hence the völkisch State will have to take up an attitude towards the appreciation of manual labour which will be fundamentally different from that which now exists. If necessary, it will have to organise a persistent system of teaching which will aim at abolishing the stupid present-day habit of looking down on manual labour as an occupation of which to be ashamed. The individual will have to be valued, not by the class of work he does, but by the way in which he does it and by its usefulness to the community. This statement may sound monstrous in an epoch when the most brainless column-writer on a newspaper staff is more esteemed than the most expert mechanic, merely because the former pushes a pen.*  

- Page 480 (location ~ 7357-7365)    

*It is on this that a man’s value must be estimated, and not on the amount of recompense received. In a sensibly governed State care must be taken that each individual is given the kind of work which corresponds to his capabilities. In other words, people will be trained for the positions indicated by their natural endowments; but these endowments or faculties are innate and cannot be acquired by any amount of training, being a gift of Nature and not the reward of effort. Therefore, the way in which men are generally esteemed by their fellow-citizens must not be according to the kind of work they do, because that has been more or less assigned to the individual. Seeing that the kind of work on which the individual is employed is determined by his circumstances and the training which he has, in consequence, received from the community. He will have to be judged by the way in which he performs the work entrusted to him by the community, for the work which the individual performs is not the purpose of his existence, but only a means of livelihood. His real purpose in life is to better himself and raise himself to a higher level as a human being; but this he can only do in and through the community, whose cultural life he shares and this community must always exist on the foundations of a State. He must contribute to the conservation of those foundations. Nature determines the form of this contribution. It is the duty of the individual to return to the community, zealously and honestly, what the community has given him.*  

- Page 482 (location ~ 7378-7389)    

*The present epoch is working out its own ruin. It introduces universal suffrage and chatters about equal rights, but can find no foundation for this equality. It considers the material wage as the expression of a man’s value and thus destroys the basis of the noblest kind of equality that can exist, for equality cannot and does not depend on the work a man does, but only on the manner in which each one does the particular work allotted to him. Thus alone will the mere accident of birth be set aside in determining the worth of a man and thus only does the individual become the creator of his own social worth.*  

- Page 483 (location ~ 7396-7401)    

*At the present time, when whole groups of people estimate each other’s value only by the size of the salaries which they respectively receive, there can be no understanding of all this, but that is no reason why we should cease to champion these ideas. On the contrary, in an epoch which is inwardly diseased and decaying anyone who would heal it must have the courage first to probe to the real roots of the disease. The National Socialist Movement must take that duty on its shoulders, it must act over the heads of the small bourgeoisie and rally together and coordinate all those elements within the community which are fit to become the protagonists of a new Weltanschauung. Of course the objection will be made that in general it is difficult to differentiate between the material and ideal values of work and that the lower prestige which is attached to manual labour is due to the fact that smaller wages are paid for that kind of work. It will be said that the lower wage is, in its turn, the reason why the manual worker has less chance to participate in the culture of the nation, so that the ideal side of human culture is less open to him although it may have nothing to do with his daily activities. It may be added that reluctance to do physical work is justified by the fact that, on account of his low wages the cultural level of the manual labourer must naturally be low, and that this in turn is a justification for the lower estimation in which manual labour is generally held. There is a good deal of truth in all this, but that is the very reason why we ought to see that in future there should not be such a wide difference in the scale of remuneration. We will not entertain the argument that under such condition: poorer work would be done. It would be the saddest symptom of decadence if finer intellectual work could be obtained only through the stimulus of higher payment.*  

- Page 483 (location ~ 7401-7415)    

*Let it not be said that this is merely a visionary ideal, that this world would never tolerate it in practice and that of itself it is impossible to attain. Even we are not so simple as to believe that there will ever be an age in which there will be no drawbacks, but that does not release us from the obligation to fight for the removal of the defects which we have recognised, to overcome the shortcomings and to strive towards the ideal. In any case, the hard reality of the facts to be faced will always place only too many limits on our aspirations. But that is precisely why man must strive again and again to serve the ultimate aim. No failures must induce him to renounce his intentions, just as we cannot spurn the sway of justice because mistakes creep into the administration of the law, and just as we cannot despise medical science because, in spite of it, there will always be disease. Man should take care not to have too low an estimate of the power of an ideal. If there are some who feel disheartened over present conditions, and if they happen to have served as soldiers, I would remind them of the time when their heroism was the most convincing example of the power inherent in ideal motives. It was not preoccupation about their daily bread that led men to sacrifice their lives, but love of their country, the faith which they had in its greatness, and the common struggle to uphold the honour of the nation.*

*If the affairs of the candidate are such that it appears likely he will turn out to be a good taxpayer, that is a very important consideration and will help him to obtain civic rights all the more rapidly. The question of race plays no part at all. The whole process of acquiring civic rights is not very different from that of being admitted to membership of an automobile club, for instance: A person files his application; it is examined; it is sanctioned, and one day the man receives a card which informs him that he has become a citizen. The information is given in an amusing way. An applicant who has hitherto been a Zulu or a Kaffir is informed, “By these presents you have now become a German citizen.” The President of the State can perform this piece of magic. What God Himself could not do is achieved by some Theophrastus Paracelsus of a civil servant. A stroke of the pen, and a Mongolian slave is forthwith turned into a real ‘German’.*  

- Page 487 (location ~ 7453-7460)    

*The völkisch State will classify its population in three groups, namely, citizens, subjects of the State, and aliens. The principle is that birth within the confines of the State gives only the status of a subject. It does not carry with it the right to fill any position under the State or to participate in political life, such as taking an active or passive part in elections. Another principle is that the race and nationality of every subject of the State will have to be proved. A subject is at any time free to cease being a subject and to become a citizen of that country to which he belongs in virtue of his nationality. The only difference between an alien and a subject of the State is that the former is a citizen of another country. A boy of German nationality who is a subject of the German State is bound to complete the period of school education which is obligatory for every German. Thereby he submits to the system of training which will make him, race-conscious and make him realise that he is a member of the folk-community.*  

- Page 488 (location ~ 7473-7481)    

*It would be absurd to appraise a man’s worth by the race to which he belongs, and at the same time to make war against the Marxist principle that all men are equal, without being determined to pursue our own principle to its logical conclusion. If we admit the significance of blood, that is to say, if we recognise the race as the fundamental element on which all life is based, we shall have to apply to the individual the logical consequences of this principle. In general I must estimate the worth of nations differently, on the basis of the different races from which they spring, and I must also differentiate in estimating the, worth of the individual within his own race. The principle that one people is not the same as another, applies also to the individual members of a national community, just as no one man, for instance, is equal to another, because the constituent elements belonging to the same blood vary in a thousand subtle details, though they are fundamentally of the same quality. The first consequence of recognition of this fact is, if I may use such an expression, somewhat crude, being an attempt to help and promote those elements within the folk-community which are of particular value from the racial point of view and to encourage them to increase and multiply. This task is comparatively simple because it can be recognised and carried out almost mechanically.*

*Certain tricks and skilful tactics which can be observed among animals strike the eye of the observer as established facts which may be seen everywhere and man is no longer in a position to discover or explain their primary cause and so he contents himself with calling such phenomena instinctive. In our case, this term has no meaning, because everyone who believes in the higher evolution of living organisms must admit that every manifestation of the vital urge and struggle to live must have had a definite, beginning in time and that one subject alone must have manifested it for the first time. It was then repeated again and again, and the practice of it spread over a widening area, until finally it passed into the subconsciousness of every member of the species, where it manifested itself as ‘instinct.’ This is more easily understood and more easy to believe in the case of man. His first skilled tactics in the struggle against the rest of the animals undoubtedly originated with individuals possessing special capabilities. There can be no doubt that personality was then the sole factor in all decisions and achievements which were afterwards taken over by the whole of humanity as a matter of course. An exact exemplification of this may be found in those fundamental military principles which have now become the basis of all strategy in war. Originally, they sprang from the brain of a single individual and in the course of many years, maybe even thousands of years, they were accepted all around as a matter of course and thus gained universal validity. Man supplemented his first discovery by making a second. Among other things he learned how to master other living beings and make then serve him in his struggle for existence, and thus began the real inventive activity of mankind, as it is now evident to its. Those material inventions, beginning with the use of stones as weapons, which led to the domestication of animals and the production of fire by artificial means, down to the many marvellous inventions of our own day, reveal more clearly the individual as the originator, the nearer we come to our own time and the more important and revolutionary the inventions become.*  

- Page 492 (location ~ 7534-7551)    

*The first and supreme duty of an organised folk-community is to place the inventor in a position where he can be of the greatest benefit to all. Indeed, the very purpose of the organisation is to put this principle into practice. Only by so doing can it ward off the curse of mechanisation and become a living thing. In itself it must personify the effort to place men of brains above the multitude and to make the latter obey the former. Therefore, not only does the organisation possess no right to prevent men of brains from rising above the multitude but, on the contrary, it must use its organising powers to enable and promote their progress as far as it possibly can. It must set out from the principle that the blessings of mankind never came from the masses, but from the creative brains of individuals, who are therefore the real benefactors of humanity. It is in the interest of all to ensure men of creative brains a decisive influence and facilitate their work. This common interest is surely not served by allowing the multitude to rule, for it is not capable of thinking nor is it efficient and in no circumstances whatsoever can it be said to be gifted. Only those should rule who have the natural temperament and gifts of leadership.*  

- Page 494 (location ~ 7571-7580)    

*The idea of personality, of the authority of the individual over his subordinates and of the responsibility of the individual towards the persons who are placed over him dominates in every sphere of life. It is only in political life that this very natural principle has been completely ignored. Though all human civilisation has resulted exclusively from the creative activity of the individual, the principle that it is ‘the majority which counts,’ persists throughout the entire, national community and more especially as regards its administration, whence the poison gradually filters into all branches of national life, thus causing a veritable decomposition. The destructive activities of Judaism in different parts of the national body can be ascribed fundamentally to the persistent Jewish efforts at undermining the importance of personality among the nations that are their hosts and, in place of personality, substituting the domination of the masses. The constructive principle of Aryan humanity is thus displaced by the destructive principle of the Jews. They are the ferment of decomposition’ among nations and races and, in a broad sense, the wreckers of human civilisation. Marxism represents the most striking phase of the Jewish endeavour to eliminate the dominant significance of personality in every sphere of human life and to replace it by the numerical power of the masses. In politics the parliamentary form of government is the expression of this effort. We can observe the fatal effects of it everywhere, from the smallest parish council upwards to the highest government circles in the Reich.*

*Even if, on the basis of its mass-theory, Marxism should prove itself capable of taking over and developing the present economic system, this would not be of vital significance. The question as to whether the Marxist doctrine be right or wrong cannot be decided by any test which would show that it can administer for futurity what already exists to-day. It need only be asked whether it has the creative power to build up, according to its own principles, a civilisation which would be a counterpart of what already exists. Even if Marxism were a thousandfold capable of taking over the economic system as we now have it, and of maintaining it in operation under Marxist direction, such an achievement would prove nothing. This is because, on the basis of its own principles, Marxism would never be able to create anything which could supplant what exists to-day. Marxism itself has furnished the proof that it cannot do this. Not only has it been unable to create a cultural or economic system of its own anywhere; but it was not even able to develop, according to its own principles, the civilisation and economic system it found ready to hand. It has had to make compromises, by way of a return to the principle of personality, nor can it dispense with that principle in its own organisation. The völkisch Weltanschauung differs fundamentally from the Marxist by reason of the fact that the former recognises the significance of race and therefore also of personal worth and has made these the pillars of its structure.*

*The völkisch State must ensure the welfare of its citizens by recognising the importance of the individual in all circumstances and by preparing the way for the maximum of productive efficiency in all the various branches of economic life, thus securing to the individual the highest possible share in the general output. Hence, the völkisch State must mercilessly eliminate from all the leading circles in the government of the country the parliamentarian principle, according to which decisive power through the majority vote is invested in the multitude. Personal responsibility must be substituted in its stead. Thus we arrive at the following conclusion; The best constitution and the best form of government is that which, as a matter of course, renders it possible for the best brains to reach a position of dominant importance and influence in the community. Just as in the field of economics men of outstanding ability cannot be selected from above, but must come to the fore by virtue of their own efforts, and just as there is an unceasing educative process that leads from the smallest shop to the largest undertaking, and just as life itself provides the necessary tests, so in the political field it is not possible to ‘discover’ political talent at short notice.*

*Consequently, the State must divide its representative bodies into a political chamber and a corporative chamber that represents the respective trades and professions. To assure effective cooperation between those two bodies, a selected body, or senate will be placed ever them. No vote will be taken in the chambers or in the senate. They are to be organisations for work and not voting machines. The individual members will have consultative votes, but no right of decision will be attached thereto. The right of decision belongs exclusively to the president, who must be entirely responsible for the matter under discussion. This principle of combining absolute authority with absolute responsibility will gradually cause a selected group of leaders to emerge—a thing which is impossible in our present epoch of irresponsible parliamentarianism. The political construction of the nation will thereby be brought into harmony with those laws to which the nation already owes its greatness in the economic and cultural spheres. Regarding the possibility of putting these principles into practice, I should like to call attention to the fact that the principle of parliamentarian democracy, whereby decisions are enacted through the majority vote, has not always ruled the world. On the contrary, we find it prevalent only during short periods of history and these have always been periods of decline in nations and States. One must not believe, however, that such a radical change could be effected by measures of a purely theoretical character, operating from above downwards. The change I have been describing could not be limited to transforming the constitution of a State, but would have to include the various fields of legislation and civic existence as a whole.*  

- Page 499 (location ~ 7651-7664)    

*The parties which exist at present and which draw their, profits from the State, as it now is, cannot be expected to bring about a radical change in the regime or to change their attitude on their own initiative. This is rendered all the more impossible because those who now have the direction of affairs in their hands are all of them Jews. The trend of development which we are now experiencing would, if allowed to go on unchecked, lead to the realisation of the pan-Jewish prophecy that the Jews will one day devour the other nations and become lords of the earth. In contrast to the millions of ‘bourgeois’ and ‘proletarian’ Germans, who are stumbling to their ruin, mostly through timidity, indolence and stupidity, the Jew pursues his way persistently and keeps his eye always fixed on his future goal. Any party that is led by him fights for no other interests than his, and his interests certainly have nothing in common with those of the Aryan nations.*

*If we would transform our ideal picture of the völkisch State into a reality we shall have to keep independent of the forces that now control public life and seek for new forces that will be ready and capable of taking up the fight for such an ideal. For a fight it will have to be, since the first task will not be to build up the idea of the völkisch State, but rather to wipe out the Jewish State which now exists. As so often happens in the course of history, the main difficulty is not to establish a new order of things, but to clear the ground for its establishment. Prejudices and egotistic interests join together in forming a common front against the new idea and in trying by every means to prevent its triumph, because it is disagreeable to them or threatens their existence. That is why the protagonist of the new idea is, unfortunately, in spite of his desire for constructive work, compelled to wage a destructive battle first, in order to abolish the existing state of affairs. A doctrine whose principles are radically new and of essential importance must adopt the sharp probe of criticism as its weapon, though this may prove disagreeable to the individual followers. It is evidence of a very superficial insight into historical developments if the supporters of the socalled pseudo-völkisch movement emphasise again and again that they will, in no circumstances, adopt the use of negative criticism, but will engage only in constructive work.*  

- Page 501 (location ~ 7680-7691)    

*Marxism, too, has had its aims to pursue and converted and won over to the new movement simply by being shown that something new is necessary. On the contrary, what may easily happen is that two different situations will exist side by side and that a Weltanschauung is transformed into a party, above which level it will not be able to raise itself afterwards, for a Weltanschauung is intolerant and cannot permit another to exist side by side with it. It imperiously demands its own recognition as unique and exclusive, and insists upon a complete reformation of public life in all its branches, in accordance with its views. It can never allow the previous state of affairs to continue in existence alongside it. The same holds true of religions. Christianity was, not content with erecting an altar of its own. It had first to destroy the pagan altars. It was only by virtue of this passionate intolerance that an apodictic faith could grow up, and intolerance is an indispensable condition for the growth of such a faith. It may be objected here that in these phenomena which we find throughout the history of the world we have to recognise mostly a specifically Jewish mode of thought and that such fanaticism and intolerance are typical symptoms of the Jewish mentality. This may be true a thousand times over and we may regret that it is so and note with a feeling of uneasiness that this phenomenon has hitherto been unknown in the history of mankind—but the hard fact remains that such is the situation to-day. It is not the business of the men who wish to liberate our German nation from the conditions is in which it now exists to burden their brains with thinking how excellent it would be if this or that had never occurred. They must strive to find ways and means of abolishing what actually exists.*  

- Page 502 (location ~ 7693-7707)    

*Each one of us today may regret the fact that the advent of Christianity was the first occasion on which spiritual terror was introduced into the much freer ancient world, but the fact cannot be denied that ever since then, the world has been pervaded and dominated by this kind of coercion and that violence is broken only by violence and terrorism by terrorism. Only then can a new regime be created by means of constructive work. Political parties are prone to make compromises, but a Weltanschauung never does this. A political party even reckons with opponents, but a Weltanschauung proclaims its own infallibility. In the beginning, political parties have nearly always the intention of securing exclusive and despotic domination for themselves.*  

- Page 503 (location ~ 7709-7715)    

*The spirit of conciliation, which animates their will, attracts those petty and chicken-hearted people who are not fit to take part in any crusade. That is the reason why they mostly become stuck in their miserable pettiness very early on the march. They give up fighting for their ideology and, by way of what they call ‘positive collaboration,’ they try as quickly as possible to wedge themselves into some tiny place at the trough of the existent regime and to stick there as long as possible. Their whole effort ends at that, and if they should get shouldered away from the common manger by competitors with more brutal manners, then their only idea is to force themselves in again, by force or chicanery, among the herd of all the others who have similar appetites, to get back into the front row, and finally—even at the expense of their most sacred convictions—to regale themselves anew at that beloved spot where they find their fodder. They are the jackals of politics. A Weltanschauung will never of itself willingly give ground to another. Therefore it can never agree to collaborate in any order of things that it condemns. On the contrary, it feels obliged to employ every available means in the fight against the old order and the whole world of ideas belonging to that order and to prepare the way for its destruction.*

*The individual soldier is not initiated into the secrets of high strategical plans, but he is trained to submit to a rigid discipline, to be passionately convinced of the justice and inner might of his cause and to devote himself to it without reserve. So, too, the individual follower of a movement must be made acquainted with its far-reaching purpose, and realise that it is inspired by a powerful will and that it has a great future before it. Supposing that each soldier in an army were a general, if only as regards his training and capacity, that army would not be an efficient fighting instrument. Similarly, a political movement would not be very efficient in fighting for a Weltanschauung if it were made up exclusively of intellectuals. We need the private soldier too. Without him no discipline can be established. By its very nature, an organisation can exist only if leaders of high intellectual ability are served by a large mass of men who are emotionally devoted to the cause. To maintain discipline in a company of two hundred men who are equally intelligent and capable would turn out more difficult in the, long run than to maintain discipline in a company of one hundred and ninety less gifted men and ten who have had a higher education. The Social Democrats have profited by recognising this truth. They took the broad masses of our people who had just completed military service and learned to submit to discipline, and they subjected this mass of men to the discipline of the Social Democratic organisation, which was no less rigid than the discipline through which the young men had passed in the course of their military training. The Social Democratic organisation consisted of an army divided into officers and men. The German worker who had completed his military service became the private soldier in that army, and the Jewish intelligentsia were its officers. The German tradeunion functionaries may be compared to its non-commissioned officers. The fact, which was always looked upon with dismay by our middle classes, that only the socalled uneducated classes joined the Marxists was the very ground on which this party achieved its success. For while the bourgeois parties—because they consisted mostly of intellectuals, were only a feckless band of undisciplined individuals—the Marxist leaders have formed out of much less intelligent human material an army of party combatants who obey their Jewish masters just as blindly as they formerly obeyed their German officers.*

*If the idea of the völkisch State, which is at present an obscure ideal, is one day to attain a clear and definite success, from its vague and vast mass of thought it will have to put forward certain definite principles which of their very nature and content are calculated to attract a broad mass of adherents. In other words, such a group of people as can guarantee that these principles will be fought for. That group of people is the German working-class. That is why the programme of the new Movement was condensed into a few fundamental postulates, twenty-five in all. They are meant first of all to give the ordinary man a rough idea of what the Movement is aiming at. They are, so to speak, a profession of faith which, on the one hand, is meant to win adherents for the Movement and, on the other, they are meant to unite such adherents together in a covenant to which all have subscribed.*

In this connection we must never lose sight of the following fact: What we call the programme of the Movement is absolutely right as far as its ultimate aims are concerned, but as regards the manner in which that programme is formulated certain psychological considerations had to be taken into account.*  

- Page 507 (location ~ 7772-7781)    

*They are the basis of our propaganda. In order to carry the völkisch ideal to victory, a popular party had to be founded, a party that did not consist of intellectual leaders only, but also of manual labourers. Any attempt to carry these theories into effect without the aid of a militant organisation would be doomed to failure to-day, as it has failed in the past and must fail in the future. That is why it is not only the right, but also the duty, of the Movement to consider itself as the champion and representative of these ideas. Just as the fundamental principles of the National Socialist Movement are based on the völkisch idea, völkisch ideas are National Socialist. If National Socialism would triumph it will have to hold firm to this fact unreservedly, and here again it is not only its right, but also its duty, to emphasise most rigidly that any attempt to represent the völkisch idea outside of the National Socialist German Labour Party is futile and, in most cases, even fraudulent. If the reproach should be raised against our Movement that it has ‘monopolised’ the völkisch idea, there is only one answer to give. Not only have we monopolised the völkisch idea but, to all practical intents and purposes, we have created it, for what hitherto existed under this name was not in the least capable of influencing the destiny of our people, since all those ideas lacked a political and coherent formulation.*

*Just as heretofore they exploited everything to serve their petty electoral purposes, to-day they use the word völkisch only as an external and hollow-sounding phrase for the purpose of counteracting the force of the impression which the National Socialist Party makes on the members of the other parties. Only the desire to maintain their existence and the fear that our Movement may prevail, because it is based on a Weltanschauung that is of universal importance, and because they feel that the exclusive character of our movement betokens danger for them only for these reasons do they use words which they repudiated eight years ago, derided seven years ago, branded as stupid six years ago, combated five years ago, hated four years ago, derided three years ago and finally, two years ago, annexed and incorporated in their present political vocabulary, employing them as slogans in their struggle. For this reason, it is necessary even now, not to cease to call attention to the fact that not one of those parties has the slightest idea of what the German nation needs. The most striking proof of this is provided by the superficial way in which they use the word völkisch. Not less dangerous are those who run about as pseudo-adherents of the völkisch ideal formulating fantastic schemes which are mostly based on nothing else than a fixed idea which, in itself, might be right. But because it is an isolated notion, is of no use whatsoever for the formation of a great homogeneous fighting association and could by no means serve as the basis of its organisation. Those people who concoct a programme which consists partly of their own ideas and partly of ideas filched from others, about which they have read somewhere, are often more dangerous than the outspoken enemies of the völkisch idea.*  

- Page 512 (location ~ 7844-7857)    

*Above all, our Party has, by the success of its propaganda, shown the force of the völkisch idea—so much so that the others, in an effort to gain proselytes, find themselves forced to copy our example, at least in words. Just as heretofore they exploited everything to serve their petty electoral purposes, to-day they use the word völkisch only as an external and hollow-sounding phrase for the purpose of counteracting the force of the impression which the National Socialist Party makes on the members of the other parties.

At best they are sterile theorists, but more frequently they are mischievous agitators. They believe that they can mask their intellectual vanity, the futility of their efforts and their lack of ability, by sporting flowing beards and indulging in ancient Germanic gestures.*

*As for myself, I then saw clearly that for the small group which first composed our Movement the question of war-guilt had to be cleared up, and cleared up in the light of historical truth. A preliminary condition for the future success of our Movement was that it should bring knowledge of the meaning of the peace treaties to the minds of the masses. In the opinion of the masses, the peace treaties then signified a democratic success. Therefore, it was necessary to take the opposite side and impress ourselves on the minds of the people as the enemies of the peace treaties, so that later on, when the naked truth of this despicable swindle should be disclosed in all its hideousness, the people would recall the attitude which we then took up and would give us their confidence. Even at that time I adopted the attitude that if public opinion went astray on important and fundamental questions, it was necessary to oppose it, regardless of popularity, hatred or the bitterness of the fight. The National Socialist German Labour Party ought not to be the servant, but rather the master, of public opinion. It must not serve the masses, but dominate them.*

*While the international Jew is slowly but surely strangling us, our socalled patriots vociferate against a man and his system which have had the courage to liberate themselves from the shackles of Jewish freemasonry, at least in one quarter of the globe, and to set the forces of national resistance against the international world poison. But weak characters were tempted to set their sails according to the direction of the wind and to capitulate before the storm of public opinion—for it was truly a capitulation. Even if people are so much in the habit of lying and so morally base that they do not admit it even to themselves, the truth remains that only cowardice and fear of the public feeling aroused by the Jews induced certain people to join in the hue and cry. All the other reasons put forward were only the miserable excuses of paltry culprits who were conscious of their own crime. Then it was necessary to grasp the rudder with an iron hand and turn the Movement about, so as to save it from a course that would have set it on the rocks.*  

- Page 516 (location ~ 7907-7914)    

*In this connection it may be asserted that the greatest and most enduring successes in history are mostly those which were least understood at the beginning, because they were in direct opposition to public opinion and the views and wishes of the time. We had experience of this when we made our own first public appearance. It can be said in all truth that we did not court public favour, but made an onslaught on the follies of our people. In those days what happened almost always was that I presented myself before an assembly of men who believed the opposite of what I wished to say and who wanted the opposite of what I believed in. Then I had to spend a couple of hours in convincing two or three thousand people that the opinions they had hitherto held were false, in destroying the foundations of their views with one blow after another and finally in persuading them to take their stand on the grounds of our own convictions and our Weltanschauung. I learned something that was important at that time, namely, to snatch from the hands of the enemy the weapons which he was using in his reply. I soon noticed that our adversaries, especially in the persons of those who led the discussion against us, were furnished with a definite repertoire of arguments out of which they took points against bur claims which they were constantly repeating.*  

- Page 517 (location ~ 7920-7930)    

*Two years later I was master of this art. In every speech which I made it was important to get a clear idea beforehand of the probable form and matter of the counter-arguments we had to expect in the discussion, so that in the course of my own speech these could be dealt with and refuted. To this end it was necessary to mention all the possible objections and show their inconsistency; it was all the easier to win over an honest listener by expunging from his memory the arguments which had been impressed upon it, so that, I anticipated his replies. What he had learned was refuted without having been mentioned by him and that made him all the more attentive to what I had to say. That was the reason why, after my first lecture on ‘The Peace Treaty of Versailles,’ which I delivered to the troops while I was still a political instructor in my regiment, I made an alteration in the title and subject and henceforth spoke on, ‘The Treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Versailles.’ I did so because, during the discussion which followed my first lecture, I quickly ascertained that in reality people knew nothing about the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and that able party propaganda had succeeded in presenting that treaty as one of the most scandalous acts of violence in the history of the world. As a result of the persistency with which this falsehood was repeated again and again to the masses of the people, millions of Germans saw in the Treaty of Versailles a just retribution for the crime we had committed at Brest-Litovsk. Thus they considered all opposition to Versailles as unjust and in many cases there was an honest moral dislike of such a proceeding. This was also the reason why the shameless and monstrous word ‘reparations’ came into common use in Germany. This hypocritical falsehood appeared to millions of our exasperated fellow-countrymen as the merit of a higher justice. It is a terrible thought, but the fact was so. The best proof of this was the propaganda which I initiated against Versailles by explaining the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. I compared the two treaties, point by point, and showed how in truth the one treaty was immensely humane, in contradiction to the inhuman barbarity of the other. The effect was very striking. When I used to speak on this theme before an assembly of two thousand persons, I often saw three thousand six hundred hostile eyes fixed on me, yet three hours later I had in front of me a crowd swayed by righteous indignation and fury. A great lie had been uprooted from the hearts and brains of thousands of individuals and a truth had been implanted in its place.*

*Our first meetings were distinguished by the fact that there were tables covered with leaflets, papers, and pamphlets of every kind, but we relied principally on the spoken word. And, indeed this is the only means capable of producing really great revolutions, which fact can be explained on general psychological grounds. In the first volume I have already stated that all the formidable events which have changed the aspect of the world were carried through, not by the written, but by the spoken word. On that point there was a long discussion in a certain section of the press, during the course of which our shrewd bourgeois people strongly opposed my thesis, but the reason for this attitude confounded the sceptics. The bourgeois intelligentsia protested against my attitude simply because they themselves did not have either the force or the ability to influence the masses through the spoken word, for they always relied exclusively on the help of writers and did not enter the arena themselves as orators for the purpose of arousing the people. This habit necessarily led to that condition of affairs which is characteristic of the bourgeoisie to-day, namely, the loss of the psychological instinct to work up and influence the masses.*

*The deluge of papers and books published by intellectual circles year after year passed over the minds of millions of the lower social strata as water runs off a duck’s back. This proves that one of two things must be true: either that the matter offered in the bourgeois press was worthless or that it is impossible to reach the hearts of the broad masses by means of the written word alone. Of course, the latter is essentially true when the written material betrays as little psychological insight as hitherto. It is useless to object here, as certain big Berlin papers of German Nationalist tendencies have attempted to do, that this statement is refuted by the fact that the Marxists have exercised their greatest influence through their writings and especially through their principal book, published by Karl Marx. Seldom has a more superficial attempt been made to support an argument based on a false assumption. What gave Marxism its amazing influence over the broad masses was not that formal printed work which sets forth the Jewish system of ideas, but the tremendous oral propaganda carried on for years among the masses. Out of one hundred thousand German workers scarcely one hundred know Marx’s book. It has been studied much more in intellectual circles and especially by the Jews than by the genuine followers of the movement who come from the lower classes.*

What differentiates the bourgeois press from the Marxist press is that the latter is written by agitators, whereas the bourgeois press would like to carry on agitation by means of professional writers. The Social Democratic editor of some local ‘rag’, who almost always comes directly from the meeting to the editorial offices of his paper, knows his job to his finger-tips, but the bourgeois scribbler who wishes to appeal to the broad masses, feels faint if their stench but reach his delicate nostrils and so he is naturally powerless to touch them by his writings.*

*The same speech, made by the same orator and on the same theme, will have very different results according as it is delivered at ten o’clock in the forenoon, at three in the afternoon, or in the evening. When I first engaged in public speaking I arranged for meetings to take place in the forenoon and I remember particularly a demonstration that we held in the Münchner-Kindl-Keller as a protest against the oppression of German minorities. That was the biggest hall then in Munich and the risk appeared very great. In order to make the hour of the meeting suitable for all the members of our Movement and the other people who might come, I fixed it for ten o’clock on a Sunday morning. The result was depressing, but it was very instructive. The hall was filled. The impression was profound, but the general atmosphere was chilly. Nobody got warmed up and I myself, as the speaker of the occasion, felt profoundly unhappy at the thought that I could not establish the slightest contact with my audience. I do not think I spoke worse than on other occasions, but the effect seemed absolutely negative. I left the hall in a very depressed frame of mind, but also feeling that I had gained a new experience. Later on I tried the same kind of experiment, but always with the same results. That was not to be wondered at. If one goes to a theatre to see a matinee performance and, then attends an evening performance of the same play, one is astounded at the difference in the impression created.*

The superior oratorical art of a man who has the compelling character of an apostle will succeed better in bringing round to a new way of thinking those who have, in the course of nature, been subjected to a weakening of their forces of resistance rather than in converting those who are in full possession of their volitional and intellectual faculties. The mysterious artificial dimness of the Catholic churches, the burning candles, the incense, the thurible, etc. also serve this purpose.

The same is true of the greatest revolutionary movement of our own day, namely, the Bolshevist Revolution in Russia, which was not the outcome of Lenin’s writings, but of the oratorical activities of innumerable agitators, great and small, who stirred up hatred. The masses of illiterate Russians were not fired to communist revolutionary enthusiasm by reading the theories of Karl Marx, but by the promises of paradise made to the people by thousands of agitators in the service of a single idea. It has always been so, and it always will be so.*

*In the morning and during the day it seems that the rower of the human will rebels most strongly against any attempt to impose upon it the will or opinion of another. On the other hand, in the evening it easily succumbs to the domination of a stronger will, because actually in such assemblies there is a contest between two opposing forces. The superior oratorical art of a man who has the compelling character of an apostle will succeed better in bringing round to a new way of thinking those who have, in the course of nature, been subjected to a weakening of their forces of resistance rather than in converting those who are in full possession of their volitional and intellectual faculties. The mysterious artificial dimness of the Catholic churches, the burning candles, the incense, the thurible, etc. also serve this purpose. In this struggle between the orator and the opponent whom he must convert to his cause, the former gradually acquires an awareness of the psychological fitness of his propaganda weapons, which the writer seldom possesses. Generally speaking, the effect of the writer’s work helps rather to conserve, reinforce and deepen the foundations of opinions already formed. All really great historical revolutions were not produced by the written word; at most, they were accompanied by it. It is out of the question to think that the French Revolution could have been carried into effect by philosophising theories had it not been for an army of agitators headed by demagogues of a pronounced type who inflamed popular passion that had been already aroused, until that volcanic eruption finally broke out which convulsed the whole of Europe.

It has always been so, and it always will be so. It is typical of our pig-headed intellectuals, who live apart from the practical world, to think that a writer must of necessity be superior in intelligence to an orator. This point of view was once effectively illustrated by a critique, published in a certain national paper which I have already mentioned, where it was stated that one is often disillusioned by reading the speech of an acknowledged great orator in print.*

*another article which fell into my hands during the War. It dealt with the speeches of Lloyd George, who was then Minister of Munitions, and examined them in a painstaking way under the microscope of criticism. The writer made the brilliant statement that these speeches showed inferior intelligence and learning and that, moreover, they were banal and commonplace productions. I happened to get hold of some of these speeches, published in pamphlet form, and had to laugh at the fact that an ordinary German quill-driver did not in the least understand these psychological masterpieces in the art of influencing the masses. This man criticised these speeches solely according to the impression they made on his own arrogant mind, whereas the one aim of the great British demagogue was to produce the maximum effect upon his audiences and, in the widest sense, on the lower classes throughout the length and breadth of, Britain. Looked at from this point of view, that British statesman’s speeches were most wonderful achievements, precisely because they showed an astounding knowledge of the mentality of the broad masses of the people. For that reason their effect was really overwhelming.*

*Mass meetings are also necessary for the reason that, in attending them, the individual who, about to join the new movement, feels himself alone and is easily scared of acting singularly acquires for the first time the feeling of a great community, which has a strengthening and encouraging effect on most people. The same man will, as a member of a company or battalion, surrounded by his companions, march with a lighter heart to the attack than if he had to march alone. In the crowd he feels himself in some way sheltered, though in reality there are a thousand arguments against such a feeling. Mass demonstrations on a grand scale not only reinforce the will of the individual, but they draw him still closer to the movement and help to create an esprit de corps. The man who appears as the first representative of a new doctrine in his place of business or in his factory is bound to have to face obstacles and has need of that strength which comes from the consciousness that he is a member of a great community, and only a mass demonstration can impress upon him the greatness of this community. If, on leaving the shop or mammoth factory, in which he feels very small indeed, he enters a cast assembly for the first time and sees around him thousands upon thousands of men who hold the same opinions;*

*The will, the yearning and indeed the strength of thousands of people are in each individual. A man who enters such a meeting in doubt and hesitation leaves it inwardly fortified; he has become a member of a community. The National Socialist Movement should never forget this, and it should never allow itself to be influenced by those bourgeois blockhead, who think they know everything, but who have foolishly gambled away a great State, together with their own existence and the supremacy of their own class. They are extraordinarily clever, they can do everything, and they know everything, but there was one thing which they failed to do, namely, to save the German people from falling into the clutches of Marxism. In that they failed miserably and their present high opinion of their prowess is mere conceit, for their pride and their stupidity are fruits of the same tree.*

*I came to know the prophets of the bourgeois Weltanschauung, and I was not surprised at what I learned, as I knew that they attached little importance to the spoken word. At that time, I attended meetings of the Democrats, the German Nationalists, the German People’s Party and the Bavarian People’s Party (the Centre Party of Bavaria). What struck me at once was the homogeneous uniformity of the audiences. Nearly always they were made up exclusively of party members. The whole affair was more like a yawning card party than an assembly of people who had just passed through a great revolution. The speakers did all they could to maintain this tranquil atmosphere. They declaimed, or rather read out, their speeches in the style of an intellectual newspaper article or a learned treatise, avoiding all forcible expressions. Here and there a feeble professorial joke would be introduced, whereupon the people sitting at the speaker’s table felt themselves obliged to laugh—not loudly or infectiously, but with well-bred reserve. Oh, those people at the speaker’s table! I once attended a meeting in the Wagner Hall in Munich. It was a demonstration to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig. The speech was delivered, or rather read out, by a venerable old professor from one or other of the universities.*

*It was whispered in German Nationalist circles that we also were merely another variety of Marxists, perhaps even Marxists suitably disguised, or better still, Socialists. The actual difference between Socialism and Marxism still remains a mystery to these people to this day. The charge of Marxism was conclusively proved when it was discovered that at our meetings we deliberately substituted the word ‘compatriots’ for ‘Ladies and Gentlemen’ and addressed each other as ‘Party Comrade.’ We used to roar with laughter at these silly faint-hearted bourgeois and their efforts to puzzle out our origin, our intentions and our aims. We chose red for our posters after careful deliberation, our intention being to irritate the Left, so as to arouse their attention and tempt them to come to our meetings—if only in order to break them up—so that it this way we might have a chance of talking to the people.*

*This state of affairs compelled us to take the work of safeguarding our meetings into our own hands. No reliance could be placed on the protection of the authorities, on the contrary, experience showed that it was the disturbing element which gained by such intervention. The only real outcome of police intervention was that the meeting would be dissolved, which was precisely what our opponents wanted. Generally speaking, this led the police to adopt a method of procedure which, to say the least of it, was a most infamous example of official malpractice. The moment they received information of a threat that some meeting was to be broken up, instead of arresting the would-be disturbers, they promptly forbade the non-guilty party to hold the meeting, this being a measure which appealed to the average police mentality as the climax of wisdom. This step the police proclaimed to be a ‘precautionary measure in the interests of law and order.’ The political work and activities of decent people could, therefore, always be hindered by any desperate ruffians who had the means at their disposal. In the name of law and order State authority bowed down to these ruffians and demanded that others should not provoke them. When the National Socialists desired to hold meetings in certain places and the tradeunions declared that their members would resist, then it was not the blackmailers that were arrested and gaoled. On the contrary, our meetings were forbidden by the police. In fact, the strong arm of the law had the unspeakable impudence to advise us in writing to this effect on innumerable occasions.*

On the contrary, our meetings were forbidden by the police. In fact, the strong arm of the law had the unspeakable impudence to advise us in writing to this effect on innumerable occasions. To avoid such eventualities it was necessary to see to it that every attempt to disturb a meeting was nipped in the bud. Another feature to be taken into account in this respect is that all meetings which rely on police protection must necessarily bring discredit to their promoters in the eyes of the general public. Meetings that can be held only with the protective assistance of a strong force of police convert nobody, because in order to win over the lower strata of the people there must be a visible show of strength on one’s own side. In the same way that a man of courage will win a woman’s affection more easily than a coward, so a fearless movement will be more successful in winning the hearts of a people than a weak movement which relies on police support for its very existence. It is for this latter reason in particular that our young Party had to assume the full responsibility of safeguarding its own existence, defending itself and foiling the terrorist tactics of its opponents. The measures adopted for the protection of our meetings were as follows: Firstly, energetic and judicious conduct of the meeting. Secondly, the organisation of a squad of men to maintain order. In those days, we and no one else were masters of the situation at our meetings, and on no occasion did we fail to emphasise this. Our opponents fully realised that any provocation would be a signal to have them thrown out of the hall at once whatever the odds against us. At meetings, particularly outside Munich, we had in those days from five to eight hundred opponents to fifteen or sixteen National Socialists; yet we brooked no interference for our opponents knew full well that we were prepared to die rather than capitulate.*

*When our political meetings first started I made it a special point to organise a suitable defensive squad composed, as a matter of principle, solely of young men. Some of them were ex-service men who had seen active service with me. Others were young party members who, right from the start, had been trained to realise that terrorism can be combated only by terrorism, that only courageous and determined people had made a success of things in this world. Finally, they knew that we were fighting for an ideal so lofty that, it was worth the last drop of our blood. These young men had been trained to realise that where force replaced common sense in the solution of a problem, the best means of defence was attack and that the reputation of our hall-guard squads should stamp us as a political fighting force and not as a debating society. It was extraordinary how eagerly those boys of the war-generation responded to this order. They had indeed good reason to be bitterly disappointed and indignant at the miserable milksop methods employed by the bourgeoisie. Thus it became clear to everyone that the Revolution had only been possible thanks to the dastardly methods of a bourgeois government. At that time there was certainly no lack of man-power to suppress the revolution, but unfortunately there was an entire lack of an organising brain.*

How often did the eyes of my young men light up with enthusiasm when I explained to them the vital functions connected with their task. I assured them time and again that all earthly wisdom is useless unless it be supported and protected by force; that the gentle goddess of Peace can only walk in company with the god of War; and that every great measure performed in the name of Peace must be protected and furthered by means of force.*

*All honour to those young men for the way in which they performed their duty! Like a swarm of hornets they tackled disturbers at our meetings, regardless of superiority of numbers, however great, indifferent to wounds and bloodshed, inspired with the great idea of blazing a trail for the sacred mission of our Movement. As early as the summer of 1920 the organisation of squads of men as hall-guards for the purpose of maintaining order at our meetings was gradually assuming definite shape. By the spring of 1921 this body of men was sectioned off into squads of one hundred which, in turn, were subdivided into smaller groups. The urgency for this was apparent, as meanwhile the number of our meetings had steadily increased. We still frequently met in the Munich Hofbräuhaus, but more frequently in larger meeting halls throughout the city. In the autumn and winter of 1920–our meetings in the Burgerbrau and Münchener-Kindl-Keller had assumed vast proportions and the same thing always happened, namely, that the National Socialist German Labour Party meetings were always crowded out so that the police were compelled to close and bar the doors long before the proceedings commenced.*

*Only in one part of the German-speaking territory in German Austria was there anything like a bourgeois party flag in existence. Here a section of the national bourgeoisie selected the 1848 colours (black, red and gold) as their party flag and then they created a symbol which, though of no significance from the point of view of a Weltanschauung, had, nevertheless, a revolutionary character from a national political point of view. The most bitter opponents of this flag at that time (and this should not be forgotten to-day) were the Social Democrats and the Christian Socialists or the clergy. They it was, in particular, who degraded and besmirched these colours just as in 1918 they dragged black, white and red in the gutter. Of course, the black, red and gold of the German parties in the old Austria were the colours of the year 1848; that is to say, of a period likely to be regarded as somewhat visionary, but it was a period that had honest Germans as its representatives, although the Jews were lurking unseen as wire-pullers in the background. It was the act of high treason and the shameful bartering of the German people and German territory that first of all made these colours so attractive to the Marxists and the Centre Party; so much so, that to-day they revere them as their most cherished possession and found their own associations for the protection of the flag they once foully besmirched. It is a fact, therefore, that, up to 1920, there was no flag that could have stood for a Weltanschauung diametrically opposed to Marxism. For even if the better political elements among the German bourgeoisie were loath to accept the suddenly discovered black, red and gold colours as their symbol after the year 1918, they were nevertheless incapable of countering this with a programme of their own for the future. At last, they had a reconstruction of the old Reich in mind. It is to this way of thinking that the black, white and red colours of the old Reich are indebted for their resurrection as the flag of our socalled national bourgeois parties.*

*In hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first thing to awaken interest in a movement. For this reason we declined all suggestions from various quarters for the identification of our Movement, by means of a white flag, with the old State or rather with those decrepit parties whose sole political objective was the restoration of past conditions. Apart from this, white is not a colour capable of attracting and focussing public attention. It is a colour suitable only for temperance associations and not for a movement that stands for reform in a revolutionary period. Black was also suggested—certainly well-suited to the times, but embodying no significance expressive of the will behind our Movement. Moreover, black is incapable of attracting attention. White and blue were discarded, despite their admirable aesthetic appeal as being the colours of an individual German federal state—a state that, unfortunately, through its political attitude of particularist narrow-mindedness did not enjoy a good reputation. In addition, with these colours it would have been difficult to attract attention to our Movement. The same applies to black and white. Black, red and gold did not come into consideration; neither, for the reasons already mentioned, did black, white and red—at least not in the form hitherto in use. But the effectiveness of these three colours is far superior to all others and they are certainly the most strikingly harmonious combination. I myself was always for keeping the old colours, not only because I, as a soldier, regarded them as my most sacred possession, but because in their aesthetic effect they are, more than any others, symbolic of my personal sentiments. Accordingly, I had to discard all the innumerable suggestions and designs which had been proposed for the new Movement, among which were many that had incorporated the swastika in a design with the old colours. I, as leader, was unwilling to make public my own design, as it was possible that someone else would come forward with a design just as good, if not better, than my own. As a matter of fact, a dental surgeon from Starnberg submitted a good design very similar to mine, with only one mistake, namely, that upon a white ground he set a swastika with curved limbs. After innumerable trials I decided upon a final form—a flag of red material with a white disc bearing in its centre a black swastika. After many attempts I obtained the correct proportions between the dimensions of the flag and that of the white central disc, as well as of the swastika. This design was finally adopted. At the same time, we immediately ordered corresponding armlets for our squad of men who kept order at meetings, armlets of red material bearing a white disc with the black swastika upon it. A party badge was designed on the same lines, namely, a white disc on a red ground bearing the swastika in the centre. Herr Fuss, a Munich goldsmith, supplied the first practical and permanent design for this. The new flag made its first appearance in public in the summer of 1920. It suited out Movement admirably, both being new and young. Not a soul had seen this flag before and its effect at that time was something akin to that of a flaming torch. We ourselves experienced almost a boyish thrill when one of the women-members of the Party who had been entrusted with the making of the flag finally handed it over to us.*

*After the first hour the speech was already being received by spontaneous outbursts of applause, but after the second hour this died down to a solemn stillness which I was to experience so often later on in this same hall and which will be forever remembered by all those present. Nothing broke, this impressive silence and only when the last word had been spoken did the meeting give vent to its feelings by singing the national anthem. I watched the scene during the next twenty minutes, as the vast hall slowly emptied itself, and only then did I leave the platform, a happy man, and make my way home. Photographs were taken of this first meeting in the Circus Krone in Munich. They are more eloquent than words in demonstrating the success of this meeting. The bourgeois papers reproduced photographs and reported the meeting as having been merely ‘nationalist’ in character-in their usual modest fashion they omitted all mention of its promoters. Thus we had, for the first time, far exceeded the limits of an ordinary party. We could now no longer be ignored, and to dispel all doubt that the meeting was merely an isolated success, I immediately arranged for another at the Circus Krone in the following week, with the same results. Once more the vast hall was filled to overflowing; so much so that I decided to hold a third meeting in the same hall during the following week, and yet a third time the immense building was filled with people.*  

- Page 554 (location ~ 8483-8493)    

*Finally, we did not believe that the Hofbräuhaus in Munich was suitable for the interruptive tactics of our adversaries. We had feared such a thing far more in the bigger halls, especially in the Circus Krone, but on this point we were to learn a very serviceable lesson on that evening. Later, we studied this whole question scientifically and arrived at conclusions, both interesting and incredible, which were afterwards of fundamental importance in determining the organisation and tactics of our Storm Troops. When I arrived at the entrance hall of the Hofbräuhaus at 7:45 p.m. that evening, I realised that there could be no doubt as to what the Reds intended. The hall was filled, and for that reason the police had barred the entrances. Our adversaries, who had arrived very early, were in the hall, and our followers were, for the most part, outside. The small bodyguard of S.A. men awaited me at the entrance. I had the doors leading to the principal hall closed and then asked the bodyguard of forty-five or forty-six men to come forward. I made it clear to them that perhaps on that evening they would for the first time have to show their unbending and unbreakable loyalty to the Movement and that not one of us must leave the hall unless he were carried out dead. I added that I would remain in the hall and that I did not believe that one of them would abandon me, and that if I saw any one of them act the coward I myself would personally tear off his armlet and his badge. I demanded of them that they should come forward if the slightest attempt were made to sabotage the meeting and that they must remember that the best defence is always attack. I was answered with a triple ‘Heil’ which sounded more hoarse and enthusiastic than usual. Then I advanced through the hall and could take in the situation with my own eyes. Our opponents sat close together and tried to pierce me with their looks. Innumerable pairs of eyes glowing with hatred and rage were fixed on me, while others with sneering faces greeted me with shouts and threats to the effect that they would ‘settle our hash’, that we should ‘look out for ourselves’ and that they would ‘stop our mouths once and for all’, along with other expressions of an equally elegant character.*  

- Page 556 (location ~ 8521-8538)    

*The natural course of things would now be that all those who wish to fight for the same objective as this movement is striving for, should identify themselves with it and thus increase its strength, so that the common purpose in view may be the better served. Especially men of superior intelligence must feel, one and all, that by joining the movement they are establishing precisely those conditions which are necessary for practical success in the common struggle. Accordingly it is reasonable and, in a certain sense, honest—which honesty, as I shall show later, is an element of very great importance—that only one movement should be founded for the purpose of attaining one aim. The fact that this does not happen must be attributed to two causes. The first may almost be described as tragic; the second as despicable, because it has its source in the weaknesses of human nature. But, when all is said and done, I see in both causes only facts which go to strengthen our determination and our energy and which, by this intensification of human activity render possible the solution of the problem in question. The tragic reason why it so often happens that the pursuit of one definite task is not left to one association alone is as follows: Generally speaking, every action carried out on a grand scale is the expression of a desire that has already existed for a long time in millions of human hearts, a longing which may have been nourished, in silence.*  

- Page 561 (location ~ 8592-8602)    

*An essential characteristic of what are called the great questions of the age is that thousands undertake the task of solving them and that many feel themselves called upon to fulfil this task; it may even be that Destiny herself puts forward many for selection, in order that, through the free play of events the strongest and most capable man shall ultimately be the victor and be entrusted with the task of solving the problem. Thus it may happen that for centuries many are discontent with the form in which their religious life expresses itself and yearn for a reformation. So it may come about that through this impulse of the soul some dozens of men may arise who believe that, by virtue of their understanding and their knowledge, they are called upon to solve the religious difficulties of the day and accordingly present themselves as the prophets of a new doctrine or at least as declared adversaries of the accepted dogmas. Here also it is certain that the laws of Nature will take their course, inasmuch as the strongest will be destined to fulfil the great mission, but usually the others are slow to acknowledge that only one man is called upon to fulfil the task. On the contrary they all believe that they have an equal right to engage in the solution of the difficulties in question and that they are equally fitted for that task. Their contemporary world is generally quite unable to decide which of them possesses the highest gifts and accordingly merits universal support. Thus, in the course of centuries, and indeed often within the same epoch, different men establish different movements to achieve the same end.*  

- Page 562 (location ~ 8609-8621)    

*At least the end is declared by the founders of the movements to be the same, or may be looked upon as such by the bulk of the people. The people nourish vague desires and have only general opinions, without having any precise notion of their own ideals and desires or of the question whether and how it is possible for these ideals and desires to be fulfilled. The tragedy lies in the fact that many men struggle to reach the same objective by different roads, each one genuinely believing in his own mission and holding himself in duty bound to follow his own road without regard for the others. These movements, parties, religious groups, etc., originate entirely independently of one another out of the general urge of the age, and all with a view to working towards the same goal. It may seem a tragic thing, at least at first sight, that this should be so, because people are too often inclined to think that forces which are dispersed in different directions would attain their ends far more quickly and more surely if they were united in one common effort. This is, however, not so, for Nature herself decides according to the rules of her inexorable logic. She leaves these diverse groups to compete with one another and dispute the palm of victory in order, finally, to lead that movement to the final goal which has chosen the clearest, shortest and surest path. How can the world decide which path is right or wrong, if the available forces are note given free play, if the final decision is not taken out of the hands of men who are convinced of their own infallibility and left to the infallible test of established success which is always the final confirmation of the justice of a course of action.*  

- Page 563 (location ~ 8621-8634)    

*In reality there was only one dominant motive, namely, the personal ambition of the founders, who wished to play a part in which their own pigmy talents could contribute nothing except the grass effrontery of appropriating the ideas of others, a mode of conduct which in ordinary life is looked upon as thieving. At that time there was not an idea or concept launched by other people which these political kleptomaniacs did not seize upon at once for the purpose of applying it for their own ends. Those who did all this were the same people who subsequently, with tears in their eyes, profoundly deplored ‘ völkisch disintegration’ and spoke unceasingly about the ‘necessity for unity.’ In doing this they nurtured the secret hope that they might be able to cry down the others, who would tire of hearing these loud-mouthed accusations and would end up by abandoning in favour of the thieves, not only the ideas already stolen by the latter, but the movements which had been founded for the execution of these ideas. When that did not occur and the new enterprises, thanks to the poor mentality of their promoters, did not show, the favourable results which had been promised beforehand, then they became more modest in their pretensions and were happy if they could find refuge in one of the socalled ‘cooperative associations.’ At that period everything which could not stand on its own feet joined one of those cooperative associations, probably in the belief that eight cripples arm-in-arm equalled one gladiator. If among all these cripples there was one who was sound of limb he had to use all his strength to sustain the others and thus he himself was, in the long run, crippled. We ought to look upon the question of joining these cooperative associations as a tactical problem, but, in coming to a decision, we must never forget the fundamental principle that through the formation of a cooperative association, societies which are weak in themselves can never be made strong, whereas it can and does not infrequently happen that a strong society or party loses in strength by joining a coalition of weaker ones. It is a mistake to believe that a factor of strength will result from the coalition of weak groups, because experience shows that in any form and under any conditions the majority is representative of the stupid and cowardly elements. Hence, a multiplicity of societies or parties is, as soon as it comes under the control of a board of management consisting of several persons elected by the parties, the victim of weakness and cowardice.*

*It may happen that, from considerations of a purely tactical kind, the leaders of a movement which looks ahead will enter into a coalition with other, movements for the treatment of special questions and may also act in common with them, but this can be only for a short and limited period. Such a coalition must not be permanent, if the movement does not wish to renounce its liberating mission, because if it should become indissolubly tied up in such a combination it would lose the capacity and the right to allow its own forces to work freely in following out a natural development, in order to overcome rivals and attain its own objective. It must never be forgotten that nothing really great in this world has ever been achieved through coalitions, but that such achievements have always been due to the triumph of the individual. Successes achieved through coalitions, owing to the very nature of their source carry in them from the very start the germs of future disintegration and the possibility of losing what has already been achieved. The great revolutions which have taken place in human thought and have transformed the aspect of the world would have been inconceivable and impossible except as the titanic struggles waged by individual elements. They could never have been the work of coalitions. Above all things, the völkisch State will never be created by the compromising attitude of cooperative associations but only by the iron determination of a single movement which has struggled and triumphed over all the others.*

*Every national body is made up of three main classes. At one extreme we have the best of the people, taking the word ‘best’ as indicating those who are highly endowed with the civic virtues and are noted for their courage and their readiness to sacrifice their private interests. At the other extreme are the worst dregs of humanity, in whom vice and egotistic interests prevail. Between these two extremes stands the third class, which is made up of the broad middle stratum, which does not incorporate either radiant heroism or vulgar vice. Those eras which mark the rise of a State are characterized and indeed made possible only by the fact that they occur under the exclusive leadership of that section belonging to the best extreme of the population. Times of normal and steady development, or of stable conditions, owe their existence and outwardly visible characteristics to the preponderating influence of the middle stratum.*  

- Page 572 (location ~ 8762-8769)    

*In this stage the two extreme classes counterbalance each other, or in other words; they cancel each other. Times of national collapse are determined by the preponderating influence of the worst elements. It must be noted here, however, that the broad masses, which constitute what I have called the middle section, come forward and make their influence felt only when the two extreme sections are engaged in mutual strife, in case one of the extreme sections comes out victorious, the middle section will readily submit to its domination. If the best dominate, the broad masses will follow it. Should the worst extreme prove triumphant, then the middle section will at least offer no opposition to it, for the masses that constitute the middle stratum never fight their own battles. The bloodshed which continued for four and a half years during the War destroyed the inner equilibrium between these three sections in so far as it can be said (with all due respect for the sacrifices made by the middle section) that it nearly led to the best extreme being bled white, because the total amount of irreplaceable and heroic German lives lost during these four and a half years was really tremendous. Just think of the hundreds of thousands of instances when there was a call for volunteers for the front, volunteers for patrol duty, volunteer dispatch carriers, volunteers to go out and rig up a telephone, volunteers for bridge building, volunteers for the submarines, volunteers for the air service, volunteers for the storm battalions, and so on. During four and a half years, and on thousands of occasions, there was always the cry for volunteers and again for volunteers, and the result was always the same.*

Beardless young fellows or fully developed men, all filled with an ardent love for their country; urged on by their own courageous spirit or by a lofty sense of their duty—it was always such men who answered the call for volunteers. There were tens of thousands, indeed hundreds of thousands, of such cases, so that that kind of human material steadily grew scarcer and scarcer. Those who were not killed were either maimed on the field of battle or disappeared gradually owing to the steady decrease in the number of survivors.*

*The four hundred thousand who fell or were permanently maimed on the battlefields of Flanders were irreplaceable. Their loss was something far more than a numerical loss. With their death the scales, being too lightly weighted at the best end, tipped rapidly upwards and the vulgar, infamous and cowardly elements, in short, those who constituted the worst extreme of our population, weighed heavier in the balance than previously. In addition to this, for four and a half years, our best human material was being thinned to an exceptional degree on the battlefields, while the worst extreme surpassed itself in the art of self-preservation.*

*Volunteer corps were assembled and, although hating the Revolution, they set to work to defend and to establish it firmly. In doing this they acted in perfect good faith. The real organiser of the Revolution and the actual wire-puller behind it, the international Jew, had sized up the situation correctly. The German people were not yet ripe to be drawn into the bloody swamp of Bolshevism, as the Russian people had been drawn. That was because there was a closer racial unity between the intellectual classes in Germany and the manual workers, and also because, as was also the case in the other States in Western Europe, broadly speaking, most classes of the community had their quota of cultured persons, whereas this was not the case in Russia. In that country the intellectual classes were, for the most part, not of Russian nationality, or at least they did not have the racial characteristics of the Slav. The thin upper layer of intellectuals which then existed in Russia could be abolished at any time, because there was no intermediate stratum connecting it organically with the great mass of the people. There the mental and moral level of the great mass of the people was extremely low. In Russia, the moment the agitators were successful in inciting the broad masses of the people, who could neither read nor write, against the upper layer of intellectuals who were not in contact with the masses or permanently linked with them in any way, the fate of Russia was decided, the success of the Revolution assured. Thereupon the analphabetic Russian became the slave of his Jewish dictators who, on their side, were shrewd enough to name their dictatorship ‘the dictatorship of the people.’*

*There has always been one possible way, and one only, of making weak or wavering men, or even downright cowards, face their duty steadfastly and that is that the deserter be given to understand that his desertion will bring upon him just the very thing from which he is fleeing. At the front a man may die, but the deserter must die. Only this draconian threat against every attempt to desert the flag can have an intimidating effect, not merely on the individual, but also on the mass. Therein lay the meaning and purpose of the military penal code. It was a magnificent delusion, to believe that the great struggle for the life of a nation could be carried through if it were based solely on voluntary fidelity, arising from and sustained by the knowledge that such a struggle was necessary. The voluntary fulfilment of one’s duty is a motive that determines the actions of only the best men, but not of the average type of man. Hence, special laws are necessary, just as, for instance, the law against stealing, which was not made for men who are honest on principle, but for the weak and unstable elements. Such laws are meant to hinder the evil-doer by their deterrent effect and thus prevent a state of affairs from arising in which the honest man is considered stupid, and which would end in the belief that it is better to have a share in the robbery, than to stand by with empty hands or allow oneself to be robbed. It was a mistake to believe that in a struggle which, according to all human reckoning, might last for several years it would be possible to dispense with those expedients which the experience of hundreds and even of thousands of years had proved to be effective in making weak and unstable men face and fulfil their duty in difficult times and at moments of great nervous stress.*

For the voluntary war-hero it is, of course, not necessary to have the death-penalty in the military code, but it is necessary for the cowardly egotists who value their own lives above the existence of the community in the hour of national need. Such weak and characterless people can be deterred from surrendering to their cowardice only by the application of the heaviest penalties.*

*In such a movement there is no longer a climax of activity, but merely the broad masses of the middle stratum, that is to say, inertia. Recognising all this, even during the War, the Jews brought about the famous split in the Social Democratic Party. While the Social Democratic Party, conforming to the inertia of its mass following, hung like a leaden weight on the neck of the national defence, the actively radical elements were extracted from it and formed into a particularly efficient force for purposes of attack. The Independent Party and the Spartacist League were the storm-battalions of revolutionary Marxism. The objective assigned to them was to create a fait accompli, on the basis of which the masses of the Social Democratic Party could take their stand, having been prepared for this event long beforehand. The spineless bourgeoisie had been estimated at its just value by the Marxists and treated en canaille. Nobody bothered about it, knowing well that in their canine servility the representatives of an old and worn-out generation would not be able to offer any serious resistance. When the Revolution had succeeded and its engineers believed that the main pillars of the old State had been broken down, the Army returning from the front began to appear in the light of a sinister sphinx and thus made it necessary to slow down the natural course of the Revolution. The main body of the Social Democratic horde occupied the conquered positions, and the Independent and Spartacist storm-battalions were side-tracked. This was not, however, possible without a struggle.*

*The German political bourgeoisie achieved the high honour of being able to associate itself with the accursed Marxist leaders for the purpose of combating Bolshevism. Thus as early as December 1918 and January 1919 the situation was as follows: A minority consisting of the worst elements had engineered the Revolution, and behind this minority all the Marxist parties immediately fell into step. The Revolution itself had an outward appearance of moderation, which aroused the enmity of the fanatical extremists. These began to resort to the use of hand-grenades and machine-guns, occupying public buildings, and thus threatening to destroy the moderate trend of the Revolution. To prevent this terrorism from developing further a truce was concluded between the representatives of the new regime and the adherents of the old order, for the purpose of waging a common fight against the extremists. The result was that the enemies of the Republic ceased to oppose the Republic as such and helped to subjugate those who were also enemies of the Republic, though for quite different reasons, but a further consequence was that all danger of the adherents of the old State putting up a fight against the new was now definitely averted. This fact must always be borne in mind.*  

- Page 582 (location ~ 8917-8926)    

*As I have already pointed out, after the destruction of the old Army the revolutionary leaders were forced to strengthen the authority of the State by creating a new factor of power. In the conditions that existed they could do this only by winning over to their side the adherents of a Weltanschauung which was diametrically opposed to their own. From those elements alone was it possible slowly to create a new Army, limited numerically by the peace treaties, whose spirit had to undergo a transformation, before it could become an instrument of the new regime. If, setting aside the very real defects of the old State, which undoubtedly constituted a contributory factor, we ask ourselves how it was possible for the revolutionary action to succeed, we arrive at the following conclusions: Firstly, it was due to the petrifaction of our sense of duty and obedience. Secondly, it was due also to the passive timidity of the parties who were supposed to uphold the State. Moreover, it should be emphasised that the process of petrifaction of our sense of duty and obedience was fundamentally due to our wholly non-national and purely State education which resulted in a confusion of the conceptions ‘means’ and ‘ends.’ Consciousness of duty, fulfilment of duty and obedience, are not ends in themselves any more than the State is an end in itself, but they all ought to be employed as means to facilitate and assure the existence of a community of people who are physically and mentally akin. At a moment when a nation is manifestly collapsing and when all outward signs show that it is on the point of becoming the victim of ruthless oppression, thanks to the conduct of a few miscreants, to obey these people and fulfil one’s appointed task is merely doctrinaire formalism, and indeed pure folly. On the other hand, refusal to obey and to ‘fulfil one’s appointed task’ in such a case might save the nation from collapse.*

On the other hand, refusal to obey and to ‘fulfil one’s appointed task’ in such a case might save the nation from collapse. According to our current bourgeois idea of the State, a divisional general who received from his superior the order not to shoot fulfilled his duty and therefore acted rightly in not shooting, because, to the bourgeois mind blind obedience is more valuable than the life of a nation.*  

- Page 583 (location ~ 8936-8953)    

*Their political programme was grounded in the past, even though they themselves had become reconciled to the new regime. Their aim was to secure, if possible, a share in the new institution, and so they continued to use words as their sole weapon. Therefore, after the Revolution the bourgeois parties also capitulated to the mob in a miserable fashion. When the Law for the Protection of the Republic was introduced the majority was not at first in favour of it, but, confronted with two hundred thousand Marxists demonstrating in the streets, tine bourgeois ‘statesmen’ were so terror stricken that they voted for the law against their better judgment, for the edifying reason that they feared they might otherwise be beaten up by the enraged masses on leaving the Reichstag—something which unfortunately did not occur upon the law being passed. Thus, the new State developed along its own lines, as if there had been no national opposition at all.*  

- Page 586 (location ~ 8972-8979)    

*The success which Marxism had scored was due to perfect cooperation between political determination and ruthless force. What prevented nationalist Germany from taking a hand in shaping developments was the lack of determined cooperation between brute force and inspired political aims. Whatever may have been the aspirations of the ‘national’ parties, they had no force whatsoever to fight for these aspiration least of all in the streets. The power lay in the hands of the defence leagues. They were masters of the street and of the State, but they lacked political ideals and aims on behalf of which their forces could have been mobilised in the interests of the German nation. In both cases, the cunning Jew was able by his astute powers of persuasion, to make this unfortunate state of affairs permanent or at least to aggravate it. The Jew succeeded brilliantly in using his press for the purpose of spreading abroad the idea that the defence leagues were of a ‘non-political character,’ just as in politics he was always astute enough to praise the ‘purely intellectual’ character of the struggle and demand that it must always be kept on that plane. Millions of German imbeciles then repeated this folly, without having the slightest suspicion that by so doing, they were, to all practical purposes, disarming themselves and delivering themselves defenceless into the hands of the Jew. There is a natural explanation of this also. The lack of a great ideal capable of re-moulding conditions has always meant a limitation of fighting power. The conviction of the right to employ even the most brutal weapons is always associated with an ardent faith in the necessity for the triumph of a new and revolutionary order of things on this earth. A movement which does not fight for such high aims and ideals will never have recourse to extreme means. The appearance of a new and great ideal was the secret of the success of the French Revolution. The Russian Revolution owes its triumph to an ideal, and it was only the ideal that enabled Fascism to bestow on a whole nation the blessing of a complete reformation.*

*Bourgeois simpletons sitting on office stools in the various ministries babble about the necessity of not governing against the wishes of the workers and by the word ‘workers’ they mean the Marxists. By identifying the German worker with Marxism not only are they guilty of a vile distortion of the truth, but they are attempting to conceal the fact of their own collapse before the Marxist idea and the Marxist organisation. In view of the complete subordination of the present State to Marxism, the National Socialist Movement feels all the more bound, not only to prepare the way for the triumph of its ideal by appealing to the reason and understanding of the public, but also to take upon itself the responsibility of organising its own defence against the terrorism of the International, which is intoxicated with its own victory. I have already described how the practical experience gained by our young Movement led us slowly to organise a system of defence at our meetings. This gradually assumed the character of a military body specially trained for the maintenance of order and tended to develop into a service having its properly organised cadres.*  

- Page 589 (location ~ 9030-9038)    

*Political convictions in the higher sense mean that a man has a clear conception and profound understanding of the form of a new regime and feels that the establishment of this regime is an absolute necessity and one which he regards as the aim of his life’s work. The body of men organised for the preservation of order, which was then formed under the National Socialist Movement, was fundamentally different from all the other defence associations. This was by reason of the fact that our formations were not meant in any way to defend the state of things created by the Revolution, but rather that they were meant exclusively to support our struggle for the creation of a new Germany. In the beginning this body was merely a guard to maintain order at our meetings. Its first task was limited to making it possible for us to hold our meetings, which our opponents would otherwise have made completely unfeasible. These men were at that time trained to attack in blind obedience to orders but not, as was then pretended in stupid German patriotic circles, to revere the baton as the highest ideal, because they were aware that the highest ideals can be brought to naught if their champion is hit over the head with a club, since it has happened not infrequently in the course of history that great men have perished under the blows of the most insignificant helots. Our bodyguards did not look upon violence as an end in itself, but they protected the protagonists of ideal aims and purposes against hostile coercion by means of violence. They also understood that there was no obligation to undertake the defence of a State which did not guarantee the defence of the nation, but that, on the contrary, they had to defend the nation against those who were threatening to destroy nation and State. After the fight which took place at the meeting in the Münchener Hofbräuhaus, where the small number of our guards who were present won everlasting fame for themselves by the heroic manner in which they stormed their adversaries, these guards were called the Storm Detachment. As the name itself indicates, they represent only a detachment of the Movement. They form one constituent element of it, as do the press, the propaganda, scientific institutes or other sections of the Party.*  

- Page 590 (location ~ 9047-9064)    

*The bourgeois parties were happy to think that those whom they themselves could not oppose and to whom they had been forced to capitulate, could not be broken by us. What can be said for those State officials, chief of police, and even cabinet ministers, who showed a scandalous lack of principle in presenting themselves to the public as ‘nationalists’ and yet unashamedly played the part of henchmen to the Marxists in the disputes which we, the National Socialists, had with the latter? What can be said for persons who, for the sake of a little abject praise in the Jewish Press, debased themselves so far as to persecute those men to whose heroic courage and intervention, regardless of risk, they were partly indebted for not having been torn to pieces by the ‘Red’ mob a few years previously and strung up to the lamp-posts? One day these lamentable phenomena forced the late but unforgotten Prefect Pöhner (a man whose unflinching honesty forced him to hate all twisters and to hate them as only an honourable man can hate) to say, ‘All my life I wished to be first a German and then an official, and I never wanted to be taken for one of those creatures who, like prostitutes, sold themselves body and soul to anybody who could play lord and master for the time being.’ It was extremely sad that gradually tens of thousands of honest and loyal servants of the State did not only come under the power of such people, but were also slowly contaminated by their unprincipled morals. Moreover, men of this kind pursued honest officials with a furious hatred, hounding them out of their jobs, while passing themselves off as ‘nationalist’ with the aid of their lying hypocrisy.*  

- Page 592 (location ~ 9071-9084)    

*Even at that time my reasons for guarding strictly against allowing the Storm Detachment of the National Socialist German Labour Party, to be organised on the lines of a defence league were as follows: On purely practical grounds it is impossible to build up a national defence organisation by means of private associations, unless the State makes an enormous contribution to it. Whoever thinks otherwise overestimates his own powers. Now, it is entirely out of the question to form organisations of any military value for a definite purpose on the principle of socalled ‘voluntary discipline.’ Here the chief support for, the enforcement of orders, namely, the power to inflict punishment, is lacking. In the autumn, or rather in the spring, of it was still possible to raise socalled Freikorps, not only because most of the men who came forward at that time had been through the school of the old Army, but also because the kind of duty imposed there constrained the individual to absolute obedience, at least for a definite period of time. That spirit is entirely lacking in the volunteer defence organisations of to-day. The larger the defence league grows, the weaker its discipline becomes and so much less can be demanded of the individual members.*  

- Page 593 (location ~ 9090-9099)    

*There will always be very few men who will voluntarily and spontaneously submit to that kind of discipline which is considered natural and necessary in the Army. Moreover, a proper system of military training cannot be developed where the funds available are as ridiculously scanty as those at the disposal of the defence leagues. The principal task of such an institution must be to impart the best and most reliable kind of instruction. Eight years have passed since the end of the War, and during that time none of our German youth, at an age when formerly they would have had to do military service, have received any systematic training at all. The aim of a defence league cannot be to enlist all those who have already received a military training, since in that case it could be reckoned with mathematical accuracy when the last member would leave the league. Even the youngest soldier of 1918 will not be fit for front-line service twenty years later, and we are approaching that state of affairs with a rapidity that gives cause for anxiety.*  

- Page 594 (location ~ 9102-9110)    

*Is it not ridiculous to think of training some ten thousand men in the use of arms, and to carry on that training surreptitiously, when a few years previously the State, having shamefully sacrificed eight and a half million highly trained soldiers, not merely did not require their services any longer but, as a mark of gratitude for their faithful service, held them up to public contumely? Shall we train soldiers for a regime which besmirched and spat upon our most glorious soldiers, tore the medals and badges from their breasts, trampled on their flags and derided their achievements? Has the present regime taken one step towards restoring the honour of the old Army and making those who destroyed and outraged it answer for their deeds? Not in the least. On the contrary, the people I have just referred to may be seen enthroned in the highest governmental positions to-day, and yet it was said at Leipzig, ‘Right is might.’ Since, however, in our Republic to-day might is in the hands of the very men who started the Revolution, and since that Revolution represents a most despicable act of high treason against the nation yes the vilest act in German history—there can surely be no grounds for saying that the might of these men should be enhanced by the formation of a new young army. It is against all sound reason.*  

- Page 597 (location ~ 9139-9149)    

*History records but few examples of gratitude on the part of princes and only a patriot belonging to the new bourgeoisie would dream of counting on the gratitude of revolutionary incendiaries and assassins, who have enriched themselves by robbing the public and by betraying the nation. On examining the problem as to the wisdom of forming these defence leagues, I could not refrain from asking: ‘For whom shall I train these young men? For what purpose will they be employed and when are they to be called out?’ The answer to these questions provides the best rule for us to follow. If the present State should one day call upon trained troops of this kind it would never be for the purpose of defending the interests of the nation against the foreigner, but rather to protect the oppressors of the nation within the country against the danger of a general outbreak of wrath on the part of a nation which has been deceived and betrayed and whose interests have been bartered away. For this reason it was decided that the Storm Detachment of the National Socialist German Labour Party ought not to be in the nature of a military organisation. It had to be an instrument of protection and education for the National Socialist Movement and its duties lay in quite a different sphere to those of the military defence association. Moreover, the Storm Detachment was not to be in the nature of a secret organisation. Secret organisations are established only for purposes that are illegal, and the purpose of such an organisation is limited by its very nature. Considering the loquacious propensities of the German people, it is not possible to build up any vast organisation, at the same time keeping it secret or disguising its purpose. Every attempt of that kind is destined to turn out absolutely futile. It is not merely that our political officials to-day have at their disposal a staff of informers and other such rabble who are ready to play traitor, like Judas, for thirty pieces of silver and will betray whatever secrets they can discover and will invent what they do not know, for the sake of having something to reveal, but one’s own followers cannot be relied upon to maintain the silence necessary in such circumstances. Only small groups can become really secret societies, and that only after long years of selective elimination, but the very smallness of such groups would deprive them of all value for the National Socialist Movement. What we needed then, and need now, is not one or two hundred dare-devil conspirators, but hundreds of thousands of devoted champions of our Weltanschauung. The work must not be done through secret conventicles, but through impressive mass demonstrations in public. Dagger and pistol and poison-vial cannot clear the way for the progress of the Movement; that can be done only by winning over the man in the street. We must teach the Marxists that, in future, National Socialism will be master of the street, just as it will one day become master of the State. There is another danger connected with secret societies, It lies in the fact that their members often completely misunderstand the greatness of the task in hand and are apt to believe that the destiny of the nation can be assured overnight by the assassination of a, single man.*

Only small groups can become really secret societies, and that only after long years of selective elimination, but the very smallness of such groups would deprive them of all value for the National Socialist Movement. What we needed then, and need now, is not one or two hundred dare-devil conspirators, but hundreds of thousands of devoted champions of our Weltanschauung. The work must not be done through secret conventicles, but through impressive mass demonstrations in public. Dagger and pistol and poison-vial cannot clear the way for the progress of the Movement; that can be done only by winning over the man in the street. We must teach the Marxists that, in future, National Socialism will be master of the street, just as it will one day become master of the State. There is another danger connected with secret societies, It lies in the fact that their members often completely misunderstand the greatness of the task in hand and are apt to believe that the destiny of the nation can be assured overnight by the assassination of a, single man. Such a belief may find historical justification in cases where a nation had been suffering under the tyranny of some oppressor who at the same time was a man of genius and whose extraordinary personality was the sole guarantee for the continuance and frightfulness of his terrible oppression. In such cases a man may suddenly arise from the ranks of the people who is ready to sacrifice himself and plunge his deadly steel into the heart of the hated individual. In order to look upon such a deed with horror one must have the republican mentality of petty rogues conscious of their own crime, but Schiller, the greatest poet-champion of liberty that the German people have ever had, has glorified such a deed in his ‘Wilhelm Tell.’*

*There is yet another important question, namely, is some petty traitorous wretch to meet death at the bands of another petty traitor, or of an idealist? In the former case the result would be doubtful and the deed would almost surely be revealed later on. In the second case an unworthy rascal is put out of the way, but the life of an idealist who may be irreplaceable is placed in jeopardy. For my own part, I believe that small thieves should not be hanged while big thieves are allowed go free. One day a national tribunal will have to judge and sentence some tens of thousands of organisers who were responsible for the criminal November betrayal and all the consequences that followed on it. Such an example will teach the necessary lesson, once, and for ever, to such as those paltry traitors who revealed to the enemy the places where arms were hidden. On the grounds of these considerations I steadfastly forbade all participation in secret societies, and I took care that the Storm Detachment should not assume such a character.*

*In so far as the members have to undergo a thorough physical training, attention must not be focussed mainly on military drill, but rather on the practice of sports. I have always considered boxing and ju-jitsu more important than training in rifle shooting, which, if inadequate, is definitely bad. If the German nation were presented with a body of six million young men who had been perfectly trained in athletic sports, who were imbued with an ardent love of their country and were ready to take the initiative in a fight, then the nationalist State could make an army out of that body within less than two years, if necessary, provided the cadres already existed. The situation being what it is to-day, the cadres would be furnished only by the Reichswehr, and not by a defence league that was neither one thing nor the other. Physical fitness must develop in the individual a conviction of his superiority and give him that confidence which is always based only on the consciousness of one’s own prowess. It must also develop that athletic agility which can be employed as a defensive weapon in the service of the Movement.*

*When the National Socialists arrived at the great square it was already half full, but no banners were displayed. Our*  

- Page 604 (location ~ 9248-9249)    

*Our arrival aroused unbounded enthusiasm. I myself had the honour of being one of the speakers who addressed that crowd of about sixty thousand people. The demonstration was an overwhelming success, especially because it was proved for the first time that nationalist Munich could march through the streets, in spite of all threats from the Reds. Members of the organisation for the defence of the Red Republic endeavoured to hinder the marching columns by their terrorist activities, but they were scattered by the companies of the Storm Detachment within a few minutes and sent packing. The National Socialist Movement then showed for the first time that in future it was determined to exercise its right to march through the streets and thus deprive the international traitors and enemies of the country of their monopoly of this privilege. The events of that, day provided incontestable proof that our views on the creation of the Storm Detachment were right, both from the psychological standpoint and from the point of view of organisation. The principle having thus been proved correct we pushed on with the establishment of Storm Detachment units so that within a few weeks the number of Munich units was doubled.*  

- Page 604 (location ~ 9249-9258)    

*This was the first time that a special train for us was run in Germany. At all the places where the new units of the Storm Detachment joined us, our train caused a sensation. Many of the people had never seen our banner and it created a very great impression. When we arrived at the station in Coburg we were received by a deputation of the organising committee of the German Rally. They announced that by order of the local tradeunions—that is to say, the Independent and Communist Parties—it had been ‘arranged’ that we should not enter the town with our banners unfurled and our band playing (we had a hand consisting of forty-two musicians with us) and that we should not march in formation. I immediately rejected these undignified conditions and did not fail to declare to the gentlemen who had arranged this ‘rally’ how astonished I was at the idea of their negotiating with such people and coming to an arrangement with them. Then I announced that the Storm Troops would immediately march into the town in company formation, with flags flying and band playing—which we proceeded to do forthwith. As we emerged in to the station square we were met by a hissing, yelling mob of several thousands, which greeted us with shouts of: ‘Assassins!’ ‘Bandits!’ ‘Robbers!’ ‘Criminals!’ These were the choice names which these exemplary founders of the German Republic showered on us. The young Storm Detachment gave a fine exhibition of discipline. The companies fell into formation in the square in front of the station and at first took no notice of the insults hurled at them by the mob.*  

- Page 605 (location ~ 9264-9277)    

*We now marched back along the same route by which we had come, in the direction of our quarters and there we had to make a stand against the crowd. As their cries and yells all along the route had failed to disturb the equanimity of our companies, the champions of true Socialism, Equality, and Fraternity, now took to throwing stones. That brought our patience to an end. For ten minutes blows fell right and left, like a devastating shower of hail. Fifteen minutes later there were no Reds to be seen in the street. After nightfall serious clashes occurred. Patrols of the Storm Detachment had discovered National Socialists who had been attacked singly and were in a dangerous condition. Thereupon we made short work of the opponents. By the following morning the Red Terror, under which Coburg had been suffering for years, was definitely broken. With typical Marxist and Jewish mendacity, an attempt was made by the distribution of leaflets to passers-by in the street to incite the ‘comrades of the International Proletariat’ to demonstrate, once more in the public streets. Completely distorting the facts, they declared that our ‘bands of assassins’ had commenced ‘a war of extermination against the peaceful workers of Coburg.’*  

- Page 606 (location ~ 9283-9293)    

*The bourgeois press as a whole adopted, as usual, an attitude that was partly lachrymose and partly mean. Only a few decent newspapers expressed their satisfaction that in one locality at least, the Marxist street-bullies had been effectively dealt with. In Coburg itself, at least a section of the Marxist workers who must be looked upon as misled, learned from the blows of National Socialist fists that they too, were workers fighting for ideals, because experience teaches that the human being fights only for something in which he believes and which he loves. The Storm Detachment itself benefited most from the Coburg expedition. It grew so quickly in numbers that at the Party Congress in January 1923, six thousand men participated in the ceremony of consecrating the flags and the first companies appeared for the first time in the glory of their new uniform. Our experience at Coburg proved how essential it was to introduce one distinctive uniform for the Storm Detachment, not only for the purpose of strengthening its esprit de corps, but also to avoid confusion and the danger of not recognising the opponent in a fight. Up to that time they had merely been distinguished by the armlet, but now the tunic and the well-known cap were added. The experience gained at Coburg had also another important result. We now determined to break the Red Terror in all those localities in which it had for many years prevented men of other views from holding meetings.*

*During the spring and summer of 1923 it was transformed into a fighting military organisation. It is to this reorganisation that we must in great part attribute the later developments that took place during 1923, in so far as these affected our Movement. Elsewhere I shall deal in broad outline with the events of 1923. Here I wish only to state that the transformation of the Storm Detachment at that time was detrimental to the interests of the Movement, since the condition (namely, the adoption of a policy of active resistance against France) which had led to the change, was never realised. The events which took place at the close of 1923, terrible as they may appear at first sight, were almost a necessity if looked at from a higher standpoint; because in view of the attitude taken by the Government of the German Reich, the conversion of the Storm Troops into a military force became meaningless and thus a transformation which would have proved harmful to the Movement was stopped forthwith. Thereby it was made possible for us to set about the task of reconstruction at the point at which we had been diverted from our proper course. In the year 1925 the National Socialist German Labour Party was re-founded and had to organise and train its Storm Detachment once again according to the principles I had laid down. It must revert, to its original sound views and must once more consider as its most essential function the establishment of its Storm Detachments as an instrument of defence and strength in the Movement’s struggle to establish its Weltanschauung and once more it must consider it as its most essential task to function as the instrument of defence and reinforcement in the spiritual struggle to establish the ideals of the Movement. The Storm Detachment must not be allowed to sink to the level of something in the nature of a defence league or a secret society. Steps must rather be taken to make it a force one hundred thousand strong to act as champion of the National Socialist, and thus of the genuinely völkisch ideal.*

*The incredible fashion in which our national economy was administered during the War through an absolutely crazy system of centralisation by means of which the whole Reich territory was brought under its control and exploited, furnished the principal grounds for the growth of anti-Prussian feeling. The average citizen looked upon the companies formed for the collection and distribution of war-time supplies, all of which had their headquarters in Berlin, as identical with Berlin, and Berlin itself as identical with Prussia. The average citizen did not realise that the organisation of these robber companies, which were called war-companies, was not in the hands of either Berlin or Prussia or even in German hands at all. People recognised only the gross irregularities and the continual encroachments perpetrated by that hated institution in the metropolis of the Reich and directed their anger against Berlin and Prussia, all the more because in certain quarters nothing was done to correct this attitude, but it was even welcomed with silent satisfaction. The Jew was far too shrewd not to understand that the infamous campaign which he had organised, under the disguise of war-companies, for plundering the German nation must eventually arouse opposition. As long as that opposition was not directed against himself he had no reason to be afraid. Hence he decided that the best way of forestalling an outbreak of hatred against himself on the part of the enraged and desperate masses was to direct their wrath against someone else and thus to allow it to burn itself out.*

Let Bavaria quarrel as much as it liked with Prussia and Prussia with Bavaria! The more bitter the strife between the two states, the greater the security of the Jew.*

*The international Jew Kurt Eisner, began to play off Bavaria against Prussia. This Oriental was the last person in the world fitted to defend the interests of Bavaria, since in following his profession as a newspaper reporter, he had wandered from place to place all over Germany, and of all the world, Bavaria was the place which interested him least. In deliberately giving the revolutionary rising in Bavaria the character of an offensive against the rest of the Reich, Kurt Eisner was not by any means acting from the standpoint of Bavarian interests, but merely as the authorised representative of Jewry. He exploited existing instincts and antipathies in Bavaria as a means of facilitating the dismemberment of Germany. Once dismembered, the Reich would fall an easy prey to Bolshevism. The tactics employed by him were continued for a time after his death. The Marxists, who had always derided the individual German states and their princes, now suddenly appealed, as an ‘Independent Party’, to those sentiments and instincts which had their strongest roots in the houses of the reigning princes and in the individual states.*

*The art of the Bolshevist agitators, in representing the suppression of the Bavarian Soviet Republic as a victory of ‘Prussian militarism’ over the ‘anti-militarist’ and ‘anti-Prussian’ people of Bavaria, bore rich fruit. Whereas at the elections for the Bavarian Legislative Diet in Munich, Kurt Eisner did not have ten thousand followers and the Communist Party less than three thousand, after the fall of the Bavarian Republic, the two parties together could reckon on nearly one hundred thousand voting in their favour. It was at this time that I began my own struggle against the folly of inciting one branch of the German people against the other. I believe that never in my life did I undertake a more unpopular task than I did when I took my stand against the anti-Prussian agitation. During the Soviet regime in Munich great public meetings were held at which hatred against the rest of Germany, but particularly against Prussia, was roused to such a pitch that a North German would have risked his life in attending one of those meetings. These meetings often ended in wild shouts of ‘Away from Prussia,’ Down with Prussia,’ ‘War against Prussia,’ and so on. This feeling was openly expressed in the Reichstag by a particularly brilliant defender of Bavarian sovereign rights, when he said: ‘Rather let us die Bavarians than rot as Prussians.’ Only those who attended some of the meetings held at that time can realise what it implied for me personally, when, for the first time and surrounded by only a handful of friends, I raised my voice against this folly at a meeting held in the Münchener Lowenbrau-Keller. My war comrades stood by me then. It is easy to imagine how we felt when we were howled at and threatened by a raging crowd, which was beyond all control and composed of men who, while we had been defending our country, had for the most part been deserters and shirkers skulking in billets behind the lines or at home. It is true that such episodes turned out to be of advantage to me. My small band of comrades felt for the first time absolutely united with me and readily swore to stand by me to the death. These clashes, which were constantly repeated throughout the year 1919, seemed to become more violent soon after the beginning of 1921. There were meetings I remember especially one*

There were meetings I remember especially one in the Wagnersaal in the Sonnenstrasse in Munich, during the course of which my group, now grown much larger, had to defend itself against assaults of the most violent character. It happened more than once that dozens of my followers were manhandled, thrown to the floor and stamped upon by the attackers and were finally thrown out of the hall more dead than alive. The struggle upon which I had embarked, first on my own, and supported only by my war-comrades, was now continued by the young Movement, I might say almost as a sacred mission.*

*What an outcry would have been raised in Munich if some Prussian conservative party had declared itself in favour of detaching Franconia from Bavaria, or had publicly demanded or taken steps to promote such a separatist policy. Nevertheless, one cannot but feel sympathy for the genuine federalists who did not see through this infamous swindle, for they were its principal victims. By distorting the federalist idea in such a way, its own champions prepared its grave. One cannot make propaganda for a federal form of government within the Reich by debasing, abusing and besmirching the essential element of such a political structure, namely Prussia, and thus making such a state impossible as a member of the federation. It is all the more, incredible by reason of the fact that the fight carried on by those socalled federalists was directed against that section of the Prussian people which was the last that could be regarded as being connected with the November democracy. For the abuse and attacks of these socalled federalists were not levelled against the authors of the Weimar Constitution—the majority of whom were South Germans or Jews—but against those who represented the old conservative Prussia, which was the antithesis of the Weimar Constitution. The fact that those who directed this campaign were careful not to touch the Jews is not to be wondered at and perhaps gives the key to the whole riddle. Before the Revolution, the Jew was successful in distracting attention from himself and his war-companies by inciting the masses, and especially the Bavarians, against Prussia; similarly, he felt obliged, after the Revolution, to find some way of camouflaging his new marauding campaign, the scope of which had increased tenfold. Again he succeeded, in this case by provoking the socalled ‘national’ elements in Germany against one another—the conservative Bavarians against the Prussians, who were just as conservative.*

*The Schutz and Trutzbund (Watch and Ward League) was defectively organised, but at least it had the great merit of opening up the Jewish question once again. In the winter of 1918–1919 a kind of anti-Semitism slowly began to take root. Later on, the National Socialist Movement presented the Jewish problem in a new light. Taking the question beyond the restricted circles of the upper classes and small bourgeoisie we succeeded in transforming it into the vital motive of a great popular movement, but the moment we were successful in placing this problem before the German people in the light of an idea that would unite them in one struggle, the Jew reacted. He resorted to his old tactics. With amazing alacrity lie, sowed the seeds of discord within the völkisch movement itself and started a rift there. The raising of the ultramontane question and the resulting quarrels between Catholic and Protestant presented, under the conditions then prevailing, the only possibility of diverting public attention to other matters and staving off a concentrated attack upon the Jews. The men who dragged our people into this controversy can never make amends for the crime they then committed against the nation.*  

- Page 618 (location ~ 9468-9477)    

*Anyhow, the Jew has attained his ends. Catholics and Protestants are fighting one another to their heart’s content, while the enemy of Aryan humanity and of all Christendom is laughing up his sleeve. Just as it was once possible to occupy the attention of the public for several years with the struggle between federalism and unification, wearing out its energy in this mutual friction, while the Jew trafficked in the freedom of the nation and sold our country to the masters of international high finance—so in our day he has succeeded again, this time by raising strife between the two German religious denominations, while the foundations on which both rest are being eaten away and destroyed through the poison injected by international and cosmopolitan Jewry. Look at the injuries which our people are suffering daily as a result of being contaminated with Jewish blood. Bear in mind the fact that this poisonous contamination can be eliminated from the national body only after the lapse of centuries, if ever.*  

- Page 619 (location ~ 9477-9485)    

*The two Christian denominations look on with indifference at the profanation and destruction of a noble and unique creature who was given to the world as a gift of God’s grace. As regards the future of the world, it does not matter which of the two triumphs, the Catholic or the Protestant faith, but it does matter whether Aryan humanity survives or perishes. Yet the two Christian denominations are not contending against the destroyer of Aryan humanity, but are trying to destroy one another. It is the sacred duty, particularly of those who adopt a patriotic attitude, to see to it that within the framework of their own particular denomination, they do not render mere lip-service to God, but actually fulfil the Will of God and do not allow His handiwork to be debarred, for it was by the Will of God that man was created in a certain image and endowed with certain characteristics and certain faculties. Whoever destroys His work, wages war against God’s creation and God’s will. Therefore, everyone should endeavour, each in his own denomination, of course, and should consider it as his first and most solemn duty, to hinder any and every one whose conduct tends, either by word or deed, to overstep the limits of his own religious community and to raise a quarrel with those of another denomination. For, in view of the religious schism that exists in Germany, to attack the essential characteristics of one denomination must necessarily lead to a war of extermination between the two Christian denominations. There can be no comparison between our position and that of France, Spain or Italy. In those three countries one may, for instance, make propaganda for the side that is fighting against clericalism or ultramontanism, without thereby incurring the danger of a national rift among the French, Spanish or Italian people. In Germany, however, that cannot be done, for here the Protestants would also take part in such a movement and thus the defence, which elsewhere only Catholics organise against clerical interference by their own prelates in political matters, would assume with us the character of a Protestant attack against Catholicism. What may be tolerated by the faithful belonging to one denomination even when it seems unjust to them, will at once be indignantly rejected and opposed on a priori grounds if it should come from the militant leaders of another denomination.*

*The National Socialist Movement has set itself the task of converting those Communists, but anyone who goes outside the ranks of his own movement and tends to divert it from the fulfilment of its mission, is acting in a manner that deserves the severest condemnation. He is acting as a champion of Jewish interests, whether consciously or unconsciously does not matter, for it is to the interest of the Jews to-day that the energies of the völkisch movement should be frittered away in a religious conflict, because it is beginning to be dangerous for the Jews. I have purposely used the phrase about ‘frittering away’ the energies of the movement, because no one but he who is entirely ignorant of history could imagine that this movement can to-day solve a question which the greatest statesmen have tried for centuries to solve, and tried in vain. Anyhow, the facts speak for themselves. The men who suddenly discovered in 1924, that the highest mission of the völkisch movement was to fight ultramontanism, have not succeeded in smashing it, but they did succeed in splitting the völkisch movement.*  

- Page 621 (location ~ 9517-9525)    

*In recent years things have gone so far that völkisch circles, in the god-forsaken blindness of their religious strife, could not recognise the folly of their conduct even in the light of the fact that atheist Marxist newspapers advocated the cause of one religious denomination or the other, according as it suited them—so as to inculpate now the one party and now the other by the repetition of remarks which were often incredibly foolish, thus fanning the fire to keep the blaze at its highest. To a people like the Germans, whose history, has so often shown them capable of fighting for phantoms to the point of complete exhaustion, every slogan of this kind is a mortal danger. By these slogans the attention of our people has too often been diverted from the real problems affecting their very existence. While we were exhausting our energies in religious wars, other countries were acquiring their share of the world, and while the völkisch movement is debating with itself whether the ultramontane danger be greater than the Jewish, or vice versa, the Jew is destroying the racial basis of our existence and thereby annihilating our people. As regards that kind of völkisch champion, I pray with all my heart on behalf of the National Socialist Movement and therefore of the German people, ‘Lord, preserve us from such friends, that we can more easily deal with our enemies.’ The controversy over federation and unification, so cunningly propagated by the Jews in 1919–1920 and thereafter, forced National Socialism, which repudiated the quarrel, to take up a definite attitude in relation to the essential problems bound up with it.*

*What is a federation of states? By a federation of states we mean a union of sovereign states which, of their own free will, and by virtue of their sovereignty come together and create a collective unit, ceding to that unit as much of their own sovereign rights as will render the existence of the union possible and will guarantee it. The theoretical formula is not put wholly into practice by any federation of states that exists to-day, least of all by the American Union, where it is impossible to speak of original sovereignty in regard to the majority of the states. Many of them were not included in the federal complex until long after it had been established. The states that make up the American Union are mostly in the nature of greater or smaller territories, limited for technical administrative purposes, their boundaries having in many cases been fixed in the mapping office. Originally, these states did not and could not possess sovereign rights of their own, since they did not combine to form the Union, but it was, on the contrary, the Union which created a number of these socalled states.*  

- Page 623 (location ~ 9550-9558)    

*Only in very few cases can it be asserted that the sovereign rights which the individual states renounced in order to render possible the foundation of the Reich were ceded voluntarily, since, for the most part, they did not exist in reality. In other instances they were simply done away with under the pressure exerted by the more powerful Prussia. The principle followed by Bismarck was not, to give to the Reich what he could take from the individual states, but to demand from the individual states only what was absolutely necessary for the Reich. A moderate and wise policy! On the one, hand, Bismarck showed the greatest regard for customs and traditions; on the other hand his policy secured for the new Reich, from its foundation onwards, a great measure of love and willing cooperation. It would, however, be a fundamental error to attribute Bismarck’s decision to any conviction on his part that the Reich had thus acquired such rights of sovereignty as would suffice for all time. That was far from being Bismarck’s idea. On the contrary, he wished to leave it to the future to settle what would be difficult to carry through at the moment and might not have been readily agreed to by the individual states. He trusted to the levelling effect of time and to the pressure exercised by the process of evolution, the steady action of which appeared to him more effective than an attempt to break the resistance which the individual states offered at the moment. By adopting this policy, he showed his mastery of the art of statesmanship. As a matter of fact, the sovereignty of the Reich has continually increased at the cost of the sovereignty of the individual states. The passing of time has achieved what Bismarck hoped it would. The German collapse and the abolition of the monarchical form of government necessarily hastened this development. The German federal states, which had not been grounded on ethnological foundations, but arose rather out of political conditions, were bound to lose their importance the moment the monarchical form of government and the dynasties connected with it were abolished. For it was to the spirit inherent in these that the individual states owed their political origin and development. Thus deprived of their internal raison d’être, many of these petty states renounced all right to survival and were induced for purely practical reasons to fuse with their neighbours, or else they joined the more powerful states of their own free will. This proved in a striking manner low extraordinarily frail was the actual sovereignty these small states enjoyed, and it proved too, how lightly they were esteemed by their own citizens.*  

- Page 625 (location ~ 9578-9598)    

*Bismarck’s Reich was free and unhampered by any obligations towards the outside world. Bismarck’s Reich never had to shoulder such heavy and entirely unproductive obligations as those imposed on Germany under the Dawes Plan. Even at home the authority of Bismarck’s Reich was confined to dealing with only a few absolutely essential matters. It was, therefore, possible for the Reich to dispense with the necessity for financial control over the federal states and to live on their contributions. It goes without saying that, on the one hand, the preservation of certain of their sovereign rights and, on the other, the relatively small financial tribute which the federal states had to pay to the Reich induced them to welcome its existence. But it is untrue and unfair to state now, as certain propagandists do that the federal states were antagonistic to the Reich merely because of their financial subjection to it. That is not the true state of affairs. The lack of sympathy for the political idea embodied in the Reich is not due to the loss of sovereign rights on the part of the individual states. It is much more the result of the deplorable fashion in which the present regime acts as the representative of the German people.*  

- Page 628 (location ~ 9617-9626)    

*The wedge is being driven ever deeper and every new debt which the Reich contracts, through the criminal way in which the interests of Germany are represented vis-à-vis foreign countries, necessitates the exertion of fresh and stronger pressure at home. This again entails the progressive abolition of all the sovereign rights of the individual states in order to prevent the germs of opposition from becoming active or even from coming into being. The chief characteristic difference between the policy of the present Reich and that of former times lies in this: The old Reich gave freedom to its people at home and showed itself strong towards the outside world, whereas the Republic shows itself weak towards the foreigner and oppresses its own citizens at home. In both cases one attitude determines the other. A vigorous national state does not need to make many laws for the interior, because of the affection and loyalty of its citizens. The international servile state can live only by coercing its citizens to render it the services it demands, and it is a piece of impudence for the present regime to speak of ‘free citizens.’*

*The Republic has given itself the character of an intermezzo in German history. This State is bound to restrict the sovereign rights of the individual states more and more, not only for general reasons of a financial character, but also on principle, for by enforcing a policy of financial blackmail. In order to squeeze the last ounce of substance out of its people, it is forced also to deprive them of their last remaining rights, lest the general discontent may one day flare up into open rebellion. We National Socialists would reverse this formula and would adopt the following fundamental principle: A strong national Reich which in its foreign policy represents and protects the interests of its citizens in the highest possible degree can allow freedom to reign at home without trembling for the safety of the State. On the other hand, a strong national government can encroach to a considerable degree on the liberties of the individual subject as well as on the liberties of the constituent states without thereby weakening the ideal of the Reich; and it is justified in so doing, if in these particular acts and measures the individual citizen recognises a means of promoting the prestige of the nation as a whole. It is a fact that the tendency in every state throughout the world is towards uniformity, and Germany will prove no exception in this respect. Even to-day it is absurd to talk of the sovereignty of individual states because this has already become impossible on account of the ridiculously small size of so many of these states.*

*The purely technical difficulties connected with the administration of a State like Germany are not greater than those connected with the government of a province like Brandenburg a hundred and twenty years ago. To-day it is easier to cover the distance from Munich to Berlin than it was to cover the distance from Munich to Starnberg a hundred years ago. Thanks to modern means of transport, the whole territory of the Reich to-day is smaller than that of certain German federal states at the time of the Napoleonic wars. To close one’s eyes to the consequences of these facts is to live in the past. There always were, there are, and always will be, men who do this. They may retard, but they cannot stop the wheels of history.*

*We must fight against the present system of centralising institutions that are vitally important for the existence of our people, because this system is being adopted solely to facilitate the payment of milliards and the transference of pledges to the foreigner in accordance with our post-war foreign policy. For this reason the National Socialist Movement has to take up a stand against any such attempt. A second reason why we must oppose such centralisation is because in domestic affairs it helps to reinforce a system of government which in all its manifestations has brought the greatest misfortunes on the German nation. The present Jewish-Democratic Reich, which has become a veritable curse to the German people, is seeking to negate the force of the criticism offered by all the federal states which have not yet become imbued with the spirit of the age, and is trying to carry out this policy by reducing them to complete insignificance. We National Socialists, on the other hand, have every reason for attempting not only to establish the opposition of those individual states on the basis of a constitutional force which promises to be successful, but to make their struggle against centralisation as a whole the expression of higher national German interests in a wide sense.*  

- Page 633 (location ~ 9694-9703)    

*Since the foundation of the Republic the Jews especially have been obtaining positions in the economic institutions taken over by the Reich and also positions in the national administration, so that the one and the other have become the preserves of Jewry. For tactical reasons, this last consideration obliges us to watch with the greatest attention any further move in the direction of centralisation and fight it at every step. But in doing this our standpoint must always be that of a lofty national policy and never of pettifogging particularism.*  

- Page 634 (location ~ 9712-9716)    

*As regards this right we cannot, and must not, entertain the slightest doubt. Since for us the State is nothing but a vessel and its contents (that is to say, the nation, the people) the essential factor, it is clear that every other interest must be subordinated to the supreme interests of the nation. In particular, we cannot accredit to any other state a sovereign power and sovereign rights within the confines of the nation and the Reich, which represents the nation. The absurdity which some federal states commit by maintaining ‘representatives’ abroad and among themselves must, and will, cease.*  

- Page 634 (location ~ 9718-9722)    

*The real truth is that these small federal states are envisaged as points of attack in connection with any attempt to bring about disintegration, engineered either from within or from without the German Reich, which attempts are always pleasing to a certain foreign State. We National Socialists must not allow some noble but degenerate family to obtain for one of its semi-moribund scions a ministerial post abroad with the idea that he might thrive in pastures new. Even in the days of the old Reich our diplomatic representatives abroad were such a sorry lot that further experiments of that kind are highly undesirable. It is certain that in the future the importance of the individual states will be transferred to the sphere of our cultural policy.*  

- Page 635 (location ~ 9726-9732)    

*The Army must definitely be kept clear of the influence of the individual states. The coming National Socialist State must not fall back into the error of the past by imposing on the Army a task which is not within its sphere and should never be assigned to it. The German Army is not meant to be a school for the preservation of provincial idiosyncrasies, but a school in which all Germans will learn to understand and adapt themselves to each other’s ways. Whatever tends to have a separating influence in the life of the nation ought to be made a unifying influence in the Army. The Army must raise the German boy above the narrow horizon of his own little native province and make him conscious that he is part of the nation. The youth must learn to know, not the confines of his own district, but those of his Fatherland, because it is the latter that he will have to defend one day. It is, therefore, absurd to have the German youth do his military training in his own native district. During that period he ought to learn to know Germany. This is all the more important to-day, since young Germans no longer travel during their years of apprenticeship as they once used to do, thus enlarging their horizon.*  

- Page 636 (location ~ 9745-9754)    

*National Socialism must claim the right to impose its principles on the whole German nation, without regard to what were hitherto the confines of federal states. We must educate the German nation in our ideology and principles. As the Churches do not feel themselves bound or limited by political frontiers, so the National Socialist ideology cannot be confined to any of the federal states which constitute our Fatherland. The National Socialist doctrine is not meant to serve the political interests of the individual federal states, but to dominate the whole German nation. It must determine the life of the whole people and shape that life anew. For this reason we must imperatively demand the right to overstep boundaries that have been traced by a political development which we repudiate. The more complete the triumph of the National Socialist ideology, the greater will be the liberty which it can concede to the individual within the State.*

*As soon as an organisation functions mechanically from above, there is always the danger that some individual who has been appointed to a certain office, but who has not yet proved his mettle and may be far from efficient, will, from motives of sheer jealousy, try to hinder abler persons from taking a leading place in the movement. The damage that results from that kind of thing may have fatal consequences, especially in a new movement. For this reason it is advisable first to propagate and publicly expound the ideas on which the movement is founded. This work of propaganda should continue for a certain time and should be directed from one centre. When the ideas have gradually won over a number of people this human material should be carefully sifted for the purpose of selecting those who have, ability in leadership and of putting that ability to the test. It will often be found that apparently insignificant persons nevertheless turn out to be born leaders. At the same time it is quite wrong to imagine that possession of vast theoretical knowledge is a proof of capacity for leadership. The contrary is very frequently the case. Great theorists are only very rarely great organisers, because the greatness of the theorist and founder of a system coexists in being able to discover and lay down those laws that are right in the abstract, whereas the organiser must be first and foremost a psychologist. He must take men as they are, and for that reason he must know them, and have neither too high nor too low an estimate of human nature.*  

- Page 638 (location ~ 9781-9793)    

*To be a leader means to be able to move the masses. The gift of formulating ideas has nothing whatsoever to do with the capacity for leadership. It would be entirely futile to discuss the question as to which is the more important—the faculty for conceiving ideals and human aims or that of being able to realise them. Here, as so often in this world, the one would be entirely meaningless without the other. The noblest theoretical conceptions remain without purpose or value, if the leader cannot move the masses to accept them, and, conversely, what would it avail to have all the genius and verve of a leader if the intellectual theorist does not fix the aims for which mankind must struggle? But when the abilities of theorist, organiser and leader are united in the one person, then we have the rarest phenomenon on this earth, for it is that union which makes the great man. As I have already said, during my early days in the Party I devoted myself to the work of propaganda. I had to succeed in gradually gathering together a small nucleus of men who became imbued with the new doctrine, thus providing the human material which was subsequently to form the first elements of an organisation.*  

- Page 640 (location ~ 9800-9809)    

*Every movement which has gained its human material must first divide this material into two groups, namely, adherents and members. It is the task of the propagandist to gain adherents and it is the task of the organising body to enlist members. The adherent of a movement is he who sympathises with and accepts its aims, while the member is he who fights for them. The adherent is one for whom propaganda has converted to the doctrine of the movement. The member is he who will be charged by the organising body with collaborating in winning ever new adherents who will in turn become new members. Since to be an adherent demands only passive acceptance of an ideal, whereas membership implies championing and defending it, there will never be more than two members to every ten adherents. Adhesion is based only on comprehension, whereas membership is founded on the courage to stand up for what has been comprehended and accepted and to propound it to others. The majority, being lazy and timid, is content with passive acceptance of a doctrine and only a minority will assume the responsibility of membership which implies readiness to defend one’s opinions. Such being the case, the propagandist must seek untiringly to acquire new followers for the movement, whereas the organising body must see to it that only the best elements among these followers are admitted to membership. The propagandist need not trouble about the personal worth of the individual converts he has won over to the movement. He need not inquire into their abilities, their intelligence or their character. From among these converts, however, the organising body will have to select those individuals who are most capable of actively helping to achieve victory for the movement. The propagandist aims at inducing the whole people to accept his teaching. The organising body includes within the framework of membership only those who, on psychological grounds, will not impede the further diffusion of the doctrines of the movement. The propagandist inculcates his doctrine upon the minds of the nation as a whole, preparing it for the time when this doctrine will triumph, whereas the organising body brings that triumph nearer by the continual, organic and combatant cohesion of those followers who have given proof of the necessary ability and will-power to carry on the struggle until victory is won. The more effectively propaganda has swayed the people as a whole and the more exclusive, rigorous and rigid the organisation, the greater the possibility of the triumph of its ideology.*

*An ideological revolution will always be most successful, if the new ideology has been taught to the entire population, or if necessary, forced upon it subsequently, whilst, on the other hand, the movement itself, the organisation, should comprise only the minimum number of persons required to man the nerve-centres of the state in question. Put in another way, this means that in every great revolutionary movement of world-importance, the ideals of that movement must always first be propagated through the operation of propaganda. The propagandist must never tire in his efforts to make the new ideas clearly understood, to persuade others to adopt them and to endeavour to shake their confidence in the convictions they have hitherto held.*

The propagandist must never tire in his efforts to make the new ideas clearly understood, to persuade others to adopt them and to endeavour to shake their confidence in the convictions they have hitherto held. In order that such propaganda should have a firm character, it must be based on an organisation. The organisation gains its members from any among those followers whom propaganda has won over and will grow the more rapidly if the work of propaganda be pushed forward intensively, and it will be all the more effective if the organisation at the back of it is vigorous and strong in itself. Hence, the supreme task of the organising body is to see to it that any discord or differences which may arise among the members of the movement will not lead to a split and thereby cramp the work within the movement.*  

- Page 642 (location ~ 9840-9850)    

*So long as a movement has to carry on a hard and bitter fight, people of weak and fundamentally egotistic temperament will steer clear of it; but these will try to be accepted as members the moment the party appears likely to achieve, or has already achieved, a great measure of success. It is for this reason that so many movements which are at first successful, slow down before reaching the fulfilment of their purpose and, from an inner weakness which cannot otherwise be explained, give up the struggle and finally disappear from the field. As a result of the early successes achieved, so many undesirable, unworthy and especially timid individuals become members of the movement that they are finally in the majority and overrule those who are filled with the fighting-spirit, use the movement to gain their own ends, dragging it down to their own petty level and do nothing to bring about the triumph of the original idea. The fire of the first fervour dies out, the fighting spirit flags and, as the bourgeois world is accustomed to remark (and in this case with some justice) the wine has become mixed with water and then it is, of course, impossible to achieve great things. For this reason it is necessary that a movement should, from the sheer instinct of self-preservation, close its list of membership the moment it becomes successful, while any further increase in its organisation should be undertaken only after the most careful precautions have been taken and after a painstaking sifting of those who apply for membership. Only thus will it be possible to keep the kernel of the movement intact, fresh and sound. Care must be taken that the conduct of the movement remains exclusively in the hands of the original nucleus, which means that this nucleus must direct the propaganda which aims at securing general recognition for the movement and is the central authority which decides what measures are to be adopted for the practical realisation of its ideals. The organisation should not only appoint the men who formed the original nucleus of the movement to all the important positions in those parts of the country that have been won over, but should see to it that the entire governing body is composed of such elements.*

*As director of propaganda for the Party, I took care not merely to prepare the ground for the size of the Movement in its subsequent stages, but I also adopted the most radical type of propaganda in order to make sure that none but the best would enter the organization. For the more radical and stirring my propaganda was, the more did it frighten away weak and wavering*

*As director of propaganda for the Party, I took care not merely to prepare the ground for the size of the Movement in its subsequent stages, but I also adopted the most radical type of propaganda in order to make sure that none but the best would enter the organization. For the more radical and stirring my propaganda was, the more did it frighten away weak and wavering characters, thus preventing them from entering the first nucleus of our organisation. Perhaps they remained followers, but they did not advertise the fact, on the contrary, they maintained a discreet silence on the subject. Many thousands of persons then assured me that although they were in full agreement with us, they could not on any account become members of our Party. They said that the Movement was so radical that to take part in it as members would expose them to grave censure and even danger, so that nobody could take it amiss if an honest, peace-loving citizen chose to remain in the background, for the time being at least, though devoted wholeheartedly to our cause. This was all to the good. If all those men, who in their hearts did not approve of the Revolution, had joined our Movement as members at that time, we could regard ourselves to-day as a pious confraternity and not as a young Movement inspired with the spirit of combat. The lively and combative form which I gave to all our propaganda at that time fortified and guaranteed the radical tendency of our Movement, and the result was that, with few exceptions, only men of radical views were disposed to become members.*  

- Page 645 (location ~ 9886-9898)    

*In the place of decisions by majority vote of the committee, the principle of absolute responsibility was introduced. The chairman is responsible for the whole control of the Movement. He apportions the work to be done among the members of the committee subordinate to him and for special work he selects other individuals. Each of these gentlemen must bear sole responsibility for the task assigned to him. He is subordinate only to the chairman, whose duty is to supervise the general collaboration, selecting the personnel and giving general directions as to how cooperation is to be achieved. This principle of absolute responsibility has gradually become a matter of course within the Movement, at least in so far as the management of the Party is concerned. In the small local groups and perhaps also in the regional and district groups it will take yet a long time before the principle can be thoroughly imposed, because the timid and inefficient are naturally opposed to it. For them the idea of bearing absolute responsibility for an action opens up an unpleasant prospect and they feel more at ease and safer if, faced with a difficult decision, they have the support of the majority on a socalled committee. But it seems to me a matter of absolute necessity to take a decisive stand against that view, to make no concessions whatsoever to this fear of responsibility, even though it will take some time before we can attain this concept of duty and ability in leadership, which will place in positions of authority only those who possess the necessary gifts and are selected for the work. In any case, a movement which has to fight against the absurdity of parliamentary institutions must itself be immune from them. Only thus will it have the requisite strength to carry on the struggle. It is absolutely certain that a movement which, in an era in which the majority principle holds good in every sphere of life, adopts as its fundamental principle that of leadership (and consequently the assumption of responsibility by the leaders), will one day succeed in abolishing and triumphing over existing conditions.*

*In the old Sterneckerbräu im Tal, there was a small vault-like room which in earlier times had served the Bavarian Counsellors of the Holy Roman Empire as a tap-room when they foregathered. It was dark and dismal and accordingly well suited to its ancient uses, though less suited to the new purpose it was now destined to serve. The little street on which its one window looked out was so narrow that even on the brightest summer day the room remained dim and sombre. This became our first office. As the rent came to only fifty marks per month, (then an enormous sum for us) we could not expect very much and we dared not complain even when the wooden wainscoting was removed a few days before we took possession. This panelling had been specially put up for the Imperial Counsellors. The place began to look more like a tomb than an office. Still it marked an important step forward. By degrees, we had electric light installed and later on a telephone. A table and some borrowed chairs were put in, open bookshelves, and afterwards, a cupboard. Two sideboards, which belonged to the landlord, served to store our leaflets, placards, etc. As time went on, it proved impossible to direct the course of the Movement merely by holding a committee meeting once a week.*

*The Movement had still so few members that it was hard to find among them a suitable person for the job, who would be content with very little for himself and would at the same time be ready to meet the manifold demands which the Movement would make on his time and energy. After a long search we discovered a soldier who consented to become our first business-manager. His name was Schüssler, an old war-time comrade of mine. At first he came to our new office every day between six and eight o’clock in the evening, later on he came from five to eight and subsequently for the whole afternoon; finally, it became a full-time job and he worked in the office from morning until late at night. He was an industrious, upright and thoroughly honest man, who was exceedingly painstaking and a loyal supporter of the Movement. He brought with him a small Adler typewriter of his own—it was the first typewriter to be used in the service of the Party. Subsequently, the Party bought it, paying for it in instalments. We needed a small safe in order to keep our papers and register of members out of harm’s way, not to hold our funds, which were then non-existent. On the contrary, our financial position was so hopeless that I often had to dip into my own personal savings.*

*The man who does valuable work for the nation expresses thereby the soundness of his political opinions, whereas another who merely talks about his opinions and does nothing that is of real value to the nation is detrimental to any real political opinion, and his attitude is also prejudicial to his particular political party. The Völkischer Beobachter was a socalled völkisch paper as its name indicates. It had all the good qualities, but still more the errors and weaknesses, inherent in all völkisch institutions. Though the reading-matter was excellent, the business side was conducted on very inefficient lines. Here also the underlying idea was that a völkisch newspaper ought to be subsidized by contributions from people holding völkisch views, and the fact was ignored that it had to make its way in competition with the others and that it was dishonest to expect the subscriptions of good patriots to make up for the mistakes and inefficiency of the management of the undertaking. I took care to alter these conditions promptly, for I recognised the danger inherent in them. Luck was on my side inasmuch as it brought me a man who, since that time, has rendered incalculable service to the Movement, not only as business-manager of the newspaper, but also as business-manager of the Party.*

*The year 1921 was of further importance by reason of the fact that, as chairman of the party, I slowly but steadily succeeded in putting a stop to criticism and interference by numerous members of committee with regard to various business concerns of the Party. This was important, because we could not get a capable man to take on a job if nincompoops were constantly allowed to butt in, pretending that they knew better, whereas in reality they left only chaos behind them. Then these wiseacres retired, for the most part quite modestly, to seek another field for their supervisory and animating activities. Some men seemed to have a mania for finding fault with everything and were, so to speak, always in a permanent state of pregnancy with magnificent plans, ideas, projects and methods. Naturally, their great aim and ideal was always the formation of a committee which, in its supervisory capacity, would be in a position to poke its nose into the efficient work being done by others. Many of these committee fiends failed to realise that it is offensive and contrary to the spirit of National Socialism*

*Here, therefore, as in so many other cases, it was necessary to appeal to disinterested outsiders who would not be liable to fix their attention on the trees and fail to see the forest. With a little goodwill on their part, they could readily understand a state of affairs which is of the highest importance for our present and future existence. In the first volume of this book I have already expressed my views on the nature, purpose and necessity of tradeunions. There I adopted the standpoint that, unless measures are undertaken by the State (usually futile in such cases) or a new ideal is introduced in our education, which would change the attitude of the employer towards the worker, no other course will be open to the latter, except to defend his own interests himself by claiming his equal rights as a contracting party within the economic sphere of the nation’s existence. I stated further that this would conform to the ideal of a national community, if thereby social injustices could be redressed which would otherwise cause serious damage to the whole social structure. I stated, moreover, that the worker would always find it necessary to undertake this protective action as long as there were men among the employers who had no sense of their social obligations or even of the most elementary human rights, whilst I concluded by saying, that, if such self-defence be considered necessary, its form ought to be that of an association made up of the workers themselves on the basis of tradeunions.*

*The National Socialist Movement, which aims at establishing the National Socialist völkisch State, must always bear in mind the principle that every future institution under that State must be evolved from the Movement itself. It is a great mistake to believe that, by the mere acquisition of supreme political power, we can suddenly bring about a definite reorganisation, from nothing, without the help of a certain reserve of men who have been trained beforehand, especially in the spirit of the Movement. Here, also, the principle holds good that the spirit is always more important than the external form which it animates, since this form can be created mechanically and quickly. For instance, the leadership principle may be imposed on an organised political community in a dictatorial way. But, this principle can become a living reality only when, by means of a gradual process of development from an extremely small nucleus, and by that process of elimination which the hard realities of life continually enforce, there is produced, after the lapse of years, the necessary material from which leaders, capable of carrying the principle into practical effect, are chosen. It is out of the question to think that a scheme for the constitution of a State can be pulled out of a portfolio at a moment’s notice and ‘introduced’ by imperative orders from above. One may try that kind of thing, but the result will always be something that cannot endure, and may even prove abortive.*

*Only the great Weltanschauung for which the Movement is fighting can serve to form by degrees that general attitude which the new era will one day prove to be internally and fundamentally sound and not mere outward show. Hence, the Movement must not only adopt a positive attitude towards the tradeunionist idea, it must go further; it must, by means of practical activity, provide the multitude of its members and adherents with the education requisite for the future National Socialist State. The answer to the third question follows from what has already been said. The National Socialist tradeunion is not an instrument for class warfare, but a representative organ of the various professions and callings. The National Socialist State recognises no ‘classes’ but, from the political point of view, only citizens with absolutely equal rights and equal obligations corresponding thereto. Apart from these, it recognises subjects of the State who have no political rights whatsoever. According to the National Socialist concept, it is not the task of the tradeunion to band together certain men within the national community and thus gradually to transform these men into a class, so as to use them in a conflict against other similarly organised groups within the national community. We certainly cannot assign this task to the tradeunion as such. This was the task assigned to it the moment it became a fighting weapon in the hands of the Marxist. The tradeunion is not naturally an instrument of class warfare; but the Marxists transformed it into an instrument for use in their own class struggle.*

They created the economic weapon which the international Jew uses for the purpose of destroying the economic foundations of free and independent national States, of ruining their national trade and industry and thereby enslaving free nations to serve Jewish world finance, which transcends all state boundaries.*

*The large measure of personal freedom which is accorded to them for their activities is to be explained by the fact that experience has shown that the productive powers of the individual are greater if he is accorded a generous measure of freedom than if he is coerced from above. Moreover, by according this freedom, we give free play to the natural process of selection which brings forward the ablest, most capable and most industrious. For the National Socialist tradeunion, therefore, the strike is a means that may, and indeed must be, resorted to as long as there is not yet a National Socialist völkisch State, but when that State is established it will, as a matter of course, abolish the class struggle between the two great groups made up of employers and employees respectively. For that is a struggle which has always resulted in lessening national production and injuring the national community. In place of this struggle, the National Socialist State will undertake the task of caring for and defending the rights of all parties concerned.*

*The task of the National Socialist tradeunion will be to educate and prepare its members to conform to these ideals, namely, that all must work together for the maintenance and security of our nation and its State, each one according to the abilities and powers with which Nature has endowed him and which have been developed and trained by the national community. Our fourth question was, ‘How can we establish tradeunions for such tasks and aims?’ It is by far the most difficult to answer. Generally speaking, it is easier to establish something in new territory than in old territory which already has its established institutions. It is easy to set up a new business in a district where there is no existing business of the same kind, but it is more difficult if the same kind of enterprise already exists and it is most difficult of all when the conditions are such that only one enterprise of this kind can prosper. In the latter case, the promoters of the new enterprise find themselves confronted not only with the problem of introducing their own business, but also that of how to bring about the destruction of the other business already existing in the district, so that the new enterprise may prosper. It would be senseless to have a National Socialist trade, union side by side with other tradeunions, for the former must be thoroughly imbued with a feeling for the ideological nature of its task and the resulting obligation not to tolerate other similar or hostile institutions.*

*must also insist that it alone is necessary, to the exclusion of all the rest. It can come to no arrangement and no compromise with kindred tendencies, but must assert its own absolute and exclusive right to exist. There were two ways which might have led to such a development: (1) We could have established our own tradeunion and then gradually taken up the fight against the Marxist international tradeunions. (2) We could have joined the Marxist tradeunions in an attempt to imbue them with a new spirit and, with the idea of transforming them into an instrument in the service of the new ideal. For the following reasons, it would have been inadvisable to choose the first method. Our financial situation was still the cause of much concern to us at that time and our resources were very slender. The effects of the inflation were steadily spreading and made the situation still more difficult, because at that time the tradeunions were unable to render their members any tangible service. From this point of view, there was no reason why the individual worker should pay his dues to the union. Even the Marxist unions then existing were on the point of collapse when, as the result of Herr Curio’s inspired Ruhr policy, millions suddenly poured into their coffers. This socalled ‘national’ Chancellor of the Reich should be dubbed the ‘saviour’ of the Marxist tradeunions.*

*He who could have succeeded at that time in overthrowing the Marxist unions to make way for the triumph of the National Socialist corporative idea, which would have replaced this weapon of ruinous class warfare, could have been reckoned as one of the very greatest men our country had produced and his bust installed in the Valhalla at Regensburg for the admiration of posterity. But I knew of no person who could have qualified for such an honour. In this connection we must not be led astray by the fact that the international tradeunions are conducted by men of only mediocre significance. This fact is actually of no importance, for when those unions were founded there was nothing else of a similar kind in existence. To-day, the National Socialist Movement must fight against a monster organisation which has existed for a long time, and has been carefully thought out to the last detail. The assailant must always exercise more intelligence than the defender, if he is to overthrow the latter. The Marxist tradeunionist citadel may be governed to-day by mediocre leaders, but it cannot be taken by assault, except through the dauntless energy and genius of a superior leader on the other side. If such a leader cannot be found it is futile to haggle with Fate and even more foolish to try to make the attempt under a leader wanting in the necessary qualities. Here one must apply the maxim that in life it is often better to leave a thing alone for the time being, rather than try to do it by halves or do it badly, owing to a lack of suitable means.*

*Once people are brought to believe that they can buy a little house with their savings they will devote themselves to the task of increasing their savings and no spare time will be left to them for the political struggle against those who, one way or another, intend one day to secure possession of the pennies that have been hoarded. Instead of participating in the political conflict on behalf of the opinions and convictions which they have been brought to accept, they will now go ‘all out’ for their ‘settlement’ idea and in the end they will fall between two stools. To-day the National Socialist Movement is at the beginning of its struggle. To a great extent it must first of all shape and develop its ideals. It must employ every ounce of its energy in the struggle to have its great ideals accepted, but this effort will not be crowned with success, unless the combined energies of the Movement be devoted exclusively to this struggle. To-day we have a classic example of how the militant strength of a people becomes paralysed when that people is too much taken up with purely economic problems. The Revolution which took place in November 1918, was not brought about by the tradeunions, but was carried out in spite of them, and the German bourgeoisie is not waging a political fight for the future of its country because it believes that that future can be amply secured by constructive work in the economic field.*  

- Page 666 (location ~ 10207-10217)    

*Considered from all these points of view it was not then advisable, nor is it yet advisable, to think of founding our own tradeunion, unless somebody appeared who was obviously called upon by Fate to solve this particular problem. Therefore, there remained only two possible courses—either to recommend our own party members to leave the tradeunions in which they were enrolled, or to remain in them for the moment, with the idea of disrupting them as much as possible. In general, I recommended the latter alternative. There could be nothing against this, especially in 1922–1923, since, during the inflation, the financial gain which the tradeunions derived from the few members who belonged to our, as yet, youthful Movement was negligible, but the damage done to the unions was very considerable since the adherents of National Socialism were their most inveterate critics and consequently exerted a disintegrating influence from within. I entirely discountenanced all experiments which were destined from the very beginning to be unsuccessful. I would have considered it criminal to deprive a worker of some part of his scanty earnings on behalf of an organisation which, according to my inner conviction, could not promise any real advantage to its members.*

*Conditions and persons that may be tolerated and even pass unnoticed in times of peace will not only become the object of aversion when national enthusiasm is aroused, but will even provoke positive opposition, which frequently turns out disastrous for them. In this connection we may recall the spy-scare that became prevalent when the war broke out, when human passion suddenly manifested itself to such a heightened degree as to lead to the most brutal persecutions, often without justifiable grounds, although everybody knows that the spy danger is greater during long periods of peace. Yet, for obvious reasons, it does not then attract a similar amount of public attention. For this reason the subtle instinct of those parasites of the State who came to the surface of the national body as a result of the events which took place in November 1918 makes them feel at once that a movement to restore the freedom of our people, supported by a wise foreign policy and the consequent awakening of national feeling—which would possibly mean the end of their own criminal existence.*

*Undoubtedly a distinction ought to be made between, (1) the responsible administrators of our affairs of State, or rather those who ought to be responsible; (2) the average run of our parliamentary ‘politicians,’ and (3) the bulk of our people, whose sheepish docility corresponds to their want of intelligence. The first know what they want. The second fall into line with them, either because they know what is afoot, or because they have not the courage to take an uncompromising stand against a course which they know and feel to be detrimental. The third just submit because they are too stupid to understand. While the National Socialist German Labour Party was only a small and practically unknown society, problems of foreign policy could have only a secondary importance in the eyes of many of its members. This was the case especially because our Movement has always proclaimed, and must proclaim, the principle, that the freedom of the country in its foreign relations is not a gift that will be bestowed upon us by Heaven or by any earthly powers, but can only be the fruit of a development of our inner strength.*

*Of course, the proviso here is that this fragment is inspired with a consciousness of the solemn duty that devolves upon it, not only persistently to proclaim its spiritual and cultural unity, but also to make the necessary preparations for the military conflict which will finally liberate and re-unite the fragments suffering under oppression. One must also bear in mind the fact that the restoration of lost territories which were formerly part of the State, both ethnologically and politically, must, in the first instance, be a question of winning back political power and independence for the mother-country itself. In such cases, the special interests of the lost territories must be uncompromisingly regarded as a matter of secondary importance in the face of the one main task, which is to win back the freedom of the mother-country. The liberation of oppressed or detached fragments of the population, or provinces of an empire, cannot be accomplished by reason of the wishes of the oppressed or the protests of the bereaved mother-country, but only by resort to force on the part of those sections of the one-time united parent-country which have still more or less retained their sovereign rights.*  

- Page 673 (location ~ 10309-10318)    

*Oppressed territories are not returned to the bosom of their common parent-country as a result of heated protests, but only by the power of the sword. The forging of this sword must be the aim of the domestic policy adopted by a country’s government, whereas it is the object of foreign policy to safeguard the forging process and to gain allies. In the first volume of this book I discussed the inadequacy of our policy of alliances before the War. There were four possible ways of securing the necessary foodstuffs for the maintenance of our people. Of these ways, the fourth, which was the most unfavourable, was chosen: Instead of a sound policy of territorial expansion in Europe, our rulers embarked on a policy of colonial and trade expansion. Their policy was the more mistaken, inasmuch as they presumed that in this way the danger of an armed conflict would be averted. The result of their attempt to sit on two stools at the same time might have been foreseen, they fell between them, and the World War was only the final reckoning which the Reich had to pay for the failure of its foreign policy.*

*For the past three hundred years the history of our Continent has been definitely determined by Britain’s efforts to preserve the balance of power in Europe, thus ensuring the necessary protection of her own rear while she pursued the great aims of British world-policy. The traditional tendency of British diplomacy ever since the reign of Queen Elizabeth has been to employ systematically every possible means to prevent any one Power from attaining a preponderant position over the other European Powers and, if necessary, to break that preponderance by means of armed intervention. The only German parallel to this has been the tradition of the Prussian Army. Throughout the centuries Britain has adopted various methods to achieve her ends, choosing them according to the actual situation or the task to be faced; but the will and determination to use them has always been the same. The more difficult Britain’s position became in the course of history, the more did the British Imperial Government consider it necessary to maintain a condition of political paralysis among the various European States, as a result of their mutual rivalries. When the North American colonies obtained their political independence, it became still more necessary for Britain to make every effort to establish and maintain the defence of her flank in Europe. In accordance with this policy, Britain, after having crushed the great naval Powers, Spain and Holland, concentrated all her forces against the increasing strength of France, until she brought about the downfall of Napoleon Bonaparte and thereby destroyed the military hegemony of France, her most dangerous rival.*  

- Page 676 (location ~ 10360-10372)    

*As early as 1870/71, Britain had, however, decided on the new stand she would take. On certain occasions minor oscillations in that policy were caused by the growing influence of America on the commercial markets of the world and also by the increasing political power of Russia. Unfortunately, Germany did not take advantage of these and, therefore, the original tendency of British diplomacy was reinforced. Britain looked upon Germany as a Power which was of importance commercially and politically and which, partly because of its enormous industrial development, was assuming such threatening proportions that the two countries were already contending against one another in the same sphere. The socalled peaceful conquest of the world by commercial enterprise, which, in the eyes of those who governed our public affairs at that time, represented the highest peak of human wisdom, was just the thing that led British statesmen to adopt a policy of resistance. That this resistance assumed the form of organised aggression on a vast scale was in full conformity with a type of statesmanship which did not aim at the maintenance of a dubious world peace, but aimed at the consolidation of British world-mastery. In carrying out this policy, Britain allied herself with all those countries which were of any military importance and this was in keeping with her traditional caution in estimating the power of her adversary and also in recognising her own temporary weakness. That line of conduct cannot be called unscrupulous, because such a comprehensive organisation for war purposes must not be judged from the heroic point of view, but from that of expediency. The object of a diplomatic policy is not to see that a nation perishes heroically, but rather that it survives. Hence, every road that leads to this goal is justifiable and failure to take it must be looked upon as criminal neglect of duty.*

*The tremendous propaganda which was carried on during the War for the purpose of encouraging the British public to ‘stick it out’ to the end aroused all the primitive instincts and passions of the populace and was bound eventually to act as a drag on the decisions of British statesmen. With the colonial, economic and commercial destruction of Germany, Britain’s war aims were realised. Anything in excess of these aims was an obstacle to the furtherance of British interests. Only the enemies of Britain could profit by the disappearance of Germany as a great continental Power in Europe. In November 1918, however, and up to the summer of 1919, it was not possible for Britain to change her diplomatic attitude, because during the long war she had appealed, more than ever before, to the feelings of the populace. In view of the feeling prevalent among her own people, Britain could not change her foreign policy. Another reason which rendered this impossible was the military strength to which other European Powers had now attained.*

In view of the feeling prevalent among her own people, Britain could not change her foreign policy. Another reason which rendered this impossible was the military strength to which other European Powers had now attained. France had taken the direction of affairs into her own hands and could impose her law upon the others. During those months of negotiation and bargaining the only Power that could have altered the course which things were taking was Germany herself but Germany was torn asunder by a civil war, and had declared through the medium of her socalled statesmen that she was ready to accept any and every dictate imposed on her. Now, in the history of nations, when a nation loses its instinct for self-preservation and ceases to be a possible active ally, it sinks to the level of an enslaved nation and its territory is fated to deteriorate into a colony. The only possible course which Britain could adopt in order to prevent France from becoming too powerful was to participate in her lust for aggrandisement. Actually, Britain had not realised her war aims. Not only had she failed to prevent a continental Power from predominating and thus upsetting the balance of power in Europe, but she had helped to bring about this very situation and in an acute degree. In 1914, Germany, considered as a military State, was wedged in between two countries, one of which equalled, while the other excelled her in military strength. Then there was Britain’s supremacy at sea. France and Russia alone hindered and opposed the excessive aggrandisement of Germany. The unfavourable geographical situation of the Reich, from the military point of view, might be looked upon as another coefficient of security against an exaggerated increase of German power. In the event of a conflict with Britain, Germany’s seaboard, being short and cramped, was unfavourable from the military point of view, whilst her frontiers on land were too extensive and open to attack.*  

- Page 679 (location ~ 10400-10421)    

*A submarine campaign based on France’s long Atlantic coast and on the European and North African coasts of the Mediterranean, would have disastrous consequences for Britain. Thus the political results of the war to prevent the development of German power was the creation of French hegemony on the Continent. The military result was the consolidation of France as the first continental Power and the recognition of American equality at sea. The economic result was the cession of great spheres of British interests to her former allies and associates. Just as Britain’s traditional policy renders the Balkanisation of Europe desirable and necessary up to a certain point, France aims at the Balkanisation of Germany. What Britain has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent any one continental Power in Europe from attaining a position of world-importance. Therefore, Britain wishes to maintain the balance of power in Europe, for this appears to be the prerequisite of British world hegemony. What France has always desired, and will continue to desire, is to prevent Germany from becoming a homogeneous Power. Therefore, France wants to maintain a system of small German States, whose forces would balance one another and over which there would be no central government. This, in conjunction with the French occupation of the left bank of the Rhine, would furnish the conditions necessary for the establishment and guarantee of French hegemony in Europe. The final aims of French diplomacy will inevitably be in perpetual opposition to the ultimate tendencies of British statesmanship. Taking these considerations as a starting-point, anyone who investigates the possible alliances which Germany could form to-day, is forced to the conclusion that the only course open to Germany is a rapprochement with Great Britain.*

*Although the consequences of Britain’s war policy were, and are, disastrous for Germany, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that, as things stand to-day, Britain’s vital interests no longer demand the destruction of Germany. On the contrary, British policy must tend more and more, from year to year, towards curbing France’s unbridled lust for hegemony. Now, a policy of alliances cannot be pursued by bearing past grievances in mind, but it can be rendered fruitful by taking account of past experiences. Experience should have taught us that alliances formed for negative purposes are intrinsically weak. The destinies of nations can be welded together only by the prospect of a common success, of common gain and conquest, in short, a common extension of power for both contracting parties. Our people’s lack of insight in questions of foreign politics is clearly demonstrated by the reports in the daily press, which talk about the ‘pro-German attitude’ of one or the other foreign statesman, this assumed pro-German attitude being taken as a special guarantee that such persons will champion a policy that will be advantageous to our people. That kind of talk is absurd to an incredible degree and reckons with the unparalleled simplicity of the average German Philistine when he comes to talking politics.*

*The necessary condition for linking together the destinies of nations is never mutual esteem or mutual sympathy, but rather the prospect of advantages accruing to the contracting parties. Although it is true that a British statesman will always follow a pro-British and not a pro-German policy, it is also true that certain definite interests involved in this pro-British policy may, for various reasons, coincide with German interests. Naturally, that can be so only to a certain degree and the situation may one day be completely reversed. But the art of the statesman consists in finding at the crucial moment, for the execution of his own vital policy, those allies who must, in their own interests, adopt a similar course. The practical application of these principles at the present time must depend on the answers to the following questions: What States are not vitally interested in the fact that, by the complete abolition of a German Central Europe, the economic and military power of France has reached a position of absolute hegemony? Which are the States that, in consideration of the conditions which are essential to their own existence and in view of the tradition that has hitherto been followed in conducting their foreign policy, envisage such a development as a menace to their own future? One point on which we must be clear is that France is, and will remain, the implacable enemy of Germany.*

One point on which we must be clear is that France is, and will remain, the implacable enemy of Germany. It does not matter what governments have ruled or will rule in France, whether Bourbon or Jacobin, Napoleonist or bourgeois-democratic, clerical Republican or Red Bolshevik, their foreign policy will always be directed towards acquiring possession of the Rhine frontier and consolidating France’s position on this river by disuniting and dismembering Germany. Britain did not want Germany to be a world-power, but France did not want Germany as a Power to exist at all—a very different matter! To-day we are not fighting for our position as a world-power, but only for the existence of our country, for national unity and our children’s daily bread. Taking this point of view into consideration, only two States remain to us as possible allies in Europe, namely, Britain and Italy. Britain is by no means desirous of having a France on whose military power there is no check in Europe, with the result that she might one day pursue a policy which, in some way or other, would inevitably conflict with British interests. Nor can Britain be pleased to see France in possession of such enormous coal and iron fields in Western Europe, which might make it possible for her one day to play a role in world-commerce which might endanger British interests. Moreover, Britain will never be desirous of having a France whose political position on the Continent, owing to the dismemberment of the rest of Europe, seems so absolutely assured that she is riot only able to resume a French world-policy on a large scale, but even finds herself compelled to do*

*In the second place, we must not underestimate the difficulty of changing the opinion of the bulk of the population in former enemy countries, which had been influenced in a certain direction by means of propaganda. When a foreign nation has for years been presented to the public as a horde of ‘Huns,’ ‘robbers,’ ‘Vandals,’ etc., it cannot suddenly be presented as something different, and the enemy of yesterday cannot be recommended as the ally of tomorrow. A third factor, however, deserves greater attention, since it is of essential importance for the establishment of future alliances in Europe. From the political point of view it is not in the interests of Great Britain that Germany should be ruined still more, but such a development would be very much in the interests of the Jews who manipulate the international money-markets. The cleavage between official, or rather traditional, British statesmanship and the controlling influence of the Jew on the money-markets is nowhere so clearly manifested as in the various attitudes adopted towards problems of British foreign policy. Contrary to the interests and welfare of Great Britain, Jewish finance demands not only the absolute economic destruction of Germany, but its complete political enslavement. The internationalisation of our German economic system, that is to say, the transference of our productive forces to the control of Jewish international finance, can be completely carried out only in a State that has been politically Bolshevised.*

The internationalisation of our German economic system, that is to say, the transference of our productive forces to the control of Jewish international finance, can be completely carried out only in a State that has been politically Bolshevised. But the Marxist fighting forces of international and Jewish stock-exchange capital cannot finally smash the German national State without friendly, help from outside. To this end the armies of France will have to attack Germany until the Reich, inwardly cowed, succumbs to the Bolshevist storm-troops of international money-grubbing Jewry. Hence it is that, at the present time, the Jew is the chief agitator for the complete destruction of Germany. Whenever we read of Germany being attacked in any part of the world the Jew is always the instigator. In peacetime as well as during the War the Jewish-Marxist stock-exchange press systematically stirred up hatred against Germany, until one State after another abandoned its neutrality and placed itself at the service of the Allies in the World War, even against the real interests of its own people. The Jewish way of reasoning is quite clear. The Bolshevisation of Germany, that is to say, the extermination of the völkisch and national German intellectuals, and the resultant exploitation of German labour under the yoke of Jewish international finance, is only the overture to the movement for expanding Jewish power on a wider scale and finally subjugating the world to its rule. As has so often happened in the course of history, Germany is the chief pivot of this formidable struggle. If our people and our State fall victims to these oppressors of the nations, who lust after blood and gold, the whole earth will become the prey of that hydra-headed monster.*

*It is certain that Jewry will resort to every possible underhand device in order not only to keep alive the old anti-German feeling among other nations, but to intensify it if possible. It is no less certain that these activities are only very partially in keeping with the true interests of the nations among whom the poison is being spread. As a general principle, Jewry carries on its campaign in the various countries by the use of arguments that are best calculated to appeal to the mentality of the respective nations and are most likely to produce the desired results. Our nation has been so torn asunder racially that it is easy for Jewry in its fight for power to make use of the more or less ‘cosmopolitan’ and pacifist ideas, in short, the international tendencies, which are the result of this disruption. In France, the Jews exploit the well-known and accurately estimated chauvinistic spirit. In England, they exploit the commercial and world political outlook. In short, they always work upon the essential characteristics peculiar to the mentality of each nation. When they have by this means achieved a decisive influence in the political and economic spheres, they can drop the pretence which their former tactics necessitated, now disclosing their real intentions and the ends for which they are fighting. Their work of destruction now goes ahead more quickly, reducing one State after another to a mass of ruins on which they will erect the everlasting and sovereign Jewish Empire. In England, and also in Italy, the contrast between the better kind of native statesmanship and the policy of the Jewish financiers often becomes strikingly evident. Only in France does there exist to-day, in a greater degree than ever before, a profound harmony between the aims of the Stock Exchange, of the Jews who control it and those of a chauvinistic national policy. This identity of purpose constitutes an immense danger for Germany and it is for this very reason that France is, and will remain, by far her most dangerous enemy. The French nation, which is becoming more and more polluted by Negro blood, represents a menace to the existence of the white race in Europe, because it is bound up with the Jewish campaign for world domination. The contamination caused by the influx of Negroid blood on the Rhine, in the very heart of Europe, is in accord with the sadistic and perverse lust for vengeance on the part of the hereditary enemy of our people. This suits the purpose of the cool, calculating Jew, who would use this means of beginning a process of bastardisation in the very centre of the European continent and, by infecting the white race with the blood of an inferior stock, destroy the foundations of its independent existence. France’s activities in Europe to-day, spurred on by the French lust for vengeance and systematically directed by the Jew, are a criminal attack upon the existence of the white races and will one day arouse against the French people a spirit of vengeance among a generation which will recognise racial pollution as the original sin of mankind. As far as Germany is concerned, the danger which France represents, makes it her duty to relegate all sentiment to a subordinate plane and to extend a hand to those who are threatened with the same menace and who are not willing to suffer or tolerate France’s lust for hegemony.*  

- Page 687 (location ~ 10528-10553)    

*Our real political wire-pullers never shared this absurd credulity. The idea of establishing a friendship with France was for them only a means of thwarting every attempt on Germany’s part to adopt a practical policy of alliances. They had no illusions about French aims or those of the men behind the scenes in France. What induced them to take up such an attitude and to act as if they honestly believed that the fate of Germany could possibly be changed in this way, was the cool calculation that otherwise our people might take the reins into their own hands and choose another road. Of course, it is difficult for us, even within the framework of our own Movement, to propose Britain as our possible ally in the future. Our Jewish press has been adept in concentrating hatred against Britain, in particular, and many of our good German simpletons perched on the branches which the Jews had lined to fool them. They babbled about a restoration of German sea-power and protested against the robbery of our colonies. Thus they furnished material which the contriving Jew transmitted to his clansmen in England, to be used there for purposes of practical propaganda. It is high time that even our easily duped bourgeoisie, which loves to dabble in politics, realised that to-day we have not to fight for ‘sea-power’ and the like. Even before the War it was absurd to direct the national energies of Germany towards this end without first having secured our position in Europe. Such an aspiration today reaches that peak of absurdity which may be called criminal in the domain of politics. The success of the Jewish wire-pullers in concentrating the attention of the people on things which are only of secondary importance to-day was often calculated to, drive one to despair. They incited the people to demonstrations and protests while at the same time France was tearing our nation asunder bit by bit and systematically removing the very foundations of our national independence.*

*I have in mind one particular bone of contention of which the Jew has made extraordinarily skilful use in recent years, namely, South Tyrol. The reason why I take up this question here is that I want to call to account that shameless canaille, who, relying on the ignorance and short memory of a large section of our people, simulate a national indignation which is as foreign to the real character of our parliamentary imposters as the idea of respect for private property is to a jackdaw. I should like to state here that I was one of those who, at the time when the fate of South Tyrol was being decided—that is to say, from August 1914 to November 1918—took their place where that country could be most effectively defended, namely, in the Army. I did my share of the fighting during those years, not merely to save South Tyrol from being lost, but also to save every other German province for the Fatherland. The parliamentary highwaymen, the whole gang of party politicians, did not take part in that combat. On the contrary, while we carried on the fight in the belief that a victorious issue to the War would enable the German nation to keep South Tyrol, along with other frontier provinces, these traitors carried on a seditious agitation against such a victorious issue, until the fighting Siegfried succumbed to the dagger-thrust in his back. The inflammatory and hypocritical speeches of the elegantly dressed parliamentarians in the Vienna Rathaus Plat or in front of the Feldherrnhalle in Munich could not save South Tyrol for Germany. That could have been done only by the battalions fighting at the front. Those who broke up that fighting front betrayed South Tyrol, together with all the other provinces of Germany. Anyone who thinks that the South Tyrolean question can be solved to-day by protests, declarations and processions organised by various associations, is either a humbug or merely a German Philistine. It must be quite clearly understood that we shall not get back the territories we have lost if we depend on solemn prayers addressed to Almighty God or on pious faith in a League of Nations, but only by the force of arms.*  

- Page 690 (location ~ 10577-10593)    

*The only question is, therefore: Who is ready to take up arms for the restoration of the lost territories? As far as I myself am concerned, I can state with a good conscience, that I would have courage enough to take part in a campaign for the reconquest of South Tyrol, at the head of parliamentarian storm battalions consisting of parliamentary gasconaders, other party leaders and various Councillors of State. How I should enjoy seeing the shrapnel burst above the heads of those taking part in an ‘enthusiastic’ protest demonstration! I think that if a fox were to break into a poultry-yard his presence would not provoke such a helter-skelter and rush for cover as we should witness in the case of such a fine assembly of ‘protesters.’ The vilest part of it all is, that these talkers themselves do not believe that anything can be achieved in this way. Each one of them knows very well how harmless and ineffectual their whole play-acting is. They do it only because it is easier to babble about the restoration of South Tyrol now, than it was to fight for its preservation in days gone by. Each one plays the part that he is best suited to play in life. In those days we sacrificed our lives. To-day these people are engaged in shouting themselves hoarse. It is particularly interesting to note to-day how Legitimist circles in Vienna preen themselves on their work for the restoration of South Tyrol.*  

- Page 691 (location ~ 10593-10604)    

*Naturally, it is easier to-day to take up the fight for this territory, since the present struggle is waged with ‘the weapons of the mind.’ Anyhow it is easier to join in a ‘meeting of protest’ and talk yourself hoarse in giving vent to the righteous indignation that fills your breast, or stain your finger with the writing of a newspaper article, than to blow up a bridge, for instance, during the occupation of the Ruhr. The reason why certain circles have made the question of South Tyrol the pivot of German-Italian relations during the past few years is quite evident. Jews and Habsburg Legitimists are greatly interested in preventing Germany from pursuing a policy of alliance which might one day lead to the resurgence of a free German Fatherland. It is not out of love for South Tyrol that they play this role to-day—for their policy would turn out detrimental rather than helpful to the interests of that province—but through fear of an agreement being established between Germany and Italy. A tendency towards lying and calumny is inborn in these people, and that explains how they can calmly and brazenly attempt to twist things in such a way as to make it appear that we have ‘betrayed’ South Tyrol. One thing must be made clear to these gentlemen, namely, that South Tyrol was betrayed, in the first place, by every German who was sound in wind and limb and was not at the front during the years 1914–1918 to do his duty to his country. In the second place, South Tyrol was betrayed by every man who, during those years, did not help to reinforce the national spirit and the national powers of resistance, so as to enable the country to carry on the war and keep up the fight to the very end. In the third place, South Tyrol was betrayed by everyone who took part in the November Revolution, either directly by cooperation, or indirectly by a cowardly toleration of it, and thus destroyed the sole weapon that could have saved South Tyrol. In the fourth place, South Tyrol was betrayed by those parties and their adherents who put their signatures to the disgraceful treaties of Versailles and St. Germain. Thus the matter stands, my brave gentlemen, who make your protests only in words. To-day I am guided by a calm and cool recognition of the fact that the lost territories cannot be won back by the glib tongues of parliamentary speechifiers, but only by the whetted sword; in other words, through a fight in which blood will be shed. I have, therefore, no hesitation in saying that now the die is cast, it is impossible to win back South Tyrol through a war. In fact, I would definitely take my stand against such a move, because I am convinced that it would not be possible to arouse the national enthusiasm of the German people to the pitch necessary to carry such a war to a successful issue. On the contrary, I believe that if we have to shed German blood once again it would be criminal to do so for the sake of liberating two hundred thousand Germans, when close at hand more than seven million Germans are suffering under a foreign yoke, while a life-line of the German nation has become a playground for hordes of African Negroes. If the German nation is to put an end to a state of things which threatens to wipe it off the map of Europe, it must not fall into the error of the pre-war period and make the whole world its enemy.*

*More than ever before the poet is right when he says that evil must inevitably continue to breed evil. But even to-day, the fundamentally sound qualities of our nation are not dead, they are only dormant in the depths of the national conscience, and sometimes in the clouded firmament we see the gleam of qualities which Germany will one day remember as the first symptoms of a revival. More than once thousands of young Germans have rallied to a call, resolved, as in 1914, freely and willingly to offer themselves as a sacrifice on the altar of their beloved Fatherland. Millions of men have resumed work, wholeheartedly and zealously, as if no revolution had ever affected them. The smith is at his anvil once again, the farmer is driving his plough and the scientist is in his laboratory—all doing their duty, with the same zeal and devotion as formerly. The oppression which we suffer at the hands of our enemies is no longer accepted, as formerly, with a laugh and a shrug, but is resented with bitterness and anger. There can be no doubt that a great change of attitude has taken place. This change has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and urge to restore the political power and independence of our nation, but the blame for this must be attributed to those who, less in response to a heavensent call than in order to satisfy their own ambition, have been governing our nation since 1918 and leading it to ruin.*

*every type of reading-matter from the child’s story-book to the last newspaper in the country, every theatre and cinema, every pillar where placards are posted and every free space on the hoardings should be utilised in the service of this one great mission; until the faint-hearted cry of ‘Lord, deliver us,’ which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven to-day was transformed, even in the mind of the smallest child, into the ardent prayer, ‘Almighty God, bless our arms when the hour comes. Be just, as Thou hast always been just. Judge now if we deserve our freedom. Lord, bless our struggle.’ All opportunities were neglected and nothing was done. Who can be surprised if our people are not such as they should be or might be, when the rest of the world looks upon us only as its valet, or as an obedient dog that will lick his master’s hand after he has been whipped. Of course the possibility of forming alliances with other nations is hampered by the indifference of our own people, but much more by our government. Their corrupting influence is to blame for the fact that now, after eight years of indescribable oppression, there exists only a faint desire for liberty. Before our nation can embark upon a policy of alliances, it must restore its prestige among other nations, and it must have an authoritative government that is not a drudge in the service of foreign States and the taskmaster of its own people, but rather the herald of the national will.*  

- Page 697 (location ~ 10684-10695)    

*The second objection referred to the difficulty of changing ex-enemy nations into friendly allies. That objection may be answered as follows: The general anti-German psychosis which has developed in other countries through war-propaganda must of necessity continue to exist as long as there is no renascence of the national instinct of self-preservation among the German people. The appearance of such an instinct will transform the German Reich once more into a State able to play its part on the chess-board of European politics and one which the others regard as a worthy partner. Only when the government and the people give evidence of their fitness to enter into an alliance will some Power, whose interests coincide with ours, set about instituting a system of propaganda for the purpose of changing public opinion among its own people. Naturally, it will take several years of persevering and ably directed work to achieve such a result. Just because a long period is needed in order to change the public opinion of a country, it is necessary to reflect calmly before such an enterprise be undertaken. This means that one must not enter upon this kind of work unless one is absolutely convinced that it is worth the trouble and that it will bring results which will bear good fruit in the future. One must not try to change the opinions and feelings of a people by basing one’s actions on the vain cajolery of a more or less brilliant Foreign Minister, but only if there be a tangible guarantee that the new orientation will be really useful. Otherwise, public opinion in the country concerned would be plunged into a state of complete confusion. The most reliable guarantee that can be given for the possibility of subsequently entering into an alliance with a certain State is not to be found in the loquacious suavity of some individual member of the government, but in the manifest stability of a definite and practical policy on the part of the government as a whole, and in public opinion which is solidly of the same mind.*  

- Page 698 (location ~ 10697-10711)    

*Therefore, a nation in such a position as ours will be looked upon as a possible ally only when public opinion and the government are united in the same enthusiastic and openly avowed determination to carry through the fight for national freedom. That condition of affairs must be firmly established before any attempt can be made to change public opinion in other countries which, for the sake of defending their own interests, are disposed to take the road shoulder-to-shoulder with a companion who seems able to play his part in defending those interests—in other words, they are ready to establish an alliance. For this purpose, however, one thing is necessary. Seeing that the task of bringing about a radical change in the public opinion of a country calls for hard work—and many will at first not understand what that means—it would be both foolish and criminal to commit mistakes which could be used as weapons in the hands of those who are opposed to such a change. One must recognise the fact that it takes a long time for a people to understand completely the inner purposes which a government has in view, because it is not possible to explain the ultimate aims of the preliminary steps undertaken with a view to pursuing a certain policy. The government has to count on the blind faith of the masses or the intuitive instinct of the more intellectually developed ruling caste—but since many people lack this insight and political acumen, and since political considerations forbid a public explanation of why such and such a course is being followed—a certain number of leaders in intellectual circles will always oppose new tendencies which, because they are not easily grasped, can easily be regarded in the light of mere experiments.*

*We are not acting sincerely if we indulge in long-range abuse and protests against Britain and Italy and then allow those scoundrels to go scot-free, who, acting in the pay of the enemy, wrested the weapons out of our hands, broke the backbone of our resistance and bartered away the paralysed Reich for thirty pieces of silver. Our enemies are acting in the only way in which they could be expected to act, and we ought to learn a lesson from their behaviour. Anyone who cannot rise to the level of this outlook must reflect that otherwise there would be nothing for us to do except to resign ourselves to our lot, since a policy of alliances would be impossible for all time. For if we cannot form an alliance with Britain because she has robbed us of our colonies, or with Italy because she has taken possession of South Tyrol, or with Poland or Czechoslovakia, then there remains no other possibility of an alliance in Europe except with France which, inter alia, has robbed us of Alsace and Lorraine. There can scarcely be any doubt as to whether this last alternative would be advantageous to the German people; the only matter for doubt is whether he who upholds such opinions is merely a simpleton or an astute rogue. As far as the leaders are concerned, I think the latter hypothesis is true. A change in public feeling among those nations which have hitherto been enemies and whose true interests will, in the future, coincide with ours could be effected, as far as one can foresee, if the internal strength of our State and our manifest determination to secure our own existence made it clear that we should prove valuable allies.*  

- Page 701 (location ~ 10745-10757)    

*Is it conceivable that those who represent the true interests of those nations which may possibly form an alliance with us could put their views into practice against the will of the Jew, who is the mortal enemy of national and independent States? For instance, could the motive forces of Great Britain’s traditional statesmanship smash the disastrous influence of the Jew, or could they not? This question, as I have already said, is very difficult to answer. The answer depends on so many factors that it is impossible to form a conclusive judgment. One thing, at least, is certain: There is, at the present time, one State in which the regime is so firmly established and so absolutely at the service of the country’s interests that the forces of international Jewry could not possibly organise a real and effective obstruction of measures considered to be politically necessary. The fight which Fascist Italy waged against Jewry’s three principal weapons, even if it be to a great extent subconscious (though I do not believe this myself), furnishes the best proof that the poison-fangs of that power which transcends all State boundaries are being drawn, even though in an indirect way. The prohibition of freemasonry and secret societies, the suppression of the international press and the definite abolition of Marxism, together with the steadily increasing consolidation of the Fascist concept of the State—all this will enable the Italian Government, in the course of years, to advance more and more the interests of the Italian people without paying any attention to the hissing of the Jewish world-hydra.*  

- Page 702 (location ~ 10760-10772)    

*It is quite understandable that to-day Britain should re-examine her old alliances and that British statesmen should look anxiously ahead to a day when the cry will no longer be, ‘Britannia rules the waves’, but rather, ‘The seas belong to the United States.’ The gigantic North American State, with the enormous resources of its virgin soil, is much more invulnerable than the encircled German Reich. Should a day come when the fate of the nations will have to be decided, Britain would be doomed, if she stood alone. Therefore she eagerly reaches out her hand to a yellow race and enters upon an alliance which, from the racial point of view is perhaps unpardonable; but from the political standpoint it represents the sole possibility of reinforcing Britain’s world position in face of the tremendous developments taking place on the American continent. Thus, despite the fact that Britain and America fought side by side on the battlefields of Europe, the British Government could not decide to break off the alliance with their Asiatic partner, yet the whole Jewish press opposed the idea of a Japanese alliance. How can we explain the fact that up to 1918, the Jewish press championed the policy of the British Government against the German Reich and then suddenly veered round and began to go its own way. It was not in the interests of Great Britain to have Germany annihilated, but primarily a Jewish interest, and to-day the destruction of Japan would serve British political interests less than it would serve the far-reaching intentions of those who are leading the movement that hopes to establish a Jewish world-empire. While Britain is making every effort to maintain her position in the world, the Jew is laying his plans for its conquest. He already sees the present European States as pliant instruments in his hands, whether indirectly through the power of socalled Western Democracy or in the form of direct domination through Russian Bolshevism. But it is not only the Old World that he holds in his snare; alike fate threatens the New World. Jews control the financial forces of America on the Stock Exchange. Year after year the Jew increases his hold on labour in a nation of one hundred and twenty million souls, but a very small section still remains quite independent and is thus a cause of chagrin to the Jew. The Jews show consummate skill in manipulating public opinion and forge from it a weapon to be wielded in the struggle for their own future. The great leaders of Jewry are confident that the day is near at hand when the promise given in the Old Testament will be fulfilled and the Jews will rule the other nations of the earth. Among this great mass of de-nationalised countries which have become Jewish colonies one independent State could bring about the ruin of the whole structure at the last moment, the reason being that Bolshevism as a world-system cannot continue to exist unless it encompasses the whole earth. Should one State alone preserve its national strength and its national greatness the empire of the Jewish satraps, like every other form of tyranny, would succumb to the force of the national idea.*

*There are two considerations which induce me to make a special analysis of Germany’s attitude towards Russia. These are, that firstly, this may prove to be the most important problem which German foreign policy has to solve, and secondly; this problem is, at the same time, the touchstone which will test the political capacity of the young National Socialist Movement for clear thinking and adopting the right course of action. I must confess that the second consideration has often been a source of great anxiety to me. The members of our Movement are not recruited from circles which are habitually indifferent to public affairs, but mostly from among men who hold more or less extreme views. Such being the case, it is only natural that their understanding of foreign politics should at first labour under the prejudices and inadequate knowledge of those circles to which they formerly belonged by virtue of their political and ideological opinions. This is true not only of the men who come to us from the Left. On the contrary, however harmful may have been the kind of teaching they formerly received in regard to these problems, in very many cases this was, in part, at least, counterbalanced by the sound and natural instincts which they retained. In such cases it is only necessary to substitute a better teaching in place of the earlier influences, in order to transform the instinct of self-preservation and other sound instinct into valuable assets.*  

- Page 707 (location ~ 10826-10837)    

*Let me begin by making the following general remarks. If, by foreign policy, we mean the establishment of relations between any nation and the other nations on this earth, we must admit that the establishment of such relations must depend on certain definite facts. Moreover, we, as National Socialists, must lay down the following principle as regards the essential characteristics of the foreign policy pursued by a völkisch State. The first object of the foreign policy of a völkisch State is to safeguard the existence on this earth of the race which has been organised as an entity by this State, by the establishment of a healthy, enduring and natural proportion between the size and the growth of the population, on the one hand, and the area and resources of its territory, on the other. The only proportion which can be termed ‘healthy’ is one in which the resources of the soil are sufficient, to guarantee the nation’s food-supply. Any condition which falls short of this is none the less unhealthy for the fact that it may endure for centuries or even thousands of years. Sooner or later, this lack of proportion must of necessity lead to the decline; or even annihilation of the people concerned. Only a sufficiently large space on this earth can assure the independent existence of a people. The extent of the territory necessary for the accommodation of the national population must not be estimated in the light of present exigencies or even of its agricultural productivity in relation to the number of the population.*  

- Page 708 (location ~ 10851-10863)    

*National security depends on the political and military strength of a State and this, in turn, depends on its geographical situation looked at from the military point of view. Thus the German nation could assure its own future only by becoming a World Power. For nearly two thousand years the defence of our national interests (as we ought to describe our more or less successful foreign political activities) was a matter of world history. We ourselves have witnessed this, since the gigantic international struggle of the German people for their existence on this earth, and it was carried out in such a way that it has become known in the annals of history as the World War. When Germany entered this struggle it was presumed that she was a World Power. I say ‘presumed’ because in reality she was no such thing. If, in 1914, there had been a different proportion between the German population and its territorial area, Germany would really have been a World Power and, leaving other factors out of count, the War would have ended in her favour.*  

- Page 709 (location ~ 10866-10874)    

*Looked at purely from the territorial point of view, the area of the German Reich is insignificant in comparison with that of socalled World Powers. It would be wrong to cite the case of Britain for the purpose of disproving this statement, because Great Britain, the mother-country, is in reality the great metropolis of the British World Empire, which covers almost one-fourth of the earth’s surface. Among the giant States we must also consider the United States of America, Russia and China. These are enormous territories, some of which have more than ten times the area of the present German Reich. France must also be ranked among these States. Not only because she is constantly increasing the strength of her army by recruiting coloured troops from the population of her gigantic empire, but also because, from the racial point of view, she is rapidly becoming Negroid to such an extent that we can actually speak of the formation of an African state on European soil. The contemporary colonial policy of France cannot be compared with that of Germany in the past. If France develops along the lines it has taken in our day, and should that development continue for the next three hundred years, all traces of French blood will finally be lost in the formation of a Euro-African mulatto state.*  

- Page 710 (location ~ 10882-10891)    

*The former German colonial policy consisted in half measures as did almost everything undertaken at that time It did not aim at the acquisition of new territory for the settlement of German nationals nor did it make any attempt (criminal though this might have been) to reinforce the power of the Reich through the enlistment of black troops. The Askari units in German East Africa represented a small and hesitant step in this direction, but in reality they served only for the defence of the colony itself. The idea of transporting black troops to a European theatre of war— apart entirely from the practical impossibility of doing so during the World War—was never entertained as a proposal to be carried out under favourable conditions; whereas the French, on the contrary, always looked on this as the underlying motive and justification for their colonial activities. Thus we find in the world to-day a number of powerful States which are not only superior to Germany as regards the numerical strength of their population, but which also possess in territorial area the chief support of their political power. Never has the position of the German Reich, judged from the point of view of its area and the size of its population, been so unfavourable in comparison with other States of whilom importance, as at the beginning of its history two thousand years ago and again to-day.*

In that other era we were a young people and we stormed a world of decadent giant States, the last of which was Rome, to whose overthrow we contributed. To-day we find ourselves in a world of great and powerful States among which our own Reich is steadily losing in significance. We must always face this bitter truth with clear and calm minds. We must study the area and population of the German Reich in relation to the other States and compare them throughout the centuries. Then, I know, everyone will realise to his consternation that what I said at the outset is true, namely, that Germany is no longer a World Power, whether she be strong or weak from the military point of view. There is no comparison between our position and that of the other States throughout the world, and this is to be attributed to the ill-fated foreign policy pursued by our governments, to the fact that our foreign policy failed absolutely to pursue a definite aim with unswerving perseverance and also to the fact that we have lost every sound impulse and instinct for self-preservation.*  

- Page 711 (location ~ 10894-10912)    

*It ought also to strive to abolish the contrast between past history and the hopelessly powerless position in which we are to-day. In striving to do so, it must bear in mind the fact that we are the custodians of the highest form of civilisation on this earth, that we have a correspondingly high duty and that we shall fulfil this duty only if we inspire the German people with race-consciousness, so that they will concern themselves not merely with the breeding of dogs, horses and cats, but also care for the purity of their own blood.*  

- Page 713 (location ~ 10920-10923)    

*To the same source we must attribute the organisation of the instinct of national self-preservation and self-defence in the German Army, an achievement which suited the modem world. The transformation of the idea of self-defence on the part of the individual into the duty of national defence is derived from the Prussian State and the new State concept which it introduced. It would be impossible to overestimate the importance of this process. The German nation, which, as a result of racial disintegration, had become the victim of exaggerated individualism, partially regained, through the disciplinary training of the Prussian Army, its capacity for organisation. What other nations still retain of the original herd instinct, we regained, in some measure, for the national community by the artificial means of military training.*

Consequently, the abolition of compulsory national military service— which may have no significance for dozens of other nations—had fatal consequences for us. Let ten generations of Germans be without the corrective and educative effect of military training and delivered over to the evil effects of their racial and, consequently, ideological disintegration and our people would lose the last relics of an independent existence on this earth. The German intellect could then make its contribution to civilisation only through the medium of individuals living under the rule of foreign nations and its origin would remain unknown, while acting as the fertilizing manure of civilisation, until the last residue of Nordic-Aryan blood in us had become corrupted or extinct. It is a remarkable fact that the real political successes achieved by our people during their millennial struggles are better appreciated and understood by our adversaries than by ourselves. Even to-day we wax enthusiastic about an act of heroism which robbed our people of millions of their best racial stock and turned out completely fruitless in the end. The distinction between the real political successes which our people have achieved in the course of their long history and the futile aims for which the blood of the nation has been shed is of supreme importance in determining our policy now and in the future. We National Socialists must never allow ourselves to join in the huzza-ing patriotism of our contemporary bourgeois circles. It would be fatal for us to look upon the developments immediately before the War as in any way binding us in the choice of our own course. We can recognise no obligation devolving on us which may have its origin in any historical phase of the nineteenth century.*  

- Page 714 (location ~ 10946-10967)    

*From the past we can learn only one lesson, and this is that the aim which is to be pursued in our political conduct must be twofold, namely, (1) the acquisition of territory as the objective of our foreign policy and (2) the establishment of a new, uniform and ideologically secure foundation as the objective of our political activities at home.*  

- Page 716 (location ~ 10969-10971)    

*A bad conscience and fear of the strength of our people made up the durable cement which has held the members of that league together, even up to the present moment; nor have they been deceived by us. Inasmuch as our bourgeoisie sets up the restoration of the 1914 frontiers as the aim of Germany’s political programme, each member of the enemy coalition who might otherwise be inclined to withdraw from it, clings to the coalition for fear that he might, having lost the support of his allies, become an isolated object of attack. Each individual State feels itself endangered and threatened by this battle-cry, and that battle-cry itself is absurd, for the two following reasons: Firstly, because there is no available means of extricating it from the twilight atmosphere of club meetings and transforming it into something real. Secondly, because even if it could be carried into effect the result would be so futile that it would not be worth while to risk the blood of our people once again for such a purpose. There can be scarcely any doubt whatsoever that only through bloodshed could we achieve the restoration of the 1914 frontiers.*  

- Page 717 (location ~ 10994-11003)    

*One thing alone is certain, namely, the attempt to restore the frontiers of 1914, even if it proved successful, would lead to a further draining of the blood of our nation to such an extent that no virile men would be left to execute the revolutions and perform the deeds necessary in order to assure the future existence of the nation. On the contrary, under the intoxicating influence of such a superficial success further aims would be renounced, all the more so because socalled ‘national honour’ would seem to be vindicated and new ports would be opened, at least for a certain time, to our commercial development. In the face of all this we National Socialists must adhere firmly to the aim that we have set for our foreign policy, namely, that the German people must be guaranteed that living-space to which it is entitled, and only in pursuance of such an aim can the shedding of the blood of our people be justified in the eyes of God, and future generations of Germans. God—because we are sent into this world to struggle for our daily bread, as creatures to whom nothing is donated and who must be able to win and maintain their position as lords of the earth by virtue of their own intelligence and courage. Germans—in the eyes of further generations of Germans, since the blood of no German should be spilt unless it be to guarantee the lives of a thousand others yet unborn. The territory on which our German peasants will one day be able to rear sturdy sons will justify the sacrifice of the lives of sons of peasants to-day, and though the statesmen responsible for this sacrifice may be persecuted by their contemporaries, posterity will absolve them from the charge of having been guilty of bloodshed and of sacrificing the nation. Here I must protest sharply against those völkisch scribblers who pretend that such territorial extension would be a ‘violation of the sacred rights of man’ and accordingly attack it in their literary effusions. One never knows what are the hidden forces behind the activities of such persons. But it is certain that the confusion which they provoke suits the game our enemies are playing against our nation and is in accordance with their wishes. By the conception of this attitude such scribblers contribute in criminal fashion to weaken from within and to destroy our people’s will to defend their own vital interests by the only effective means that can be used for that purpose, for no nation on earth possesses a square yard of territory by decree of a higher Will and by virtue of a higher Right.*

*Only an imbecile could look on the physical geography of the globe as fixed and unchangeable. Actually, it represents only an apparent interval in a continual evolutionary process due to the certain action of the formidable forces of Nature, and is liable to destruction and transformation tomorrow through still more formidable forces. So, too, in the lives of the nations the confines of their ‘living space’ are liable to change. State frontiers are established by human beings and may be altered by human beings. The fact that a nation has acquired an enormous territorial area is no reason why other nations should for ever acknowledge its right to that territory. At most, the possession of such territory is a proof of the might of the conqueror and the weakness of those who submit to him and this might alone is right. If the German people is cramped in an insufficient living space and is, for that reason, faced with a hopeless future, it is not by the law of Destiny, and the refusal to accept such a situation is by no means a violation of Destiny’s laws. Just as no Higher Power has allotted more territory to other nations than to the German nation, an unjust distribution of territory cannot constitute an offence against such a Power. The land in which we now live was not a gift bestowed by Heaven on our forefathers, but was conquered by them at the risk of their lives. Thus, now, in future our people will not acquire territory and with it the means of subsistence as a favour at the hands of any other nation, but will have to win it by the power of a triumphant sword. To-day we are all convinced of the necessity for regulating our position with regard to France; but our success here will be ineffectual in the vain if the general aims of our foreign policy stop at that. It can have significance for us only if it serves to cover our flank in the struggle for that extension of territory which is necessary for the existence of our people in Europe, for colonial acquisitions will not solve that question.*

*The völkisch Movement must not play the advocate for ether nations, but beg the protagonist of its own nation. Otherwise it would he superfluous and, above all, it would have no right to clamour against the past, for it would then be repeating the action of the past. The old German policy suffered from having been determined by dynastic considerations, the new German policy must not adopt the sentimentally cosmopolitan attitude of völkisch circles. Above all, we must riot form a police guard for the famous ‘small oppressed nations,’ but we must be the soldiers of the German nation. We National Socialists must go still further. The right to territory may become a duty when a great nation seems destined to go under unless its territory be extended, and that is particularly true when the nation in question is not a handful of Negroes, but the Germanic mother of all those who have given culture to the modern world.*

*We are abandoning, once and for all, the colonial and commercial policy of pre-war days and are making a start upon the future policy of territorial expansion, but when we speak of new territory in Europe to-day we must think principally of Russia and the border states under her rule. Destiny itself seems to point the way for us here. In delivering Russia over to Bolshevism, Fate robbed the Russian people of that intellectual class which had once created the Russian State and was the guarantee for its existence. The Russian State as such was not the outcome of the ability of the Slav to establish a constitution, but rather a marvellous example of the constructive political activity of the Germanic element in a race of inferior worth. This is the way in which many mighty empires throughout the world were created. More than once inferior races with Germanic organisers and rulers as their leaders became formidable States and continued to exist as long as the racial nucleus which had originally created the State remained. For centuries, Russia has lived on this Germanic nucleus of its governing classes, but to-day this nucleus has been practically exterminated. The Jew has taken its place. Just as it is impossible for the Russian, on his own, to shake off the Jewish yoke so, too, it is impossible for the Jew to keep this mighty State in existence for any lengthy period of time. He himself is by no means an organising element, but rather a ferment of decomposition. This colossal empire in the East is ripe for dissolution, and the end of the Jewish domination in Russia will also be the end of Russia as a State. We are chosen by Destiny to be the witnesses of a catastrophe which will afford the most striking confirmation of the völkisch theory of race. It is our task, and the mission of the National Socialist Movement, to develop in our people that political mentality which will enable them to realise that the aim which they must set themselves in future could not find fulfilment in the glorious enthusiasm of a victorious campaign fought with the ardour of an Alexander the Great. That the Jew should declare himself bitterly hostile to such a policy is only natural, for the Jew knows better than any other what the adoption of this line of conduct will mean for his own future. That fact alone ought to teach all genuine nationalists that this new orientation is the right one, but, unfortunately, the reverse is the case. Not only among the members of the German National Party, but also in purely völkisch circles, violent opposition is being raised against this Eastern European policy, and in connection with that opposition, as in all such cases, the authority of great men is cited.*

*Not a few Germans, however, especially in the nationalist camp, allowed themselves to be taken in by these pompous Orientals, and in the person of some Indian or Egyptian student they believed at once that they were face to face with a ‘representative’ of India or Egypt. They did not realise that, in most cases, they were dealing with persons who had no backing and who were not authorised to conclude any sort of agreement whatsoever, so that the practical result of any contact with such individuals was nil, unless one chose to enter the time spent thus as a dead loss. I was always on my guard against these attempts, not only because I had something better to do than to waste weeks in such sterile ‘discussions,’ but also because I believed that even if one were dealing with authorised representatives of such nations, the whole affair would be bound to turn out futile, if not positively harmful.*

*There was little to be said either for the alliance with Austria or for that with Turkey. While the greatest military and industrial States of the earth had joined together in a league for purposes of active aggression, a few old and effete States were got together, and with this antique bric-a-brac an attempt was made to face an active world-coalition. Germany has had to pay dearly for that mistaken foreign policy and yet not dearly enough to prevent our incorrigible visionaries from falling into the same error again, for the attempt to bring about the disarmament of the all-powerful victorious States through a ‘League of Oppressed Nations’ is not only ridiculous, but disastrous. It is disastrous because in that way the attention of the German people is again being diverted from real possibilities, which they abandon for the sake of fanciful and fruitless hopes and illusions. The German of to-day is like a drowning man who clutches at any straw. At the same time many of the people who are misled in this way are otherwise highly educated. Whenever some will-o’-the-wisp of a fantastic hope appears these people immediately pursue it. No matter whether it be a League of Oppressed Nations, a League of Nations, or some other fantastic invention, thousands of ingenuous souls will always be found to believe in it. I well remember the childishly incomprehensible hope that Britain’s downfall in India was imminent, which was cherished by völkisch circles in the years 1920–21. A few Asiatic mountebank, who may even have been sincere ‘champions of Indian freedom,’ were then at a loose end in Europe and succeeded in inspiring otherwise quite reasonable people with the fixed notion that the British World Empire, of which India was the hub, was just about to collapse there.*

They never realised that this was wishful thinking, nor did they stop to think how absurd their hopes were, for inasmuch as they expected the end of the British Empire and of Britain’s power to follow the collapse of its dominion over India, they themselves admitted that India was of paramount importance to Britain. It is more than probable that this vital question was not in the nature of a mystery known only to the prophets of German völkisch circles, but also to those in whose hands lay the shaping of British history. It is simply puerile to suppose that in Britain itself the importance of India for the British Empire was not adequately appreciated.*  

- Page 726 (location ~ 11118-11137)    

*Britain will never lose India unless her administrative machinery becomes corrupt as a result of racial contamination (which is at present entirely out of the question in India), or unless she is overcome by the sword of some powerful enemy. Indian risings will never bring this about. We Germans have had sufficient experience to know how hard it is to overcome Britain, and apart from all this, I as a Teuton, would far rather see India under British rule than under that of any other nation. The hopes founded on a legendary rising in Egypt were just as chimerical. The ‘Holy War’ may give our German nincompoops the pleasing illusion that others are now prepared to shed their blood for them. Indeed this cowardly speculation is almost always the father of such hopes, but in actual fact the ‘Holy War’ would soon be brought to a sanguinary conclusion under the withering fire of British machine-guns and a hail of British shells.*

*I, as a nationalist, who estimate the worth of humanity according to racial standards, must, in recognising the inferiority of the socalled ‘oppressed nations’, refuse to link the destiny of my own people with the destiny of theirs. To-day we must take up the same attitude towards Russia. The Russia of to-day, deprived of its Germanic ruling class, is, apart from the secret designs of its new rulers, no suitable ally in the struggle for German liberty. From the purely military point of view, a Russo-German coalition waging war against Western Europe, and probably against the whole world on that account, would be catastrophic for us. The struggle would have to be fought out, not on Russian, but on German territory, without Germany being able to receive from Russia the slightest effective support. The military forces at the disposal of the present German Reich are so small and so inadequate for the waging of a foreign war that it would be impossible to defend our frontiers against Western Europe, Britain included. The industrial area of Germany would have to be abandoned undefended before the concentrated attack of our adversaries, It must be added that between Germany and Russia there is the Polish State, completely in the hands of the French. Should Germany and Russia together wage war against Western Europe, Russia would have to overthrow Poland before the first Russian soldier could be conveyed to a German front, but it is less a question of soldiers than of technical equipment. In this respect our plight during the World War would be repeated, but in a more terrible manner. At that time, German, industry had to be drained to help our glorious allies, and on the technical side Germany had to carry on the war almost alone. In this new hypothetical war Russia, as a technical factor, would count for nothing. We should have practically nothing to oppose to the general mechanisation of the world, which in the next war will assume overwhelming and decisive proportions.*  

- Page 728 (location ~ 11149-11165)    

*Even supposing that a miracle took place and that this war did not end in the total annihilation of Germany, the final result would be that the German nation would be bled white, and, surrounded as she would be by great military States, her real situation would be in no way ameliorated. It is useless to object here that in case of an alliance with Russia we should not think of an immediate war or that anyhow we should have the means of making thorough preparations for war. This is absurd, since an alliance which is not for the purpose of waging war has no meaning and no value. The object of forming an alliance is to wage war. Even though, at the moment when an alliance is concluded, the prospect of war is a distant one, still the idea of the situation developing towards war is the reason underlying the formation of an alliance. It is out of the question to think that the other Powers would be deceived as to the purpose of such an alliance. A Russo-German coalition would either remain a mere scrap of paper (in which case it would have no meaning for us), or the terms of the agreement would be put into effect, and in that case the rest of the world would be forewarned. It would be childish to think that in such circumstances Britain and France would wait ten years to give the Russo-German alliance time to complete its technical preparations. Far from it, the storm would break over Germany immediately. The fact of forming an alliance with Russia would, therefore; be the signal for a new war, the result of which would be the end of Germany.*

*(1) Those who are in power in Russia to-day have no intention of forming an honourable alliance or of remaining true to it, if they did. It must never be forgotten that the present rulers of Russia are blood-stained criminals, that here we have the dregs of humanity which, favoured by the circumstances of a tragic moment, overran a great State, and, in their lust for blood, killed and extirpated millions of educated people belonging to the ruling classes, and that now for nearly ten years they have ruled with a savage tyranny such as has never been known. It must not be forgotten that these rulers belong to a people in which the most bestial cruelty is allied to a capacity for artful mendacity and which, today more than ever, believes itself called upon to impose its sanguinary despotism on the rest of the world. It must not be forgotten that the international Jew, who is to-day absolute master in Russia, does not look upon Germany as an ally, but as a State condemned to the same doom as Russia itself. One does not form an alliance with a partner whose only aim is the destruction of his co-partner. Above all, one does not enter into alliances with people to whom no treaty is sacred, because they do not exist as the upholders of truth and honour, but as the protagonists of lying and deception, thievery, plunder and robbery.*

*(2) The menace to which Russia once succumbed is perpetually hanging over Germany. Only a bourgeois simpleton could imagine that the Bolshevist danger has been overcome. In his superficial way of thinking he does not suspect that here we are dealing with a phenomenon that is due to an urge of the blood, namely, the aspiration of the Jewish people to become the despots of the world. That aspiration is quite as natural as the impulse of the Anglo-Saxon to rule the world, and as the Anglo-Saxon chooses his own way of attaining those ends and fights for them with characteristic weapons, so does the Jew. The Jew follows his own methods, he insinuates himself into the very heart of the nations and then proceeds to undermine the national structure from within. The weapons with which he works are lies and calumny, poisonous infection and disintegration, intensifying the struggle until he has succeeded in exterminating his hated adversary to the accompaniment of much bloodshed. In Russian Bolshevism we must recognise the kind of attempt which is being made by the Jew in the twentieth century to secure dominion over the world. In other epochs he worked towards the same goal, but with different, though fundamentally similar, means. The ambition of the Jew is part and parcel of his very nature. Just as no other people would voluntarily check the instinct to increase in numbers or in power, unless forced to do so by external circumstances or senile decay, so the Jew will never, of his own accord, repress his eternal urge and abandon his struggle for world dictatorship.*

*If nations become impotent or extinct through senility it is because they have failed to preserve their racial purity. The Jews preserve the purity of their blood better than any other people on earth. Thus the Jew pursues his fateful course until he meets another and superior force and after a desperate struggle he who would have stormed the heavens is hurled back once more to the regions of Lucifer. To-day Germany is Bolshevism’s next objective. All the force of a fresh missionary idea is needed to rouse our nation once more, to free it from the toils of the international serpent and stop the process of corruption of our blood from within. The forces of our nation, thus liberated, may be employed to preserve our nationality and in this way,*

*If to-day even völkisch circles are eager for an alliance with Russia, let there but pause to look around in Germany itself, in order that they may realise from what quarter their support comes. Do these people holding völkisch views believe that a policy which is recommended and acclaimed by the Marxist international press can benefit the German people? Since when do they fight with weapons provided by the Jew? One reproach which could be levelled against the old German Reich with regard to its policy of alliances was that it spoiled its relations towards all other States by continual vacillation and by its weakness in trying to preserve world peace at all costs, but one reproach which cannot be levelled against it is that it failed to maintain good relations with Russia. I frankly admit that, before the War, I thought it would have been better if Germany had abandoned her senseless colonial policy and her naval policy and had joined Britain in an alliance against Russia. Thereby Germany would renounce her weak world policy for a determined European policy, with the idea of acquiring new territory on the Continent.*

*The present process of consolidation now being carried out by the great States of the world is the last warning signal to us to look to ourselves, to bring our people back from the realm of visions to the realm of hard facts and point the sole way into the future, which will lead the old Reich to a new era of prosperity. If, in view of this great and most important task before it, the, National Socialist Movement sets aside all illusions and takes reason as its sole guide, the catastrophe of 1918 may turn out to be an infinite blessing for the future of our nation. As a result of the collapse our nation may succeed in adopting an entirely new attitude with regard to foreign policy, and strengthened within by its new Weltanschauung, the German nation may finally stabilise its foreign policy. It may end by gaining what Britain has, what even Russia had, and what enabled France again and again to make analogous decisions which ultimately proved to be to her advantage, namely, a political testament. The fundamental principles of the political testament of the German nation determining the course of its foreign policy shall be as follows: Never permit two continental Powers to arise in Europe.*  

- Page 733 (location ~ 11234-11243)    

*Look upon every attempt to establish a second military Power on the frontiers of Germany, be it only in the shape of a State capable of becoming a military power, as tantamount to an attack upon Germany. Regard it not only as your right, but as your duty, to prevent by every possible means, including resort to arms, the establishment of such a State, and to crush it, should it be established. See to it that the strength of our nation does not rest on colonial foundations, but on those of our own native territory in Europe. Never consider the Reich secure unless, for centuries to come, it is in a position to give every descendant of our race a piece of ground that he can call his own. Never forget that the most sacred of all rights in this world is man’s right to the soil which he wishes to cultivate for himself and that the holiest of all sacrifices is that of the blood shed for it.*

*The future goal of our foreign policy ought to be neither a Western nor an Eastern bias; it ought*  

- Page 736 (location ~ 11277-11277)    

*We must not forget one final fact, namely, that in this case we should not have allies like Turkey or present-day Russia. The greatest World Power on this earth and a young national State would constitute factors in a European struggle which were very different from the corrupt and decadent Powers to which Germany was allied in the last war. As I have already said, there are great obstacles in the way of such an alliance. But was not the formation of the Entente somewhat more difficult? Where King Edward VII succeeded, partly in the face of traditional interests, we must and will succeed, if we are so convinced of the necessity for such a development that we are wisely prepared to conquer our own feelings and carry the policy through. This will be possible only when, driven to action by suffering and distress, we renounce the shilly-shallying foreign policy of recent decades and follow unswervingly a course of action in pursuit of a definite aim. The future goal of our foreign policy ought to be neither a Western nor an Eastern bias; it ought to be an Eastern policy the object of which is the acquisition of such territory as is necessary in order that the German people can live. To carry out this policy we need that force of which France, the mortal enemy of our nation, is now depriving us by holding us in her grip and pitilessly robbing us of our strength. We must, therefore, stop at no sacrifice in an effort to stop France’s striving for hegemony in Europe. As our natural ally to-day we have every Power on the Continent which, like ourselves, feels France’s lust for mastery in Europe unbearable. No attempt to approach those Powers ought to appear too difficult to us, and no sacrifice should be considered too great, if the final outcome would be to make it possible for us to overthrow our most bitter enemy. The minor wounds will be cured by the beneficent influence of Time, once the major wound has been cauterised and closed.*

*After we had laid down our arms, in November 1918, a policy was adopted which, as far as man could foretell, was bound to lead gradually to our complete subjugation. Analogous examples culled from history show that those nations which lay down their arms without being absolutely forced to do so, subsequently prefer to submit to the greatest humiliations and exactions rather than try to change their fate by resorting to arms again. That can be explained on purely human grounds. A shrewd conqueror will always enforce his demands on the conquered only by stages, as far as that is possible. Then he may be reasonably certain that a people who have lost all strength of character (which is always true of every nation that voluntarily submits to the threats of an opponent) will not find in any of these acts of oppression, if one be enforced apart from the other, sufficient grounds for taking up arms again. The more often the conquered nation submits to extortion, the less justifiable in its eyes is the final revolt against a fresh and apparently isolated, but constantly recurring act of extortion, especially if more and greater misfortunes have already been borne in silence and with patience.*

*The fall of Carthage is a terrible example of the slow destruction of a people for which they themselves were to blame. In his Drei Bekenntnisse, Clausewitz expressed this idea admirably and gave it a definite form when he said, ‘The stigma of shame incurred by cowardly submission can never be effaced. The drop of poison which thus enters the blood of a nation will be transmitted to posterity. It will undermine and paralyse the strength of later generations.’ But he added that, on the contrary, ‘even the loss of liberty after a sanguinary and honourable struggle ensures the resurgence of a nation and is the vital nucleus from which a new tree will one day put forth sound roots.’ Naturally, a nation which has lost all sense of honour and all strength of character will not feel the force of such a doctrine, but any nation that takes it to heart will never fall so low. Only those who forget it or do not wish to acknowledge it will collapse. Hence, those responsible for a cowardly submission cannot be expected suddenly to change their line of conduct in accordance with the dictates of common sense and human experience.*

*Seeing that since the war our fate has been in the hands of the Jews, and to-day admittedly so, it is impossible to assume that a defective knowledge of the state of affairs was the sole cause of our misfortunes. On the contrary, we may take it for granted that our people were intentionally brought to ruin. Looked at from this point of view the apparent insanity of our government’s foreign policy is revealed as a piece of shrewd calculating logic, put into effect in order to promote the Jewish idea of a struggle for world-mastery.*

*Since we did not know how to value honour, it has taught us to value liberty through want of bread. Now that the nation has learned to cry for bread, it may one day learn to pray for freedom. Bitter and obvious as the collapse of our nation was in the years following 1918 that was nevertheless the time chosen to persecute with the utmost severity anyone who presumed to foretell what afterwards invariably took place. This was particularly so when it was a question of ‘silencing’ warning voices which were unwelcome because unpleasant. The government to which our people submitted was as hopelessly incompetent as it was conceited, and this was evinced in their*

*France was, however, hindered in this by the fact that as far as Britain was concerned, the War was really only won when Germany was destroyed as a colonial and commercial power, and was reduced to the rank of a second-class State. It was not to Britain’s interest to wipe out the German State altogether. In fact, on many grounds it was desirable for her to have a future rival against France in Europe. France was therefore forced to carry on by peaceful means the work for which the War had paved the way; and Clemenceau’s statement, that for him peace was merely a continuation of the War, thus acquired added significance. Persistently and at every possible opportunity the effort to dislocate the framework of the Reich had to be continued. By perpetually sending new notes that demanded disarmament, on the one hand, and by the imposition of economic levies, on the other, which could be carried out as a result of the process of disarmament, it was hoped in Paris that the framework of the Reich would gradually become unstable. The more the Germans lost their sense of national honour, the more would economic pressure and continued economic distress be effective as factors of political destruction. Such a policy of political oppression and economic exploitation, carried out for ten or twenty years, must it was believed, in the long run steadily ruin and eventually disintegrate the most solid national body.*

*The chance of surviving this struggle depended on whether France could be so far isolated beforehand that in this second conflict, Germany would not have to fight against the whole world, but in defence of Germany against a France that was persistently disturbing the peace of the world. I insist on this point, and I am profoundly convinced that it is inevitable that this second alternative will one day come about. I shall never believe that France will of herself alter her intentions towards us, because they are, at bottom, only the expression of the French instinct for self-preservation. Were I a Frenchman, and were the greatness of France as dear to me as that of Germany is sacred, I neither could nor would act otherwise than a Clemenceau. The French nation, which is slowly dying out, not so much through depopulation as through the progressive disappearance of the best elements of the race, can continue to play an important role in the world only if Germany be dismembered. French policy may make a thousand detours on the march towards its fixed goal, but the destruction of Germany is the end which it always has in view as the fulfilment of the most profound desire and ultimate intentions of the French. Now, it is a mistake to believe that if the will on one side remains merely passive and intent on its own self-preservation, it can hold out permanently against another will which is not less forceful, but is active.*

*As long as the eternal conflict between France and Germany is waged only in the form of a German defence against the French attack, it will never be brought to a conclusion, although Germany will, in the course of centuries, lose one foothold after another. If we study the changes, the line of demarcation of the German language has undergone from the twelfth century up to our day, in the frontier, within which the German language is spoken, we can hardly hope for future success from an attitude and development which have hitherto been so detrimental to us. Only when the Germans have fully realised all this will they cease to allow the national will to live to peter out in passive defence, but will rally it for a last decisive contest with France and a final struggle for the realisation of Germany’s highest aims. Only then will it be possible to put an end to the eternal Franco-German conflict which has hitherto proved so sterile. Of course it is here presumed that Germany sees in the suppression of France nothing more*

To-day there are eighty million Germans in Europe, and our foreign policy will be recognised as rightly conducted only when, after barely a hundred years, there will be two hundred and fifty million Germans living on this Continent, not packed together like coolies and working in factories at the bidding of the rest of the world, but as tillers of the soil and workers whose labours will be a mutual guarantee for their existence.*

*In December 1922, the situation between Germany and France assumed a particularly threatening aspect. France had new and comprehensive oppressive measures in view and needed pledges. Political pressure had to precede economic exploitation, and the French believed that only by making a violent attack upon the central nervous system of German life would they be able to make our ‘recalcitrant’ people bow to their galling yoke. By the occupation of the Ruhr, it was hoped in France that not only would the moral backbone of Germany be finally broken, but that we should be reduced to such grave economic straits that we should be forced to subscribe willy-nilly to the heaviest possible obligations. It was a question of bending and breaking Germany. At first Germany bent and subsequently broke down completely. Through the occupation of the Ruhr, Fate once more reached out its hand to the German people and gave them the chance to arise, for what at first appeared as a heavy stroke of misfortune was found, on closer examination, to be an extremely promising opportunity of bringing Germany’s sufferings to an end. As regards foreign politics, the action of France in occupying the Ruhr really estranged Britain for the first time, Indeed it estranged not merely British diplomatic circles, which had concluded, appraised and upheld the Anglo-French alliance in a spirit of calm and objective calculation, but it also estranged large sections of the British public. The English business-world in particular ill concealed its displeasure at this incredible additional strengthening of the power of France on the Continent. Not only had France now assumed from the military standpoint alone a position in Europe such as Germany herself had not held previously, but she thus obtained control of economic resources which, from the practical point of view, combined her ability to compete in the political world with economic advantages almost amounting to a monopoly.*

*In Italy also the attitude towards France, which, in any case, had not been very favourable since the end of the War, now became positively hostile. The great and critical moment had come when the Allies of yesterday might become the enemies of tomorrow. The fact that events took another course and that the Allies did not suddenly come into conflict with one another, as in the Second Balkan War, was due to the fact that Germany had no Enver Pasha, but merely a Cuno, as Chancellor of the Reich. Nevertheless, the French invasion of the Ruhr opened up great possibilities for the future, not only in the field of Germany’s foreign policy, but also of her internal politics. A considerable section of our people who, thanks to the persistent influence of a mendacious press, had looked upon France as the champion of progress and liberty, were suddenly cured of its illusion. As in 1914 the dream of international solidarity was suddenly banished from the minds of our German working class and they were brought back to the world of everlasting struggle, where one creature feeds on the other and where the death of the weaker implies the life of the stronger, so again in the spring of 1923.*

*If, at that moment, our people had changed not only their frame of mind, but also their conduct, the German Ruhr could have been made for France what Moscow was for Napoleon. Indeed, there were only two possibilities—either to tolerate this new move, in addition to all the rest and to do nothing, or to focus the attention of the German people on, that region of sweltering forges and blazing furnaces, thus firing them with the determination to put an end to this persistent humiliation and to face the horrors of the moment rather than submit to a terror that was endless. Cuno, who was then Chancellor of the Reich, can claim the immortal merit of having discovered a third way, and our German bourgeois political parties merit the still greater glory of having admired him and collaborated with him. I shall first deal as briefly as possible with the second alternative. By occupying the Ruhr, France committed a flagrant violation of the Versailles Treaty. Her action brought her into conflict with several of the guarantor Powers, and especially with Britain and Italy. She could no longer hope that those States would back her in her egotistic act of brigandage. She could only count on bringing the adventure, for such it was at the start, to a satisfactory conclusion by her own unaided efforts.*

*It is true that in scarcely a single instance were our negotiators men of more than mediocre ability. For the most part they justified only too well the sarcastic remark made by Lloyd George with reference to Herr Simon, an ex-cabinet minister of the Reich, that the Germans were not able to choose men of intelligence as their leaders and representatives. But in face of the enemy’s resolute determination to acquire power, on the one side, and the lamentable defencelessness of Germany, on the other, even a genius could have achieved but little. In the spring of 1923, however, anyone who weighed the possibility of seizing the opportunity of the French invasion of the Ruhr to reconstruct the military power of Germany would first have had to restore to the nation its moral weapons, to reinforce its will-power, and to do away with those who had destroyed this most valuable element of national strength. Just as in 1918 we had to pay with our blood for failure to crush the Marxist serpent underfoot once and for all in 1914 and 1915, we have now to suffer retribution for the fact that in the spring of 1923, we did not seize the opportunity then offered us for finally putting a stop to the mischief being done by the Marxist traitors and murderers. Any idea of offering real resistance to the French was pure folly as long as the fight had not been taken up against those forces which, five years previously, had broken German resistance on the battlefields by the influence which they exercised at home.*  

- Page 749 (location ~ 11475-11486)    

*It was veritably a piece of incredible folly to expect that those traitors would suddenly appear as the champions of German freedom. They had no intention of doing so. Just as a hyena will not abandon its carrion, a Marxist will not give up betraying his country. It is beside the point to put forward the stupid argument, that so and so many workers gave their lives for Germany. That is true, but then they were no longer internationally- minded Marxists. If, in 1914, the German working class had consisted of real Marxists, the War would have ended within three weeks. Germany would have collapsed before the first soldier had put a foot beyond the frontier. The fact that the German people carried on the War proved that the Marxist delusion had not yet penetrated deeply, but as the War dragged on German soldiers and workers gradually fell once more under the spell of the Marxist leaders, and to the same degree in which they relapsed, their country was bereft of their services. If, at the beginning of the War, or even during the War, twelve or, fifteen thousand of these Jewish corruptors of the people had been forced to submit to poison-gas, just as hundreds of thousands of our best German workers from every social class and from every trade and calling had to face it in the field, then the millions of sacrifices made at the front would not have been made in vain. On the contrary, if twelve thousand of these malefactors had been eliminated in time, probably the lives of a million decent men, who would have been of service to Germany in the future, might have been saved.*

*It must be remembered, that in many instances a hardy and healthy nation has emerged from the ordeal of bloody civil war, while from peace conditions which had been artificially maintained there often resulted a state of national putrescence that reeked to heaven. The fate of a nation cannot be altered with the velvet glove and in the iron hand should have been used ruthlessly to crush the vipers that battened on the body of the nation. Only after this had been done would preparations for active resistance have had any point. At that time I often talked myself hoarse trying to make clear, at least to the socalled national circles, how much was then at stake, and that by repeating the errors committed in 1914 and the subsequent years we would inevitably meet with the same catastrophe as in 1918. I frequently implored them to let Fate have a free hand and to make it possible for our Movement to settle with the Marxists, but I preached to deaf ears.*

*At that time (I admit it freely) I conceived a profound admiration for the great man beyond the Alps, whose ardent love for his people inspired him not to bargain with Italy’s internal enemies, but to use every possible means in an effort to wipe them out. What places Mussolini in the ranks of the world’s great men is his decision not to share Italy with the Marxists, but to redeem his country from Marxism by destroying internationalism. What miserable pygmies our sham statesmen in Germany appear by comparison with him! How nauseating it is to witness the conceit and effrontery of these nonentities in criticising a man who is a thousand times greater than they, and how humiliating it is to think that this takes place in a country which as recently fifty years ago had a Bismarck for its leader! The attitude adopted by the bourgeoisie in 1923 and the way in which they dealt kindly with Marxism decided from the outset the fate of any attempt at active resistance in the Ruhr. With that deadly enemy in our own ranks it was sheer folly to think of fighting France. The most that could then be done was to stage a sham fight in order to satisfy the German national element to some extent, to tranquillize the ‘seething indignation of the public,’ or dope it, which was what was really intended.*

*Since the German Government of that day were unable to decide on such a heroic step, the only alternative left was to house the first course, namely, to do nothing and let things slide. But, at this crucial moment, Heaven sent Germany a great man in the person of Herr Cuno. He was neither a statesman nor a politician by profession, still less a born politician, but he was a kind of political office-boy who was entrusted with odd jobs. Apart from that, he was more of a business-man. It was Germany’s misfortune that this politicising business-man looked upon politics in the light of business and acted accordingly. ‘France has occupied the Ruhr. What is there in the Ruhr? Coal. Then France has occupied the Ruhr for the sake of its coal!’ What was more natural than that Herr Cuno should hit on the idea of a strike in order to prevent the French from obtaining coal? Then (at least so argued Herr Cuno), they would leave the Ruhr one fine day since the occupation had not turned out to be a paying speculation. Such were approximately the lines along which that outstanding national statesman reasoned. At Stuttgart and in other places he addressed ‘his people’ and his people were lost in admiration. Of course they needed the Marxists for the strike, because the strike had necessarily to be an action undertaken by the workers.*

*Everybody knows that prayers will not liberate a nation, but history has yet to show whether a nation can be set free by ‘downing tools.’ If instead of promoting a paid general strike at that, time, and making this the basis of his ‘united front,’ Herr Cuno had demanded two hours more work from every German, then the swindle of the ‘united front’ would have been over and done with, within three days. Nations do not obtain their freedom by refusing to work, but by making sacrifices. Anyhow, the socalled passive resistance could not last long. Nobody but a man entirely ignorant of war could imagine that an army of occupation could be frightened and driven out by such ridiculous means, and yet this could have been the only purpose of an action for which the country*

*The fundamental question will always be, what are we to do if passive resistance reaches a point where it really gets on the nerves of our opponents and they proceed to suppress it with force and bloodshed? Are we still to resist? If so, then we must, whether we like it or not, submit to severe and bloody persecution, and in that case we shall be faced with the same situation which we should have had to face, had we offered active resistance, in other words, we should have to fight. Therefore, socalled passive resistance would be logical only if supported by the determination to continue this resistance, if necessary, either in an open fight or by means of guerilla warfare. Generally speaking, such a struggle is never carried on, except in the conviction that success is possible. A besieged stronghold, hard pressed by the enemy, surrenders, to all practical purposes, at that moment when it is forced to abandon all hope of relief, especially if, in such a case, the defenders are attracted by the promise of life instead of probable death. Let the garrison of a citadel which has been completely encircled by the enemy once lose all hope of deliverance, and the spirit of the defenders is broken immediately. That is why, if one considers the consequences to which it must inevitably have led, if it was to prove successful, passive resistance in the Ruhr had no practical meaning unless an active front had been organised to support it.*

*They had all hoped that—if not openly, then at least secretly—the necessary measures would be taken to make this insolent French invasion a turning-point in German history. In our ranks also there were many who counted on the intervention of the Reich Army. That conviction was so ardent that it exerted a decisive influence on the conduct and especially on the training of innumerable young men. But when the disgraceful collapse actually took place, and, after millions of German money had been spent in vain and thousands of young Germans who had been foolish enough to trust in the promises made by the rulers of the Reich had been sacrificed, the Government capitulated in the most humiliating way, public indignation at such a betrayal of our unhappy nation blazed forth. Millions, of people now became fully convinced that Germany could be saved only if the whole prevailing system were destroyed root and branch. There never had been a more propitious moment for such a solution. On the one hand, an act of high treason had been committed against the country, openly and shamelessly. On the other, a nation was, economically speaking, delivered over to slow starvation. Since the State itself had trampled upon all precepts of faith and loyalty, made a mockery of the rights of its citizens, rendered the sacrifice of millions of its most loyal sons fruitless and robbed other millions of their last penny, it could no longer expect anything but hatred from its subjects.*

*“Let the judges of this State condemn us for our conduct at that time; History, the goddess of a higher truth and a finer justice, will smile as she tears up their verdict and will acquit us of all guilt.” But History will then also summon before its own tribunal, those who, invested with power, have trampled on law and justice, condemning our people to misery and ruin, and who, in the hour of their country’s misfortune, took more account of their own ego than of the life of the community. I shall not here relate the history of the events leading up to November 8th, 1923, and ending with that date. I shall not do so, because I cannot see that this would serve any beneficial purpose in the future and also because no good could come of opening old sores that have only just healed.*
