# El Chapo, de facto   

Unmatched lyricism and wordplay that will have your head spinning with every play.  Frank Ocean's music provides one with such unique playback experience when listening to his music due to his great ability of embracing femininity and masuclinity. The sheer fidelity of each bar, note, and pause kindly bakes this delicate ear croissant ready for your consumption.

*No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it   
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho  
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute  
That's why I kissed you  
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down*      
[**Thinkin Bout You**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-thinkin-bout-you-lyrics)  

*Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission   
(Sierra Leone)  
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different  
Shit feelin' too good to me  
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight  
(Sierra Leone)*  
[**Sierra Leone**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-sierra-leone-lyrics)    


*You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'  
To get the fixing that you're itching for  
Your family stopped inviting you to things  
Won't let you hold their infant*  
[**Crack Rock**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-crack-rock-lyrics)  

*Monks in the mosh pit  
Stage diving Dalai Lama  
Feet covered in cut flowers  
They mosh for enlightenment  
Clean chakra, good karma*

*Speaking of the, don't know what got into people  
Devil be possessin' homies  
Demons try to body-jump  
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?*  
[**Nikes**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-nikes-lyrics)  

*That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by  
That's a pretty long third gear in this car  
Glidin' on the five  
The deer run across, kill the headlights*  
[**Skyline To**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-skyline-to-lyrics)  

  
*Bad luck to talk on these rides  
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float*  
[**White Ferrari**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-white-ferrari-lyrics)  
  
  
*The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here*

# Endless  

{{< figure src = "https://i.redd.it/e22wgpky1jc21.png" width = "800px" >}}  

  
A continuous playback masterpiece  

*'Cause when you're at your best you are love  
You're a positive motivating force within my life  
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why  
Let me know, let me know*  
[**At Your Best (You Are Love)**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-at-your-best-you-are-love-lyrics)   

*U-N-I-T-Y, Neptunes and peace signs  
Chiraq, Palestine like  
Iberville 1995  
You'd think that was airstrikes on outside  
I put refugees in my villa, play kids the Fu-Gee-La  
All this space Atlanta*  
[**U.N.I.T.Y**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-u-n-i-t-y-lyrics)  


Boys in the building give me updates like they know the weather  
If you ain't in the streets you can't see the sky, I'm out here  
I could see the sky and it's paradise  
On the regular  
[**Slide on Me**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-slide-on-me-lyrics)  

Is it a deathwish to doze off helpless?  
Leave myself at the mercy of you  
At the mercy, of you  
And I be needing my sleep in peace  
Need to trust you  
At the mercy of you  
[**Impietas + Deathwish (ASR)**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-impietas-deathwish-asr-lyrics)  



Twin peaking, highs and lows, we shaded off and on  
Bygones but we're still here, ride around in my two wheels  
I love the way you make me feel  
(What happens to me)  
Bet you wish you was me  
[**Rushes**](https://genius.com/Frank-ocean-rushes-lyrics)  


# Lots of Love (LOL)  

I have LOL for Frank and his ability to use broad strokes lyrics to convey very relatable emotional experiences mixed with feminine and masculine features. My favourite album, Endless, is one I still manage to play from start to finish on repeat while I work, cook, run, bike or sit to enjoy it.
