# What happened?  

Well, the short interest figures vary based on what others might report online as exaggerated numbers. However, in this [report](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) you can see that the outstanding shares (100 mil) had a peak short interest around 70mil whih is pretty substantial. Needless to say, some sides of a zero-sum trade like this one will always have losers. Plotkin, Melvin Capital CEO (trade loser), says that [redditors "exploited" an opportunity around short interest.](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/02/18/melvin-capitals-plotkin-at-gamestop-hearing-reddit-traders-exploited-opportunity-around-short-interest.html) However, it's the same degree of exploitation in which the firm took part. In simple terms, think about this way. If you can't:  
- Sell a car you don't own  
- Sell a home you don't own   
- Sell a boat you don't own  
- Sell almost any asset you don't own   

How is it that you can have the broker borrow a stock on your behalf as you sell a stock short to expect to buy it back at a lower price at a later date?  This trivializes the issue, but highlights why exactly something like this is wreckless behaviour for those who wish to take on this side of a trade.  

Be warned, the highest reward one can get on a short trade is 100%, but if the selected asset increases you can lose a sum larger than that which you staked originally.
