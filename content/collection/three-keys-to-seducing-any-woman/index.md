*The key moment of any SDB happens with the appearance of the triggering stimulus (stressor), announcing the start of another loop. It’s here that you need to be aware that a choice is available to you – that you’re looking at a fork in the road and not a closed track. All the power to break the SDB lies in your awareness that this choice point exists. The different path may turn out to be an improvement, or maybe not. Not important. It is the act of selecting a new option that wil final y begin to destroy this repeating behavior. It’s like a movie on DVD where you can select an alternate ending if you don’t like the one you saw at the theater. The presentation of an option gets the wheels inside your head turning in a new fashion and this can quickly defeat an intractable fear that you’ve always been living with. It’s simply time to select a new ending for yourself!*

*In the heat of the moment, when you’re al frazzled at work and thoughtlessly reaching for that cream donut for instance, you have to recognize that a moment of choice is at hand... stop and contemplate a different choice. Chew a stick of gum instead. Go splash cold water on your face. The replacement behavior is unimportant as long as it leads to a different sort of result than the usual “donut chomping” (although switching from cream to jel y wasn’t exactly what I had in mind...) This is how you massage an SDB into submission... a little at a time using awareness and an open mind. And since most SDB’s have some component of fear working at their core, learning this technique is an effective way to wrestle down every one of your worst fears one by one.*

*It’s perfectly natural and normal to sometimes feel a little bit unsure of how your actions are being observed and possibly judged by others, but true shyness is a painful y self-focused sensation where you feel as if you are being exposed to the critical scrutiny and judgement of everyone else al of the time, relentlessly. Shyness is a cautionary mode we retreat into whenever we have insufficient data about the individuals surrounding us and are overly concerned about how we are appearing to them. This is especial y true of course when men find themselves in the presence of beautiful, intimidating women. You should understand why you need to make every effort to avoid acting shy whenever you can. The reason why shyness is destructive to your ability to pursue social opportunities may seem obvious, but the true reason may actual y surprise you... Most people simply don’t like shy people.*

*When women prattle on with their high-minded bul shit about wanting to find "nice guys", what they're real y saying is that they want a guy who makes them feel safe, but not in a way that robs him of his sexual juice. And that means you need to draw a line in the sand, like so... For instance, there are certain topics that a woman may try to bring up which you must immediately stonewall and simply refuse to engage her in. That’s because these subjects are best discussed with a non-intimate friend rather than a potential lover. Whatever else you do, resist the temptation to al ow her to start making “chick chat” with you like she would attempt with one of her girlfriends! One thing that’s certainly off limits is you listening to her bitch about her ex- (or worse, current! ) boyfriend or husband. This is not something that you, as her possible new boyfriend, want to know anything about. Let her go ahead and gab on the phone al she wants about that asshole to one of her girlfriends, but not to 13 you. You are not her new gay buddy! Also make sure that she understands she is not free to confide in you things that paint her in a bad light as wel , things such as gross personal habits, failed relationships, mundane medical problems and the like.*

*I believe that it al boils down to this one basic idea: women are attracted to men whom they sense hold a relatively impressive ranking on an invisible scale of Male Status. Perhaps more crudely it could be cal ed dominance. But dominance over what? Over some slice of the other men in their world. This scale reflects how a guy has fared in competition with his fel ow males in terms of strength, wealth, accomplishment, notoriety, etc. And the higher up this scale you appear to be, the more likely you are to show up on the radar of the women around you! Male peacocks impress with their huge feathery plumes, male moose with their grand rack of antlers... and human males? Wealth, authority, fame and/or athletic strength usual y do the trick of attracting the mating interest of surrounding females. But the important thing to remember if you’re a guy who possesses little or none of these qualities is that, when it comes to humans, perception is reality.*

*Look, sexual attraction is primal, it occurs on a profoundly subconscious level in both sexes. Hel , it's mostly unconscious if you get right down to it. Attraction may be supported by the rational part of the mind, but rarely overridden by it. On a purely instinctual level men are attracted to women who exhibit visual signs of youthfulness. Big eyes and smal chin, 70% hip-to-waist ratio, smooth skin, etc.etc. Al of these are signals of youthfulness, and thus a healthy child-bearing potential for the female. This mating calculus is much different for women because male virility is not so closely linked to youth as female fertility is. Men can sire children with ease far into middle age, and even advanced age. So women perform a quick, subconscious appraisal of a man that grades him for his potential to help her raise his offspring. She must consider if a man is likely to remain loyal to his family, so trustworthiness is a big issue. This is why married men are so attractive to some women – because they've demonstrated a wil ingness to team up with a woman by making a legal y binding commitment to her (even if it's a misguided one).*

*Three – A Cool, Relaxed Flirt. The high status male is calm and in control around women. Advertise your delight in meeting her with crisp eye contact and a gentle smile, and try to keep al flirting subtle and mysterious. Show that you’re intrigued by her feminine charm, but communicate this non-verbally as much as possible through the use of open body language and a mischievous gleam in your eye. A woman’s romantic universe is defined by the eye contact that she receives from the men around her, so this is one skil that you must cultivate for yourself in order to become adept at gaming women.*
