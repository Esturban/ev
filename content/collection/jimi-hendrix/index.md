# Extraordinary  

Few words can describe Jimi's ability to shred. The history that got him to fame was three parts a humble upbringing and one part passionately obsessed to become a musician like the ones he looked up to.  It could be Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, Jeff Beck or Robert Fripp, all of these artists who inspired Jimi later became inspired by him or envious. Jimi's becoming a rock legend shocked so many through sheer hardwork and effort that it's hard to believe he began with an old broken single string guitar at 14 and took 18 months to get the other strings. Aspirations interrupted by responsibility, Jimi was a counterculture revolutionary with respect for the military and love for his craft. His history is a reminder of loving what you do and never relenting from what you want.

Don't know if I'm coming up or down

Whatever it is, that girl put a spell on me"*

It takes about a half a day to get there

*"Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind"*

# Focus on your strengths  

Jimi never liked his singing voice and was often quoted saying "I can't sing a song". But, he had so much more to offer the world besides his ability to sing. He had a childhood stutter and would ocassionally come out when he was nervous, but that wouldn't impede his ability to rip guitar as he so fearlessly could. People rarely start out as an all-star, but those who want something bad enough will deliberately practice to the point they need to become legendary. If Jimi was so worried about his singing that he instead never became an artist then we may never have been graced by such a timeless artist.
