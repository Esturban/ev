### 1. Turn off your cell phone  

Cell phones are miniature slot machines designed to reward you with hits of dopamine when you need your fix.  They celebrate you, punish you, make you happy, and can make you sad.  You can take control of your emotions today by simply putting down the phone.  The solution is simple, not easy.  

### 2. Consider your actions and who they ultimately benefit  

I recently bought a Toyota RAV4 and it seems to have a sticky pedal like the ones recalled. I have the opportunity to react with various different outcomes. I could:  
- Buy another RAV4 (Might run into the same issue, great for Toyota)  
- Return my RAV4, shop around (Might go without a car)  
- Smash Toyota dealers with accompanying RAV4 purchasers (Burns down the town for arbiters of chaos)  
- and more... 

The reactions are limitless, but you can choose who the outcomes benefit.  

### 3. Recall the issues that affect you personally

The people who have told you that the world is on fire lack moral principles and are comfortable lying to your face about your most urgent issue... 

*COVID-19!*  
*#georgefloyd*  
*#mikebrown*   
*#peacewithiran*  

Deception is often used to get your attention and distract you from your goals ([*like the cellphone*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InU87p6ayVo)).  Consider your financial health, education, and homestead stability over becoming useful on other people's chessboards.  


To learn more about the process of how recent events cascade into nationwide demonstrations, the interview below provides a blueprint.
