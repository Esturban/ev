*The first section of this book is about flattery. Fashions come and go, but people will always want to be considered good-looking, suc- cessful, smart, athletic, and honorable (in that order). After a session with you, your prey should feel he is all those things. Your compliments needn’t be true; they need only be plausible. The most effective flattery, of course, is that which seems unintended. This section will show you how to drop such “accidental” compliments. Many of the suggested behaviors do not constitute charm in the classical sense: they will not make people marvel at your presence and wit. But they will make people feel better about themselves, and those people will then associate that feeling with you, which is the ultimate goal of being charming anyway. One of the secrets to being charming*

*Abraham Lincoln once said that tact is the ability to describe others as they see themselves. Take this advice a step further: tell your prey he’s better than he thinks he is. Having one’s ego inflated is a heady experience, and if you can provide it on a consistent basis, your prey will eventually see you as the source of all things appealing and wonderful. Your prey will be far more grateful about being praised for his weak points than his strengths. A champion wrestler does not need to be told what a good athlete he is; he will be infinitely more grateful if you tell him he’s smart, or something else he rarely hears. Do make your compliments credible, for otherwise it will seem you’re mocking him.*

*“I’m jealous. If I looked like you, I’d have a new girlfriend every day.” “What did you ever do to deserve to be that handsome? Nobody deserves that.”*  

- Page 15 (location ~ 220-221)    

*Don’t sound as if you’re trying to give your prey a compliment; it will sound calculated and therefore less sincere. Sound as if you’re truly jealous (but without the rancor) as you say, “Man, I wish I looked like you. Sometimes I think your looks are wasted on you.” “You’re a handsome fool. If you had any idea how many women have had crushes on you!” Even if your target is not attractive, you can usually find at least one feature that is praiseworthy. (“I wish I had an intelligent forehead like yours. I look like a cretin by comparison.”) These compliments work just as well for women, of course, with slight changes. (“If I looked like you, I’d just marry a billionaire.”)*

*SITUATION: You catch your prey looking in the mirror. What do you say? STIFF: Looks away quickly, as if he’s caught him doing something shameful. BOOR: “You gotta be the vainest guy I know.” CHARMER: (shrugging) “I don’t blame you. If I looked like you, I’d probably allot an hour a day just to admire myself.”*

*Women are, by reputation, extremely sensitive about their ages—but don’t make the mistake of thinking that men are any less sensitive. So whether you’re trying to charm a man or a woman, your job is to make your prey feel younger. The rule of thumb when guessing somebody’s age is that, up to the age of eighteen, you add a couple years, then, from eighteen to twenty-five you guess correctly. At thirty, you subtract five, past the age of forty you subtract ten, and from sixty-five on, you subtract fifteen. Your prey is probably not such a fisherman that he’ll ask you to guess his age. So when the subject comes up (e.g., when you see his driver’s license, or when he mentions the year he graduated from col- lege), just act surprised: “Oh, I thought you were younger.” Or say, “I guess you’re younger biologically than chronologically.” Or just express disbelief: “No way you’re forty-three.” Then, add, “Wow! You’re ancient,” which, in context, is a roundabout compli- ment. Shake your head: “You’re a medical miracle.” If your prey is thirtyish, ask, “Do you get carded when you go to bars?” If you know you’re the same age, comment, “It must be boring for you to hang out with an old coot like me.”*  

- Page 16 (location ~ 235-247)    

*If your prey is literate enough to be familiar with The Picture of Dorian Gray, say, “You must have a picture in your attic that ages while you stay young.” Or, “You must have sold your soul to the Devil. What’s it like hav- ing to do his bidding?” Say, “You must be taking a human growth hormone or sheep’s glands or something.” If you want to ask him about something he did earlier, don’t ask, “What sport did you do when you were young?” This usage of the word “young” implies that he is no longer young. Ask instead, “… when you were a kid?” Not being a “kid” is far easier to digest.*  

- Page 17 (location ~ 253-259)    

*SITUATION: Your prey tells you he’s fifty. STIFF: “Oh.” BOOR: “That all?” CHARMER: “No way! What do you do, swim in the fountain of youth every day?”*  

- Page 18 (location ~ 262-264)    

*Tolstoy once said that although people never think they have a suffi- cient amount of money, everyone seems to think they have a suffi- ciency of intelligence. In fact, most of us think we’re smarter than everyone else, since we agree with our own opinions more than anyone else’s. Nonetheless, since we’re all proven wrong from time to time, we harbor doubts, so we look for proof that we are indeed smarter than everyone else. (This is why we so enjoy those lists of dumb mistakes others make—they reassure us of our own intelligence.) Tell your prey, “You’re one of the smartest people I know.” Virtu- ally everybody in the top half—and bottom quarter—of the IQ bell curve is dumb enough to believe this.*  

- Page 18 (location ~ 264-271)    

*SITUATION: Your prey confesses that his IQ was tested at ninety- three. STIFF: Gives him an unintentionally disgusted look and shrugs. BOOR: Nods as if longtime opinion has been confirmed and says, “That sounds about right.” CHARMER: “Well then, whatever it is that sets you apart can’t be captured in an ordinary test.”*  

- Page 19 (location ~ 282-285)    

*If your prey is not particularly intelligent, you can still make him feel as if he is. Ask questions you know he has the answer to, then act impressed with his response. He’ll get that little zing of satisfaction for having known the answer, and you can reinforce his feeling of superiority by saying, “I had a feeling you’d know that,” as if you consider him the ultimate source of all information. Let’s say your prey is a baseball nut. Ask him who won the World Series in 1986, and when he demonstrates his knowledge by telling you the Mets, try to look as happy as you would if your most cherished opinion about your own high intelligence has been confirmed. Exclaim, “I swear, you’re a walking encyclopedia!” No matter that this encyclopedia begins and ends at B-a-s-e-b-a-l-l; look at him as if he has B-r-i-t-a-n-n-i-c-a stamped across his forehead.*  

- Page 19 (location ~ 286-293)    

*SITUATION: You ask your prey who his preferred candidate is in the upcoming Presidential election. He gives you his choice, but then adds that it’s just another subjective political opinion, no better or worse than anyone else’s. STIFF: Nods. BOOR: “That’s true.” CHARMER: “See?! Just the fact that you would say that shows what good judgment you have!”*  

- Page 20 (location ~ 305-308)    

*If you don’t go with his advice, explain why, but tell him how his advice almost made you change your mind. He’ll still glow. You’ve got nothing to lose; you might even get some good advice.*  

- Page 21 (location ~ 319-321)    

*SITUATION: You’ve made up your mind to marry Sally. Now you’re sharing the news with your prey. STIFF: “Sally and I are getting married.” BOOR: “I’m getting married. Lotta girls around here gonna be wear- ing black armbands.” CHARMER: “John—I’ve decided to ask Sally for her hand, but I didn’t want to go ahead and actually do it till I got your blessing.”*  

- Page 21 (location ~ 322-326)    

*If you’re not good at faking laughter, use words instead: “I’ll have to remember that one,” as if you can’t wait to repeat that particular gem. “I could be your Boswell.” Use this one only if he’s literate enough to be familiar with the fellow who recorded Samuel Johnson’s witti- cisms; most will think you’re referring to the Charlie’s Angels mentor. “You could write for the movies.” “The ability to defuse tension with a joke is really a gift from God.” “Listening to you is sort of like being in a Noel Coward play.” “You could really do some damage if I were trying to keep a straight face at some solemn occasion.”*  

- Page 22 (location ~ 326-333)    

*SITUATION: Your prey makes a weak attempt at wit. STIFF: Manages a pained half-smile. BOOR: “You are unbelievably lame.” CHARMER: “How do you come up with this stuff? Really, had you thought of that before and waited for the right moment, or did it just occur to you?”*  

- Page 22 (location ~ 334-336)    

*Saying you have a lot in common means, on a very subtle level, that you want to be like this other person. This is somewhat akin to the way people always see their resemblance to better-looking, but never worse-looking, people. No one ever says, “Wow—we’re so alike—we’re both petty, vindictive, jealous people!” Express pleased surprise at your “discovery” of your prey: “You know, I never expected to make a real friend in this place.” The feeling you want to give him is that each of you has just discov- ered his long lost twin. One of the best ways to make your prey feel you have a lot in com- mon is to pretend you are thinking what he is saying. So the next time he makes a casual observation, exclaim, “Wow! That’s just what I was thinking!”*  

- Page 23 (location ~ 345-352)    

*At his next observation, cry out, “You always seem to say exactly what’s on my mind!” Then give him a look of awe and wonderment, and say, “You know, we really think alike.” (It’s always reassuring, as well as fun, to meet someone who thinks the way you do.) The next time, cry out, “You must be clairvoyant! This is amaz- ing—it’s as if you read my mind!”*  

- Page 24 (location ~ 354-357)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says his favorite movie is The Godfather. STIFF: “I’ve seen that.” BOOR: “Everybody in the world loves that stupid movie. Buncha Guinea gangsters. Who cares?” CHARMER: (warmly) “That’s one more thing we have in common! I love The Godfather!”*  

- Page 24 (location ~ 362-365)    

*The ability to bestow happiness is in fact a tremendous power, so telling your prey he makes you feel good is a tremendous compliment. Another way to say this is, “I don’t know why, but being around you always puts me in a good mood.” (The “I don’t know why” makes the compliment seem unintentional.) Or, “Being around you always seems to take the edge off my bad mood.” “When I see you, I somehow just know I’m going to be enjoying myself.” Another way to say this is, “We always seem to have the most inter- esting conversations.” The fact is, when you’re talking about some- thing you’re really interested in, you’re happy. A more direct way to say it is, “You seem to be one of the few people who restore my faith in humanity.”*  

- Page 24 (location ~ 366-373)    

*SITUATION: After an enjoyable evening, your prey says, “That was fun.” STIFF: “It was.” BOOR: “I was in good form, wasn’t I?” CHARMER: “It’s strange, but being around you is sort of like a drug—it just seems to give me this high.”*  

- Page 25 (location ~ 373-376)    

*Cover His Ears When complimenting your prey to a third person, lightly place your hands over your prey’s ears—you’re only pretending you don’t want him to hear. This will make it seem as if it is not your intention to flatter, which of course makes it even more flattering. If your prey asks what you’re doing when you place your hands over his ears, just reply, “I don’t want your head getting too big.” The kind of flattery you deliver under these circumstances has to be somewhat sexy. It would be anticlimactic to place your hands over his ears, then just say, “John was a big help cleaning up after the storm.” Much preferable to say something like, “John has all the local girls after him. If he had any idea how many of these girls are just crazy about him …”*  

- Page 25 (location ~ 377-384)    

*SITUATION: Your prey, who is sitting in front of you, is being praised for his intelligence by a group of people. What do you say? STIFF: Just nods. BOOR: Slaps him on the back of the head like a reproving father and says, “If he’s so smart, how come he’s not rich?” CHARMER: Covers his ears and says, “Don’t you guys know how often he hears that? Everyone in the world knows how smart he is, if he hears it one more time his head won’t be able to fit through that door.”*  

- Page 26 (location ~ 391-396)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks what it is about him that you like. STIFF: “I don’t know … You’re a nice guy, I guess.” BOOR: “Nothing, really.” CHARMER: “It’s hard to say … All I know is that you’re one of a kind.”*  

- Page 27 (location ~ 412-414)    

*Comparisons are the form of flattery with the highest value: it’s good to be good, but it’s better to be better. As Gore Vidal once noted, “It is not enough to succeed; others must fail.” If Lauren is widely considered a beauty, what Julie would like to hear is not that she’s “good-looking,” but that she’s “better-looking than Lauren.” Beating others is a glorious victory; a compliment without reference points has less tangible value. If your prey can point out some official award that so-and-so got that he didn’t, pooh-pooh it: “Oh come on, that’s just politics and you know it.”*  

- Page 28 (location ~ 415-420)    

*SITUATION: You’ve just witnessed your prey win a wrestling match. STIFF: “Nice going.” BOOR: “Big deal. I know guys that could take you.” CHARMER: “It was sort of like a man against a boy. I guess that guy got a taste of what it’s like to grapple against a real pro.”*  

- Page 29 (location ~ 432-435)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says about a mutual acquaintance that he is so fat he needs a bookmark to keep track of where his real chin is. STIFF: Shocked silence. BOOR: Laughs loudly and adds, “You’re right! That pig never takes the feedbag off. I swear, just seeing him ruins my appetite.” CHARMER: Shakes head as if amused by the antics of a favorite but slightly naughty child, and says, “You are wicked!”*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 446-450)    

*If even the scantest evidence of a brain is proffered, exclaim, “Wow, not only good-looking, but smart too!” Add, “You must have beaten a lot of competition to get her. She could have had her pick.” ( Not, “You must have been the only guy who ever expressed an interest in her.”) If the subject of his wife’s first marriage comes up, say, “Looks like she got it wrong the first time, right the second.” ( Not, “Whatsamatter? Couldn’t get a new wife, had to get a used one?”)*  

- Page 30 (location ~ 456-460)    

*SITUATION: You’ve just met your prey’s new bride. STIFF: “It was nice to meet Susan.” BOOR: “Whenever you see a good-looking girl, you must regret mar- rying Susan.” CHARMER: “Looks like you’re the winner in the marriage sweep- stakes.”*  

- Page 31 (location ~ 461-463)    

*you’re informed that Billy Jr. got two base hits in his Little League game, nod sagely and say, “He could have major league poten- tial in the long run.” This is of course his parents’ fondest dream, and such dreams usually preclude a realistic look at the odds. If little Rebecca gets an A on a test, offer, “Who knows, a kid like that could end up as a Harvard professor, or even a Nobel laureate.” The ludicrousness of this statement will be lost on the parents. No matter what she looks like, you can exclaim, “She could be a child model!” (Parents are notoriously blind to their children’s ugliness.)*

If Johnny has a boyish cuteness (or even if he doesn’t), say, “I can tell he’s going to be a real lady killer. He’ll probably break a lot of hearts.” This will make any parent swell with pride. If you’re a parent, it’s all too easy to get lost in a fantasy about your child’s glorious future.*  

- Page 31 (location ~ 466-474)    

*SITUATION: Your prey announces that little Bobby Jr. has a lemon- ade stand. STIFF: “Oh.” BOOR: “Those things are so obnoxious. I never stop at them.” CHARMER: “He certainly has the entrepreneurial instinct. Sounds to me as if we have another Bill Gates on our hands.”*  

- Page 31 (location ~ 474-477)    

*SITUATION: Your prey is out for a walk with his dog. STIFF: Doesn’t comment on it one way or the other, and shies away when the dog comes up for a sniff. BOOR: “That thing reminds me of the mutt my sister used to have. We used to pelt it with snowballs. My sister would get so mad … What a bitch. Hey—that word describes both of them!” CHARMER: “That’s one lucky dog. You’d be surprised how many owners just leave their dogs tied up in the backyard all day long.”*  

- Page 33 (location ~ 495-500)    

*First, swear your prey to silence, and make him promise on pain of death to never, ever tell anyone. (This usually insures that he will tell only two or three people.) Then, when telling your “secret,” lower your voice, even if the two of you are standing on a deserted beach. (If you lower your voice, people will not only believe whatever it is you tell them, but will impute more value to it.) If you don’t have any secrets, just voice a long held suspicion. If you don’t want to risk being wrong, just phrase it this way: “Don’t tell anyone, but I’m pretty sure that …” (It’s always fun to speculate about who’s gay, who’s rich, who’s cheating, who’s an alcoholic, etc.) Eventually, your prey will see you as a source of interesting information, and will value you as such.*  

- Page 33 (location ~ 504-510)    

*SITUATION: Your prey, fishing for a compliment, says he could only bench press two hundred and forty pounds that day. STIFF: “That doesn’t seem so bad.” BOOR: “I know guys who can bench four hundred.” CHARMER: “You’re so weak—I’m surprised you can lift your fork and knife.”*  

- Page 35 (location ~ 531-534)    

*SITUATION: Your prey shot a hole-in-one at his golf course the previ- ous weekend. STIFF: “Nice going.” BOOR: “Why don’t you tell someone who cares.” CHARMER: (holding up an imaginary microphone) “Mike Smith, UPI. Sir, is there any truth to the rumor that steroids helped you accom- plish this feat?”*  

- Page 36 (location ~ 547-550)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just given painstakingly detailed direc- tions to a stranger from out of town. STIFF: Says nothing. BOOR: “It’s more fun to give the wrong directions.” 34 When He’s Been Gracious 35 CHARMER: (shaking head in wonderment) “I don’t think most peo- ple appreciate how gracious you really are.”*  

- Page 37 (location ~ 562-565)    

*The first thing you must do is look pleased to see him. This is the hardest thing to fake, but also the most important. A cold, impassive stare will send a chill down his spine and pretty much negate any sub-sequent friendliness. The next thing is to call out his name heartily. If you can’t remem- ber his name, try to avoid saying, “Sorry, I’m drawing a blank on your name,” which usually means that he barely registers on your radar screen. Instead, just say, “Heyyyyy!” with extra enthusiasm, and add, “I was just thinking of you!” Then shake his hand heartily, and give him the double handclasp, grasping the back of his right hand with your left; this conveys twice the enthusiasm. Then, before letting go with your right hand, clasp his right shoulder with your left hand. The impression your greeting should leave him with is, “Gee, I didn’t know he liked me that much.” SITUATION: You see your prey approaching you in a hallway. STIFF: Holds up one hand as if to stop him and says, “Hi …,” uncer- tain whether it’s appropriate to stop and chat, starting an awkward pas a deux. BOOR: Says “What’s up?” in the tired voice one uses when expect- ing to be hit up for the latest of a long series of favors. 36 Meeting and Greeting 37 CHARMER: Approaches him squarely so he must stop, pumps his hand excitedly, and says, “Hey! I was hoping I would run into you.”*  

- Page 38 (location ~ 568-582)    

*Or, after introducing your prey, tell him, “You’ve been heavily advertised to Bill here as the coolest guy in the world—so don’t disappoint him!” On the surface, your act is kiddingly confrontational, but the underlying message is that you’ve been building him up. Or say, “This is the guy I was saying is so funny.” Turn to your prey. “You have a big rep to live up to, I hope you’re feeling witty today.” Or say to the third party, “I know you’ve been wanting to meet him.” This will make your prey feel important, and it will probably dawn on him that the only reason the other guy would want to meet him is because you’ve been building him up. It is preferable to have said something about your prey to the third party; if your comment is met by a blank stare, your credibility may suffer.*  

- Page 39 (location ~ 587-595)    

*SITUATION: You’re introducing your prey (John Smith) to a third party. STIFF: “Rob, this is John.” BOOR: Doesn’t bother to introduce them. CHARMER: “Rob Callahan, meet John Smith—yes, THE John Smith.”*  

- Page 39 (location ~ 596-598)    

*The following lines—or at least variations on them—can be uttered on any occasion. They seem a little far-fetched, and therefore must be delivered without even a hint of sarcasm, but if your prey has a typical ego, he’ll eat them right up. If you’ve just been watching him in action, try one of these: “It’s been a real privilege to watch you play tennis.” “What a treat it is to hear you play the piano.” If you’ve actually been competing against him: “It’s been an honor just to be on the same court as you.” “I really don’t feel worthy to play tennis with someone as good as you.” “You always bring out my best—you’re an inspiration to me.” The following are all-purpose lines that can be trotted out on any occasion: “It’s always a special occasion just to be in the same room as you.” “I know it sounds silly, but I feel as if your presence somehow ele- vates me.” “I feel as if I’m in the presence of greatness. I really do.” “It’s not often I get to be around someone like you.” “I have so much respect for what you stand for.” If he asks you what that is, answer as if you’re surprised that he would even ask: “Integrity and intelligence, of course.” (Everyone believes they have these two qualities.) “I feel I’m a better person for having known you.” “I feel like I ought to genuflect in your presence.”*  

- Page 40 (location ~ 599-613)    

*If you ever retreat in an argument, just say, “I always defer to my superiors.” (Don’t say this if he is actually ranked ahead of you in an organization, since that gives the statement a different meaning.) You have to be a real BS artist to deliver these lines with a straight face, let alone the conviction they require, but if you’ve practiced enough of the other techniques in this book, you probably qualify.*  

- Page 41 (location ~ 615-618)    

*SITUATION: Your prey appears at a restaurant you own. STIFF: “Hi John.” BOOR: “Oh, you again.” CHARMER: “John, you honor us with your presence. This is now hallowed ground.”*  

- Page 41 (location ~ 618-620)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just told you about his mother, whom he had been embarrassed to have to push around in a wheelchair when he was young, but who was so proud of him, and how after she died, he was so ashamed of the fact that he had been embarrassed by her. 42 “That Moved Me” 43 STIFF: “Oh.” BOOR: “Yeah, I can see why you’d be embarrassed by a mother in a wheelchair.” CHARMER: “That’s an amazing story.” Shakes his head thoughtfully.*  

- Page 42 (location ~ 632-637)    

*While describing someone as “nice” is often seen as a weak substitute for more substantive praise, people in fact like to be reassured that they are decent human beings. So when the opportunity arises, tell your prey that he’s a good person. “You’re really a decent person, aren’t you? I can always tell, I’m a good judge of these things.” This will both flatter your prey and cause him to believe that you actually do have good judgment. “You really do have a strong moral compass, don’t you? I can tell by the way you always refrain from the kind of selfishness most guys indulge in.” “You’re one of the few people who’s really guided by his conscience. You have all the signs: you’re generous, you’re unfailingly polite, you always seem to do the right thing.” “I can tell you were brought up well because you’re never nosy.”*  

- Page 42 (location ~ 638-646)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just finished talking to a couple of very elderly people. STIFF: Makes no comment. BOOR: “What are you wasting your time with those dried up old rai- sins for?” 44 “You’re a Good Person” 45 CHARMER: “I can tell what a good person you are by the way you’re so solicitous of people from whom you have nothing to gain.”*  

- Page 43 (location ~ 650-654)    

*Once you’ve established what a good person someone is, you can actu- ally use that as leverage to get your way. Tell your prey, “You seem like such a nice person, and yet you won’t even give me those front row seats.” The implication is that the only thing that prevents him from attaining full “nice person” status is giving you those desired seats. It’s a way of gently cajoling your prey into giving you what you want, while complimenting him at the same time. It’s gentle because you’ve told him you think he’s nice, except for this one little thing. Many people will immediately think, “I am a nice person, and this guy realizes it.” Now, most people aren’t going to take you all that seriously, and, if pressed, would say that you were just tossing off a mean-ingless line, but at a certain level, they’ll still react positively and will want to remove that one blemish from their otherwise perfect reputation.*

*SITUATION: A waiter at a fancy restaurant seats you next to the kitchen. STIFF: “Would it be possible to get another table?” BOOR: “Hey, don’t be an asshole. We don’t want to sit here.” CHARMER: “You seem like such a nice person, yet you’re putting us way off in Siberia.”*  

- Page 44 (location ~ 669-672)    

*So try any of the following lead-ups to a criticism: “You know better than that …” “I’m surprised that somebody as smart as you would be capable of making a mistake like that …” “A brilliant guy like you thinks that? Now I’ve seen everything …” “Come on, use that big brain of yours …” (Be careful this doesn’t come across as sarcasm.) “You’re the first guy I’ve ever met with an IQ over one-fifty who thinks that …” “Well, I guess even supercomputers make errors …”*  

- Page 45 (location ~ 680-685)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says that the capital of Japan is Hong Kong. STIFF: “No, it’s Tokyo.” BOOR: “Jesus Christ are you an idiot! It’s Tokyo!” CHARMER: “Come on, someone as smart as you knows it’s Tokyo. You just had a slip; you must be tired.”*  

- Page 45 (location ~ 690-693)    

*If you don’t want to do something with your prey, rule number one is, lie. Your excuse must be something unavoidable—and something you’d obviously rather not be doing. It can’t be, “Joey has some extra Rolling Stones tickets and I’d rather go with him.” Rule number two is, you must also make it sound as if you’re merely postponing, not canceling, which has a much harsher feel to it. Always ask for a “rain check.” Rule number three: express regret—not for your prey, but for your- self. A good way to do this is, “I’m so disappointed. I had really been looking forward to this. You know, I think I would have enjoyed the picnic even more than you would have.” This is flattering, and also sounds sincere. Rule number four: “try” to reschedule. If there are times or dates when you know he’s busy, try to reschedule for those dates. When he tells you he’s unavailable, express frustration.*  

- Page 46 (location ~ 693-701)    

*Rule number five: let this frustration turn into anger at whoever or whatever caused your withdrawal (before any actual rescheduling can take place). Erupt in fury: “I’m so angry. I can’t believe I have to go!” Or, “That goddamn Joey. He’s always screwing things up!” (If your prey is trying to reschedule, your fury should cause him to lose his train of thought.) Rule number six: don’t express any guilt, because guilt is something you would feel only if you were purposely standing your prey up, and you don’t want to leave that impression.*

Rule number seven: ask him to do something you know he doesn’t want to do. “At least promise me you’ll come to my daughter’s piano recital tomorrow night.”*

*SITUATION: You want to cancel your dinner plans with your (same sex) prey because you’ve got a hot date. STIFF: “Listen, would it be okay if I cancelled our dinner? I finally got Sherri to go out with me.” BOOR: Simply doesn’t show up. CHARMER: “Can I take a rain check on dinner? I’m really sorry, but I’d forgotten I’d promised my mother I’d take her to her bingo game tonight. Hey—do you want to come?”*

*“You’re the Only Person I Know Who …” We all like to think ourselves unique. On the other hand, we tend to regard others as interchangeable, and we sense that they regard us the same way. Therefore, any evidence that others do see us as unique is always welcome. You can provide this welcome evidence to your prey by telling him, “You’re one of a kind. You’re the only person I know who …” What follows should be some kind of compliment, preferably point- ing out what a polymath he is: “… knows both world history and sports.” “… can change a tire and recite poetry.” “… can both iron a shirt and shoot a gun.”*  

- Page 47 (location ~ 715-722)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has a bad case of attention deficit disorder, and hops from one subject to the next. STIFF: Does his best to follow the conversation. BOOR: “Will you stick to the subject for Crissakes?” CHARMER: “You’re the only person I know who, in the space of five minutes, can segue from explaining stock market psychology to cracking a funny joke to talking knowledgeably about crime statistics. A true Renaissance man.”*  

- Page 48 (location ~ 727-732)    

*If your prey is rich, equate his money with power, success, and even sexual desirability (sadly enough, this is mostly true). Encourage his belief (common among the rich) that money is everything. Let’s say your prey is worth half a million dollars. Tell him, “You know, the median household net worth in this country is thirty thou- sand dollars. That means you’re over sixteen times as successful as the average household!” (Your prey would much prefer to think of himself this way than as the poorest guy at his investment bank.) “You could have all sorts of servants working for you if you wanted.*  

- Page 48 (location ~ 732-738)    

*SITUATION: Your prey boasts that he is now finally a millionaire. STIFF: “Congratulations.” BOOR: “That’s nothing these days.” CHARMER: “I’m a little worried about you—can you fit through the eye of a needle?”*  

- Page 49 (location ~ 747-750)    

*SITUATION: Your prey bewails the fact that he doesn’t have as much money as a mutual acquaintance. STIFF: “Oh well.” BOOR: “No two ways about it, being poor has gotta suck.” CHARMER: “I bet he’d give all his money to look like you. Or to be as young as you.” 56*  

- Page 50 (location ~ 761-764)    

*There are times when you really want to get away from someone, espe- cially if you’re at a party with other people you’d rather be talking to. The trick is to accomplish that without communicating how you feel. One way is, “It’s been really great talking to you.” If you say this with enough enthusiasm, the person you’re talking to may not even realize that you’re purposely drawing the conversation to an end. Follow this up with, “Be sure to say good-bye before you leave,” then take his hand and shake it with both of yours, as if you really want to see him again. Another tactic is to say, “Oh, there’s someone I want to introduce you to,” if you spot someone with any common interests. Call the other person over, introduce them, then at least you’ll have someone more interesting to talk to as well. If you manage the situation skillfully, you can actually take your leave and stick the new person with the boring one. Or say, “Oh no, there’s Zeke, and I promised I’d talk to him about his dissertation. I’ve been dreading this, but … oh well, wish me luck.”*  

- Page 51 (location ~ 776-785)    

*“You’re So Charming” One of the best ways to charm is to convince your prey that he’s charming. (Even if he is a boor—perhaps especially if he is a boor—he’ll believe you.) So point this out. “You always seem to say just the right thing.” “You always know what to say, don’t you?” “You have more good lines than anyone else I know.” “You can charm anyone …” Shake your head and grin, “… the birds right out of the trees.” Or, “… the pants right off of anyone.” (The sexual connotation here is acceptable given that it is a common expression.)*  

- Page 52 (location ~ 790-796)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has been the life of a party, and a friend of his points this out. What do you say? STIFF: (nothing) BOOR: “I don’t think so.” CHARMER: “What’s it like, having the entire world wrapped around your little finger?”*  

- Page 53 (location ~ 802-804)    

*SITUATION: Your prey suggests a second beer, one above your nor- mal limit. STIFF: “No thanks. I was planning to run five miles this evening.” BOOR: “Long as you’re paying.” CHARMER: “You are definitely a corrupting influence on me. Now you’ve got me drinking to excess. I really do seem to be under your sway.”*  

- Page 54 (location ~ 814-817)    

*SITUATION: Your prey happens to mention the circumstances of your meeting. STIFF: Nods. BOOR: “That was your lucky day.” CHARMER: “It actually scares me to think that if either of us had decided not to go to that party, none of this would ever have hap- pened!”*  

- Page 55 (location ~ 833-836)    

*Unanswerable questions fall into two basic categories: compliments and insults. The best way to respond to both is with a self-deprecating comment that will either tickle or mollify your prey. Complimentary questions are those such as, “How did you ever get to be so funny?” or “When did you get so cute?” or “Is there anyone else in the world nearly as smart as you?” One way to respond to these is to say, “You seem to think I’m some- thing more than I am. But misguidedly high opinions of me are always welcome.” Another way to deal with such questions is to say, “I have to disagree with the premise of your question.” Negative unanswerable questions, on the other hand, tend to call for more individualized responses: If someone cries out, “When are you going to grow up?” purse your lips as if seriously pondering your answer, then reply, “Probably never. You know, my middle name is Peter Pan.” If someone says, “Will you get lost?” answer in a child’s voice, “But there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.” If someone asks, “Will you get out of here?” answer, “I’m starting to get the sense—call it a hunch—that you don’t want me here.”*  

- Page 55 (location ~ 837-848)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks, in a fit of anger, “Why are you such a pain in the ass?” STIFF: Pulls back as if stung by a bee, but can think of nothing to say. BOOR: “You fucking asshole, I oughta beat the shit outa you!” CHARMER: (shrugging) “Because it’s so much fun!”*  

- Page 56 (location ~ 854-857)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says he doesn’t think he’s very tough. STIFF: “Oh well, toughness isn’t that important.” BOOR: “That’s always been my impression.” CHARMER: “Are you fishing for a compliment here? Because if you are, forget it. You know perfectly well how tough you are.”*  

- Page 57 (location ~ 867-869)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says he’ll never be a success in business. STIFF: “Well, success is a relative term.” BOOR: “Yeah—but you’ve got a great future as a cashier at McDonalds.” CHARMER: “When you become a billionaire and have all sorts of courtiers fawning all over you, I want you to remember that I was the one who told you you’d be rich—and I want you to remember me—in your will.”*  

- Page 58 (location ~ 885-889)    

*Flattery is what people want, but empathy is what they sometimes need. If you can provide this, you will become indispensable. Your prey will be impressed that you understand his travails, grateful that you consoled him, and touched that you made the effort. Keep in mind, empathy is not the same quality as sympathy. Empathy is the ability to imagine what others are thinking and feeling; sympathy is the expression of concern for another’s plight. In order to effectively sympathize, one must be able to empathize. Then, of course, you must be able to express that sympathy without sounding condescending. Even better than that is to console your prey without him fully realizing what you’ve done.*  

- Page 59 (location ~ 890-895)    

*Even if you’re totally blasé about speaking in public, confide in him that you’re extremely nervous. Tell him, “I have a really bad case of butterflies in my stomach. I’m so nervous, I’m afraid I may throw up in the middle of my speech.” Look at your palms, then wipe them on your pants. In case he doesn’t get the point, say, “My palms are sweating.” By now your prey should be feeling a little better. If he’s not, use a little humor. Examine your crotch closely. When he asks you what you’re doing, reply, “I’m waiting for the little dark spot to appear.” Add, “Listen, if I crap in my pants don’t tell anyone, okay?” Shake your head and say, “I could sure use a drink right now. Actu- ally, I could use about three. Or maybe a tranquilizer—maybe one of those hypodermic darts they shoot into the rhinos to calm them down before they check their teeth on the nature shows.” Shakily say, “I’d rather have root canal work done than have to do this.”*  

- Page 59 (location ~ 900-909)    

*SITUATION: You and your prey are both about to compete in your college conference championships, and he says he’s extremely ner- vous. STIFF: “You’ll do fine, I think.” BOOR: “You’re such a woman. Grow a pair of balls, willya?” CHARMER: Replies, “You?!” Takes a deep breath and puts a finger on the inside of his wrist, then looks at his watch. Announces, “My heart rate is a hundred and forty. God I hate this feeling. I hate it, I hate it, I hate*  

- Page 60 (location ~ 916-920)    

*Put it into perspective: “It’s just a job. They say the average person has sixteen jobs in his lifetime, and switches careers three times.” “I read once that over 70 percent of people who lose their jobs are making more money within a year and a half than they were before they lost their job.” “I didn’t want to tell you this before, but that guy you worked for seemed like a real jerk.” (Your prey will hardly be in a frame of mind to disagree with this.) Thoughts of revenge are always sweet. “Maybe we could put a pipe bomb under his car.” If you’re absolutely sure he won’t take it, offer to lend him some money to tide him over.*  

- Page 61 (location ~ 926-933)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just lost his job. STIFF: “That’s too bad.” BOOR: “Maggie’s not going to go out with you anymore if you don’t have any money.” CHARMER: “Ten years from now you’ll probably walk back in there and buy the place.”*  

- Page 61 (location ~ 934-937)    

*SITUATION: Your prey took a fall while playing soccer and sustained a bruise, which he shows you. STIFF: “Oh.” BOOR: (laughs as if it’s funny) “Relax, you’ll survive. Jesus, you’re such a baby.” CHARMER: “If that happened to me, I wouldn’t have been able to keep playing.”*  

- Page 63 (location ~ 951-954)    

*Let’s say he just got turned down by a girl and is feeling blue about it. Any of the following lines, delivered with a touch of sarcasm, will do the trick: “How long are you going to be in mourning about this?” “That’s really too bad, because, you know, she is the last girl left on earth.” “I’d been feeling bad about [a recent disaster that caused great loss of life], but now I guess I have something to really feel bad about.” “I’m certainly glad you’re not the type to make a mountain out of a molehill.”*  

- Page 63 (location ~ 958-963)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just gotten a D on a test, bringing his overall grade for the course down to a B-. He seems to be overreact- ing. STIFF: “That’s too bad.” BOOR: “Ha! Serves you right for being such a weenie.” CHARMER: “I haven’t had a really good cry in a while. This will give me the opportunity. About time my tear ducts got cleaned out.”*  

- Page 64 (location ~ 969-973)    

*If your prey embarrasses himself publicly, whisper to him that this particular group doesn’t approve of that particular behavior, that they’re a little weird that way. Chuckle, “Billy, for some strange reason, around here people think it’s wrong to pat a woman’s ass if you don’t know her, so you might want to hold off on that while you’re in town.” Or act as if he’s a rare treasure who keeps you constantly amused and awed at his originality: “Billy, I’ve got to hand it to you, there aren’t many guys who’d take a leak on the street in full view of everybody.” Or give your prey absolution on the grounds that he’s a bold, straight-talker who tells it like it is: “The problem with the world today is that there’s not enough honesty. Now that that lady knows she has a fat rear end, she may go on a diet, and she’ll be better off, thanks to you.”*  

- Page 64 (location ~ 977-984)    

*SITUATION: Your prey unintentionally but audibly passes gas at a party. STIFF: Looks disgusted and steps away. BOOR: (loudly, drawing the attention of even those who had not noticed it) “Oh, you pig! Peee-uuu!” CHARMER: ( sotto voce, to prey) “We all get gas. It’s not as if anyone here never let one rip before.”*  

- Page 65 (location ~ 990-993)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just spent the evening in a vain attempt to get a few laughs from his dinner table companions. STIFF: “Oh well.” BOOR: “That went over like a lead balloon. You better keep your day job.” CHARMER: (whispers to prey) “Having you here is like sticking Cary Grant in a Three Stooges movie.”*  

- Page 66 (location ~ 1006-1010)    

*SITUATION: Someone calls your prey weird for collecting stamps, then walks away. STIFF: Looks at prey, and makes no comment. BOOR: Laughs harshly, “He’s right.” CHARMER: “Half the kids on my block had a stamp album when I was growing up. Anyway, have you ever noticed it’s always the peo- ple who accuse others of being weird who are in fact the weirdest?”*  

- Page 67 (location ~ 1027-1030)    

*Don’t Let Him Feel Alone 85 SITUATION: You and your prey are listening to your coach give a pre-game pep talk, which he ends with a rousing cry to “kill” the opposing team. STIFF: Raises his fist and weakly says, “Yeah.” BOOR: Stands up, pumps both fists, and yells, “Kill! KILL RIDGE- FIELD!!” at the top of his lungs. CHARMER: Raises one fist and whispers to prey, “What a bunch of morons.”*  

- Page 69 (location ~ 1046-1050)    

*SITUATION: You and your prey arrive at your car. STIFF: Uses his remote to unlock both doors, gets in on his side. BOOR: Uses the key to unlock his own door, gets in, starts the car, puts it in reverse, then, only as an afterthought, steps on the brake and reaches over to unlock his prey’s door. CHARMER: Walks to the passenger side door, opens it, and holds it open for his prey. When his prey is comfortably seated, he closes the door firmly but gently, and only then goes around and gets in himself.*  

- Page 70 (location ~ 1065-1069)    

*SITUATION: You and your prey are on your way to a party, hoping to meet some girls. STIFF: “I hope there aren’t too many guys there.” BOOR: “Girls there better not be a buncha skanks, like that last party you took me to.” CHARMER: “The night is young, anything could happen. And you know what? There’s no one I’d rather share this adventure with. Because whenever I’m with you, for some reason the world just seems like a more appealing place.”*  

- Page 71 (location ~ 1080-1085)    

*SITUATION: The subject of friendship arises during a discussion between you and your prey. STIFF: “I consider you a friend, I guess.” BOOR: “I figure it’s every man for himself.” CHARMER: “I feel closer to you than I feel to anyone else outside my family, and that includes my girlfriend.”*  

- Page 72 (location ~ 1099-1102)    

*Think of the people you’ve known who’ve had the presence of mind to be able to wink at you during a stressful situation. Were any of them not charming? Winks are great for defusing tension. Let’s say you’ve gotten into a violent argument in front of your prey. When the person you’re argu- ing with looks away for a moment, turn to your prey and give him a quick wink. This shows that you’re not really taking the argument too seriously, and that even though you sound angry, to a certain extent you’re just playacting. It also shows that your prey is the one whose opinion you care about, since you’ve taken the trouble to wink at him.*  

- Page 73 (location ~ 1105-1111)    

*SITUATION: The car in front of you stops suddenly, and despite the fact that you slam on your brakes, you still hit it. The other driver gets out, and after a quick glance at his rear fender, comes up and yells, “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” STIFF: At first, says, “Oh shit.” Then, when the other driver walks up angrily, responds, “Sorry.” BOOR: At first, yells, “Goddamn it!” Then yells at the other driver, “It was your fault, you fucking asshole! Why did you stop like that?!” CHARMER: After asking his prey if he’s okay, he then winks at him and says, “I don’t think I’m about to become fast friends with this guy.”*  

- Page 73 (location ~ 1119-1125)    

*If you’re at a party, take your leave of a good-looking woman by say- ing, “My mother always taught me that a man should spend as much time talking to the unattractive women as he does to the beauties, so I’m afraid I’m going to have to work my way around the room a bit more.” Add, “I do plan to come back for some more dessert later on though.”*  

- Page 74 (location ~ 1133-1136)    

*SITUATION: You’re telling an anecdote about your vacation in Esto- nia. STIFF: “Anyway, this incredibly beautiful girl started gesturing to me in sign language that she wanted me to come home with her, and my buddies were all egging me on to do it … but I didn’t know what to do. I mean I wanted to, but I just felt so awkward. I guess I should have gone.” BOOR: “… so I went back to her room and fucked her. It was great, ’cause afterward I didn’t have to talk to her at all.” CHARMER: “… but I didn’t really see the point. I mean, we didn’t even speak the same language—who knew if we really had anything in common?”*  

- Page 75 (location ~ 1149-1155)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks you point-blank if you slept with a certain woman. (You did.) STIFF: “Uh … ask her.” (This is tacit admission.) BOOR: “Oh yeah! She was really horny, too! I’m telling you, that bitch loved taking it up the ass.” CHARMER: (shaking head ruefully) “No, but what I wouldn’t have given …”*  

- Page 76 (location ~ 1162-1165)    

*SITUATION: Your prey’s worst enemy just won the lottery. STIFF: “Wow … what luck.” BOOR: “Ha! You must be eating your heart out!” CHARMER: “You know, practically every lottery winner I ever heard of had his life go to pieces afterward. Everyone comes to them with their hands out, they become alcoholics, they get in trouble with the law, they don’t factor in the taxes they owe, they eventually go broke. It’s pretty much guaranteed.”*  

- Page 77 (location ~ 1180-1184)    

*Imitating your prey’s posture generally means that you agree with him, and maybe even want to emulate him. Putting an arm around someone’s shoulders is a nominally friendly gesture, but be aware that it also expresses dominance. Interestingly, staying perfectly still can have a disconcerting effect on the other person, although they are generally unaware of it.*  

- Page 80 (location ~ 1221-1224)    

*SITUATION: Your prey tells you a story. STIFF: Nods frequently to indicate he is listening, stands awkwardly, moves spasmodically from time to time, and keeps a fixed smile on his face that gradually turns into a grimace. BOOR: Never once looks at him, yawns loudly, looks at his watch, shakes his head disgustedly, and makes a circular motion with his hand as if to say, “Hurry up!” CHARMER: Faces his prey squarely and looks him in the eye. He leans forward as if he wants to hear every last word his prey says, the hint of amusement in his face slowly turning into outright delight.*  

- Page 80 (location ~ 1225-1230)    

*Self-deprecation is the essence of charm. If you can hold your own worst faults up to the light and laugh at them, it means you’re not likely to get angry at any comment your prey makes. A reliable rule of thumb is that the more people lie to themselves, the more often they get “offended” whenever people say something that reflects negatively on their self-image. In psychology, such people are known as narcissistic personalities. You want to show, through skillful self-deprecation, that you are a completely un-narcissistic personality. While reading the following chapters, please keep in mind that you cannot say things that are obviously untrue, otherwise you will appear falsely modest—the kiss of death for any would-be charmer. A handsome guy who complains about his ugliness merely comes across phony, or as if he’s fishing for compliments. You must instead have the courage to pick apart your weak points. If you are a harsh enough self-critic, you will even take away others’ desire to criticize you.*  

- Page 81 (location ~ 1232-1239)    

*SITUATION: The subject of your appearance comes up. STIFF: “I’m okay, I guess.” BOOR: “I’m a damn good-looking guy. Everybody says I look like George Clooney.” CHARMER: “I’m thinking about going to a plastic surgeon, have him change every single feature on my face. No one would recognize me, but at least that way I’d get a fresh start.”*  

- Page 83 (location ~ 1259-1263)    

*If your prey compliments you on your academic accomplishments, say, “Thanks. I’m actually fairly dumb, I just study hard.” Intelligence is intimidating, bookwormishness is not. Or respond, “Know what the definition of an intellectual is? Some- one who thinks he’s smart.” If your prey compliments you on your eloquence, reply, “Better glib than smart. I never really know what I’m talking about, but I do sound good, don’t I?”*  

- Page 83 (location ~ 1271-1275)    

*Say, “Sometimes, when I walk, I have to remind myself, left foot, right foot, left foot … Stuff that you take for granted doesn’t come so easy to me.”*  

- Page 84 (location ~ 1286-1287)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks how you did on your SATs. (You got a thousand, combined.) STIFF: “I don’t remember” (even though he actually does). BOOR: “Fourteen hundred and ten” (rounding up by four hundred). CHARMER: (brightly) “I got an eight hundred. That was math and verbal combined.”*  

- Page 84 (location ~ 1287-1290)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks how much you weigh. (You weigh two thirty, much of it fat.) STIFF: (sighs) “Two twenty-six. I’ve got to get back on my diet.” BOOR: “Fuck you!” CHARMER: “Two thirty. I’m proud to report, I’ve won my battle against anorexia.”*  

- Page 85 (location ~ 1302-1305)    

*SITUATION: You’re a guy who’s six feet tall and weighs 137 pounds. Someone compliments you for being thin. STIFF: “Oh … thanks, I guess.” BOOR: “I couldn’t stand to be a fatso like you.” 109 If You’re Skinny 110 CHARMER: “I’ll probably be one of those guys who in middle age just transitions directly from being skinny to being paunchy, without ever being a happy medium.”*  

- Page 86 (location ~ 1317-1322)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks how tall you are. (You’re five foot six.) STIFF: “Five feet six inches.” BOOR: “Five eight, what’s it to you?” CHARMER: “Five six. I think it’s why I have even more of a Napole- onic complex that Bonaparte himself actually had.”*  

- Page 87 (location ~ 1330-1333)    

*One line sure to quell jealousy is, “I have a boss who is the most bel-ligerent, self-righteous hypocrite you’ve ever met. And he seems to enjoy humiliating me in front of other people.” “When you work with a guy who takes all the credit and none of the blame, you get left with none of the credit and all of the blame. Unfortunately, I need my job.” Even if you’re the star rainmaker at an investment bank, tell your prey, “My job is basically to kiss ass. If my boss makes some incredibly lame joke, I have to laugh like it’s the funniest thing I ever heard.”*  

- Page 88 (location ~ 1343-1348)    

*“My official job title is Vice President, but my unofficial job description is ‘toady.’ If the boss wants coffee, I get it. I’m basically a gofer.” “I’m sorta the combination butt-boy and scapegoat of my office. These bankers are the most sociopathic people you’ll ever meet. If they weren’t doing that, they’d be serial killers. As it is, they’re all serial character assassins.” No matter what your job, you can make it sound horrible. SITUATION: You’re an investment banker with a promising career at one of the top Wall Street firms. Your prey says enviously that you must be making a ton of money. STIFF: “I don’t know … I guess.” BOOR: (gleefully) “I could probably buy and sell you ten times over.” CHARMER: “On an hourly basis, I think junior bankers like me barely make minimum wage—the hours are horrendous. See these wrin- kles? This job is taking years off my life.”*  

- Page 88 (location ~ 1349-1358)    

*“I’m a doctor—my specialties are urology and Medicaid rip-off.” “I’m a cop—it’s a great job if you enjoy planting evidence and roughing up innocent bystanders.” “I’m a reporter—when I’m not shoving cameras in grieving rela- tives’ faces, I’m raking muck.” “I’m an automotive engineer—one of those guys helping get rid of the ozone layer.” “I’m an insurance executive—you know, a glorified pencil pusher.” (The “pencil pusher” description can be applied to virtually any white-collar job.) “I work construction—I’m one of those obnoxious guys in the hard hats who whistles at the girls as they walk by.” You can actually use such statements as a springboard to do a little boasting about what you do. (“Seriously, what I actually do is …”) As long as you’re aware of what the popular image of your field is, virtually any job can be excused. (“I’m an interrogation officer. You know how they have the good cop/bad cop routine? Well I’m the bad cop. It’s my job to make Abu Ghraib look like a country club.”)*

*SITUATION: A girl at a party asks what you do for a living. STIFF: “I’m a stockbroker.” BOOR: “I’m a personal financial consultant at Merrill. Number one producer in my office for the last three years, actually. It’s how I afford the condo in Florida.” CHARMER: “I’m a stockbroker—you know, one of those people who gets rich selling Enron and WorldCom to widows.”*  

- Page 90 (location ~ 1375-1378)    

*If your prey was a nonathlete, start by commenting on the silliness of athletics: “I was on the football team. People take that sport so seriously, the coaches especially. You’d think they were generals in World War II. And they try to imbue the sport with moral qualities that have nothing to do with it.” Nonathletes often regard athletics the way most people regard hopscotch, as a time-wasting diversion, so your prey will agree. Continue, “Football is the dumbest sport in the world. We’re human beings, not rams. I was lucky not to be permanently injured, unlike a lot of my teammates who are still gimping around. Of course, that’s ’cause I was third string and never got to play.”*  

- Page 91 (location ~ 1382-1387)    

*No matter what your sport, there is a way to put yourself down: “I did cross country, as you can tell from my build.” “I was a gymnast. It was either that or be a jockey.” “I was a baseball player. That’s why I have such a great cardiovascu- lar system.” “I wasn’t tall enough for basketball, strong enough for football, or tough enough for cross country, so I went out for the chess team.”*  

- Page 91 (location ~ 1388-1392)    

*“My wrestling coach called me ‘the turtle’ because once I was on my back I was helpless.” If you played a team sport, and are asked what position you played, reply, “Mostly I played bench warmer. My goal was to make second string, which I never quite did.” Add, “I was one of those guys who made the other guys look good. Can’t have stars if there aren’t scrubs, right?” “I scored three goals one game, but two of them were in our own goal. The coaches used to get so mad at me, just ’cause I had a little problem with dyslexia.”*  

- Page 91 (location ~ 1394-1400)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks if you played a sport in school. STIFF: “I swam.” BOOR: “I was state champ in the hundred fly.” CHARMER: “I swam. My coach would always give the other guys time goals. With me, he’d be happy if I didn’t drown.” Shrugs, “They always alerted the lifeguards when my event came up.”*  

- Page 92 (location ~ 1406-1409)    

*If you have a big house, the idea is to make your prey feel the least jealousy possible when he sees it. After he oohs and aahs about your mansion, say, “This thing is a white elephant. I’ve done nothing but pour money into it, and it’s always hungry for more.” Even if you paid for your house out of your spare change, confide, “I’m going to be working forever just to pay it off.” When you get to the master bedroom, say, “These are the servants’ quarters.” Shrug, “I’m the servant around here, so …” If any of the rooms are not well lit, explain, “I’m partial to the mau-soleum look … I also like subways as a motif.” If your lawn is not well tended, say, “You know how they name big estates? I call this place ‘Weed Gardens.’ It was either that or ‘Termite City.’”*  

- Page 93 (location ~ 1413-1420)    

*If there are any broken windows, say, “I wanted a well ventilated house. Fresh air is important to me.” “When I bought this property, the house was considered a tear- down. Still is, actually.” “This is what you call an unpretentious house. If it were any more unpretentious, I guess it would have to be a corrugated tin roof shanty.”*  

- Page 93 (location ~ 1425-1428)    

*Point at the four sides of the room and say, “That’s the East Wing, this is the West Wing, that’s the North Wing, and that’s the South Wing.” Then walk a couple steps over to the other side of he room. When your prey next speaks, cup your hand around your ear and say, “Sorry, can’t hear you, I’m all the way over in the North Wing.”*  

- Page 94 (location ~ 1431-1434)    

*SITUATION: Your prey compliments you on your spacious house. STIFF: “I guess it is pretty big.” BOOR: “I couldn’t live like a peon anymore.” (Despite the fact that his prey lives in a small house.) CHARMER: “This house is as much work as having a child, but with- out the emotional reward. If I had to do it over again, I’d buy a smaller house.”*  

- Page 94 (location ~ 1434-1438)    

*If it’s a fancy car, you have to make fun of yourself for having bought it. Say, “The World Trade Center bombing [substitute any recent disaster] really made me re-examine my values, think long and hard about what really mattered to me: family, friends, and so on. Anyway, after some extensive soul-searching … I went out and bought a Lexus.” Tap the roof of the car and say, “I had to dip into my children’s educational fund in order to finance it, but you gotta admit, it looks good on me.” “After driving this thing around for a month, I had an epiphany: I am the human equivalent of a Lexus LS430. I guess that’s why people buy cars like this, because they see themselves that way.”*  

- Page 94 (location ~ 1440-1446)    

*SITUATION: Your prey compliments you on your Lexus LS430. BOOR: “This is some set of wheels, eh?” STIFF: “Oh, thanks.” CHARMER: “I wanted the kind of car that proclaimed Mid-Life Crisis very loudly.” Add, “Actually, this is how I make up for being short and fat.”*  

- Page 95 (location ~ 1457-1460)    

*Or, “To be honest, I’m a cross-dresser. I don’t know that much about men’s clothes, but you should see me when I’m dressed up as a woman—I’m the height of fashion.” On the rare occasion that you dress up, if somebody comments on it, say, “I look like a mobster all dressed up to go to church.” Or, “I figure if I have nice clothes, people will overlook my person- ality.” Or, “I honestly feel like a little kid dressed up in his father’s clothes.”*  

- Page 97 (location ~ 1474-1479)    

*SITUATION: Your prey criticizes your somewhat dingy clothes. STIFF: “These aren’t so bad.” BOOR: “You’re not exactly what I’d call a fashion plate either.” CHARMER: “You’re right, I guess it’s time for another trip to Good- will. Not to get rid of these, but to pick up a new outfit.”*  

- Page 97 (location ~ 1479-1482)    

*If you are a man trying to score points with a woman, you can make great strides by sympathizing with the women’s viewpoint. Start by saying, “You know, I hate to say it, but the world really would be a better place if it were run by women.” Continue, “Men have these huge egos that make them do battle over the silliest things. They all have this tremendous need to prove their masculinity, and it really makes them sort of pathetic.” “So many guys are just gross. There’s no other way to put it. And most of them will have sex with anything that moves. They’re like barnyard animals.” Lest your prey think you’re gay, say, “I swear, I’m a fag at heart.” (A gay man wouldn’t put it that way.) Add confidentially, “I even like going shopping for clothes. I’m a woman in the body of a man.”*  

- Page 97 (location ~ 1485-1492)    

*SITUATION: You’re a man talking to a woman, and the subject of sex differences arises. STIFF: “Yeah, I guess there are differences.” BOOR: “Women are such a pain. Once a month, like clockwork, it never fails. Of course, some women act like they’re on the rag thirty days a month.” CHARMER: “To tell the truth, I get along better with my female friends than with my male friends. I just enjoy their company more, feel we have more in common.”*  

- Page 98 (location ~ 1498-1502)    

*Get right to the point: “I feel sorry for guys. Most girls are such idiots. And the stuff they care about—shopping and clothes—yecch! I’d really rather just hang out and watch football.” Continue: “I hate the way those strident feminists—and what won- derful senses of humor they have—talk about equal pay for equal work, then they want the qualifications changed for the firemen’s test so that women don’t have to meet the same standards. And most of them still expect the guy to pay when they go out on a date.” Add, “So many women just want to see how much money they can get a guy to spend on them. It’s disgusting.”*  

- Page 99 (location ~ 1506-1512)    

*SITUATION: You’re a woman talking to a man, and the subject of sex differences arises. STIFF: “I don’t think that there are that many innate differences, it’s just that we’re raised differently.” BOOR: “Men always think they’re so great. I hate them.” CHARMER: “I don’t know how you put up with our mood swings. I really don’t.”*  

- Page 99 (location ~ 1517-1520)    

*If you really want to show perspective, place yourself in class and time: “I’m a typical middle-class kid born in America in the 1970s. I know my culture, but very little outside it. I’m familiar with MTV and the Internet. But I can’t fix a car, do plumbing, or carpentry. Put me in the jungle and I’d be dead in minutes.” SITUATION: You’re on a first date with your prey, who tells you you’re quite special. STIFF: (shrugging) “Oh, I don’t know.” BOOR: Nods and looks pleased that she recognizes his status. CHARMER: “I’m a nobody. Always have been, always will be.” (With this as a lead in, a small boast is now palatable.) “But I can be lots of fun.”*  

- Page 101 (location ~ 1538-1544)    

*you’re with a woman, and she asks why you have a reputation as a rake, profess mystification. (Wolves dress in sheep’s clothing for a reason.) Even if your mystification is met with disbelief, at least this will make you seem modest. At some point, say, “I’m just not very good with girls. I guess I just don’t have the seduction gene.” Add, “Most of the time, I don’t even have the nerve to make a move on them.” (Everyone except an out and out sociopath loses his nerve occasionally; this will just make you seem normal.)*  

- Page 102 (location ~ 1551-1555)    

*SITUATION: Your prey asks you how many women you’ve slept with. STIFF: “I don’t like to talk about that.” BOOR: “Forty” (even though it’s really four). CHARMER: “Four” (even though it’s really forty).*  

- Page 102 (location ~ 1562-1565)    

*SITUATION: Your hometown is Ottawa and you’ve just finished tell- ing your Minnesotan friend a rather dull story. STIFF: “Anyway, that’s the end, I guess.” BOOR: Says, “Agh,” and waves a dismissive hand at the Minneso- tan, as if he’s too dumb to understand the point of the story. CHARMER: “You know, by Canadian standards, that was a really exciting story.”*  

- Page 104 (location ~ 1584-1588)    

*like water. Obviously, being a wimp is the wise, if ignominious,*  

- Page 104 (location ~ 1591-1591)    

*“I met a guy the other day who was a Navy Seal. Boy was that emas- culating. You have any idea what those guys have to do to become Seals? As just one part of their training, they do a parachute jump from such high altitude that they have to wear oxygen masks, and they have to do it in the middle of the night, and they do it into the ocean. You couldn’t pay me enough to jump out of an airplane. I’m scared of the ocean—I don’t even like to swim in a lake when I can’t see the bottom. And to be honest, I’m sort of scared of the dark. I guess I’m not Seal material.”*  

- Page 104 (location ~ 1593-1598)    

*Talk about the time you got beaten up by a girl. “At first I thought it was a joke, but then she started really whacking me, so I figured I had to respond in kind. So I was getting ready to really haul off, when the 134 Make Fun of Your Own Wimpiness 135 next thing I knew she had me in an armlock and I was on the ground. I guess she knew ju jitsu or something.” Shake your head, “That’s cheating as far as I’m concerned. The bitch.” (Women will love this story.)*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1601-1606)    

*If you have a friend who’s much larger and stronger than you, threaten to beat him up in front of other people. (The emphasis in the previous sentence is on the word “friend”—you must choose someone good-natured who will play along with your little skit.) Bump chests with him. If you have to look straight up to stare him down, all the better. Snarl, “You even dream of disrespecting me and I’ll rip your head off and piss down your neck! I swear to God I’ll put my foot so far up your ass you’ll be tasting shoe leather for the next two weeks.” Then give him a shove for good measure. The sight of a toy poodle threatening a Rottweiler usually strikes people as funny. SITUATION: Your prey sees a hairy, fat-bodied spider on her wall, and, terrified, asks you to get it for her. STIFF: Reluctantly gathers a wad of tissue paper, and hesitantly dabs at it, but it darts off and disappears behind the sofa. BOOR: Takes off his shoe and splats the spider against the wall, wipes his shoe on the sofa, then gestures at the wall and says, “You clean it up.” CHARMER: Says, “I’m scared of spiders, too. I usually get my daughter to squash them for me.” Then swats the spider with his shoe and cleans off both his shoe and the wall with a piece of wet tissue paper.*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1609-1621)    

*If you’ve been lauded for some feat of strength, reply, “What I do for fun is run around and uproot oak trees.” Flex and ask, “Wanna feel my muscle?” Musclemen often wear clothes that accentuate their musculature. If you’re guilty of this, shrug, “I don’t have much money—I can’t afford shirts with sleeves.” Strike an exaggerated bodybuilder pose. “I have this need to see myself as the hero in a Schwarzenegger movie. The ironic thing is, I’m actually more the bully type.” (No real bully ever refers to himself as such.) “If anyone fights back, I just fold.”*  

- Page 106 (location ~ 1625-1630)    

*If You Have a Reputation for Being Macho 137 SITUATION: Your prey asks you about a fight you won. STIFF: “Well … I did win.” BOOR: “I rearranged that asshole’s face permanent.” CHARMER: “The argument did get pretty heated. I got my revenge though—I left without saying good-bye.”*  

- Page 107 (location ~ 1636-1639)    

*It is also true that a little dose of self-deprecation goes a long way towards making you appear grounded: “Thank you, but you go way too far.” “You’re alone in that opinion, but that makes it all the more appre- ciated.” “That was exactly what my tattered psyche needed.” If you agree with the compliment but want to come across as if you don’t, say, “You mock me.” “If I keep listening to you, I’m going to become really intolerable, so you better stop right now. I can feel my head getting bigger already.” “Thank you very much, but I’m an absolute novice compared to people who really know what they’re doing.”*  

- Page 107 (location ~ 1641-1647)    

*You can always deflect a compliment back: “Wow, coming from the master himself, that’s a real compliment.” If you’re complimented on one of your possessions, reply, “That’s how I affirm myself, through my possessions. I’m a very materialistic person.”*  

- Page 108 (location ~ 1648-1650)    

*You may have had your picture taken with a famous person. Say, “That was the day Jimmy Carter got to have his picture taken with me. I’m sure he’s got his copy of this photo in a prominent place in his house.”*  

- Page 109 (location ~ 1658-1660)    

*SITUATION: Your prey sees a picture of your family and says how good-looking they are. STIFF: “Thank you.” BOOR: “Good looks run in the genes I guess.” CHARMER: “It’s so rare that all of us are out of jail at the same time, we thought we’d have our picture taken. Usually we’re just a collec-tion of mug shots.”*  

- Page 109 (location ~ 1670-1673)    

*One of the most effective ways to put yourself down is to make a com- ment about yourself that starts off sounding as if it’s going to turn into a boast, but turns out to be entirely self-demeaning: “Hey—watch your step. I may be skinny, but I’m weak.” “I may be a little slow on the uptake, but I’m dumb.” “I’m aggressive, but obnoxious.” “I’m short, but Napoleonic.” “I’m shy, but easily cowed.” “I may be a little selfish, but on the other hand, I’m very greedy.” “I’m long-winded, but boring.” “I’m thrifty, but cheap.” “I may not be the best masseur in the world, but I’m also a lousy lover.” “A lot of the time I’m pretty dull, but sometimes I’m really dull.” If modesty is good, these lines are doubly good. This type of joke will render you funny but charming.*  

- Page 110 (location ~ 1674-1682)    

*If you are someone’s second choice for boyfriend, team captain, com- panion, whatever, and you know it, there’s nothing to do but cheer- fully accept that role and make light of it. First, acknowledge the fact: “I know Jim was your first choice, but that’s okay. I don’t mind being second choice, really. I’m used to it—it’s pretty much the story of my life.” “It’s actually sort of flattering to be somebody’s second—usually, I’m third or fourth.” “Being second choice keeps me from getting a swelled head. Believe me, if I thought I was the favorite, I’d be insufferable.”*  

- Page 113 (location ~ 1723-1729)    

*If you’re second choice in a romantic context, say, “It’s like that old song said—if you’re not with the one you love, love the one you’re with. Well, here I am.” “Maybe you can just close your eyes and pretend I’m Jim.” Make light of your second choice status gracefully enough, and soon you’ll be first choice.*  

- Page 114 (location ~ 1734-1737)    

*SITUATION: Your prey—whom you met three days before—obvi- ously doesn’t remember you when you say hi. He apologizes. What do you say? STIFF: “Oh, we met three days ago. Billy introduced us, remember?” BOOR: “Yeah, well, the only reason I remember you is because of that big fucking zit on your nose.” CHARMER: “Don’t worry about it. It’s actually an advantage not to be very memorable, you know. If I ever decide to commit a crime, no 148 If He Doesn’t Remember You 149 one will ever be able to describe me because I have no distinguish- ing marks and no distinguishing features.”*  

- Page 115 (location ~ 1752-1759)    

*Let’s say you’ve played a friendly—but trash-talking—game of ten- nis with your friend. After he beats you, you go to the net to shake his hand and tell him, “Congratulations, you deserved the victory. I don’t seem to have an answer for your serve, and I can’t scramble as well as you.” As soon as the words are out of your mouth, do a double take and exclaim, “Wow—for about five seconds there, I was actually a good sport. Anyway, after an hour of trash-talking, five seconds of sportsmanship is all you get—so I hope you enjoyed it while it lasted.” After you hold a door open for somebody, shake your head and say, “What was that? I don’t usually hold the door open for people. Hmm. I have to get back to being my rude self.”*  

- Page 117 (location ~ 1794-1800)    

*When There’s a Lull in the Conversation The best thing to do with awkward silences, especially when you are on a date, is avoid them. (This is easily done by having stock questions like “What would you do if you won the lottery?” on hand.) But if a lull does occur, rather than let it become uncomfortable, it’s best to jokingly draw attention to it. Ask, “Was that what they call an awkward silence?” Or say, “In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m the strong, silent type … well, the silent type, anyway.” Or, “I can’t believe you and I would run out of things to say,” as if you and she are the last people in the world who would not have things to talk about. You can always just blame yourself: “As you can see, I’m quite the conversationalist.” (This gives her the opportunity to blame herself, allowing both of you to be gracious at the same time.)*  

- Page 118 (location ~ 1809-1817)    

*“On the Internet …” One way to humorously highlight your personal shortcomings is to compare yourself to the way you advertise yourself on the Internet. For instance, if someone asks you how tall you are, reply, “Five foot eight.” Then add brightly, “But on the Internet, I’m five eleven.” Or, “I weigh 220. But on the Internet, I’m ‘a trim 185.’” “I’m forty-five. But on the Internet, I’m only thirty-five.” “I flip burgers for a living. But on the Internet, I’m a doctor.”*  

- Page 120 (location ~ 1828-1833)    

*SITUATION: The subject of Internet dating sites arises. STIFF: “I used one once.” BOOR: “I’ve never had any problem getting laid, and I’ve never had to use one of those sites.” (In fact, he uses them all the time.) CHARMER: “I actually put my brother’s picture on my site. He’s a lot better-looking than me. But if you’d never met me before, you might 157 “On the Internet …” 158 just think that was a really good picture, taken before I’d put on some weight and lost a little hair.”*  

- Page 120 (location ~ 1840-1845)    

*Recovering From a Faux Pas 160 Everyone, no matter how slick, commits social blunders from time to time. The key is to recover from them gracefully, which is usually done by bemoaning your error in some humorous fashion. In fact, if you can come back smoothly enough, you’ll come across even better than had you not stumbled in the first place. This is not to suggest that you purposely make the errors described in this section. But the following chapters are worth studying, because as surely as you’re reading this sentence, you’ll need to recover from a faux pas at some point. You can’t just deny that you made a social mistake; this just compounds your error. But you needn’t hang your head in shame and act mortified, either. To err is human; to poke fun at oneself afterward, divinely charming.*  

- Page 121 (location ~ 1846-1853)    

*If you say something that makes you sound superficial, the best way to recover is to shrug, “I’m very shallow you know.” Your prey will understand, because we’re all superficial at times. (Who among us is immune to beauty?) Explain, “Some people judge others by whether they’re kind, thoughtful, and sensitive. I don’t care about those things. With me, all that matters is whether you’re good-looking and have money.” Say, “I’m a firm believer in judging a book by its cover.” Take the opportunity to compliment your prey: “Hey, I wouldn’t even be talk- ing to you if you weren’t so good-looking.”*  

- Page 121 (location ~ 1854-1859)    

*SITUATION: You’ve just said something superficial, and your prey gives you a mini-lecture about the importance of having good values. STIFF: “I know.” BOOR: “Fuck off, good values are for losers.” CHARMER: “When people talk about having good values, I always figure they mean ‘good value,’ as in getting a lot for your money.”*  

- Page 122 (location ~ 1863-1866)    

*We all get nastier than we should from time to time. When that hap- pens, we must own up to our own nastiness, and then show remorse, lest we be mistaken for truly evil. (Only villains admit to their own vil-lainy with gleeful egotism.) So shake your head and say: “Ouch—am I really that bitchy?” “I seem to be full of poison and jealousy. No milk of human kind- ness here.” “You have to consider the source. By my standards, that was actually flattery—I’m usually much meaner.”*  

- Page 122 (location ~ 1867-1872)    

*SITUATION: You’ve just blurted out that you hope your worst enemy gets cancer and dies. STIFF: “I guess I shouldn’t have said that.” BOOR: “And I hope it’s a slow, agonizing death.” CHARMER: “One of these days, I’m actually going to find something nice to say about somebody. Maybe I shouldn’t, though, because the people who know me would probably have heart attacks.”*  

- Page 123 (location ~ 1875-1879)    

*SITUATION: You’ve just playfully shoved your friend, causing him to unexpectedly trip and fall fairly hard on his rear end. STIFF: “Oops, sorry.” BOOR: “You klutz!” CHARMER: “You know, Hulk Hogan got a lot of his moves from me.”*  

- Page 124 (location ~ 1893-1896)    

*When Your Ego Shows Sometimes, especially if you’re male, the occasional boast will just come bursting out, despite your best intentions. (The male ego is a rav-enous creature that needs constant feeding.) After you’ve blurted out some such comment, when the sour stench of your egotism hangs heavy, use one of these lines to clear the air: “Oops. My ego just reared its ugly head again. I’ve got to keep that thing on a shorter leash.” “Sorry, I have the male curse—rampant egotism.” “A naked ego really is a hideously ugly thing, isn’t it?” “On my worst days, and this seems to be one of those, I can make Donald Trump look humble and unassuming.” “My need for self-affirmation is pathetic, isn’t it?” “I’ve got to stop boasting. I’ve got to stop boasting. I’ve got to stop boasting. My psychiatrist told me that if I say that three times after each boast, it’ll cure me.” “My ego is like a second head attached to my shoulders—I don’t want it, and it repulses people, but it’s there, and there doesn’t seem to be anything I can do about it.”*  

- Page 124 (location ~ 1896-1906)    

*If You’ve Been Caught Kissing Ass There are some situations where a certain amount of toadying is unavoidable, whether it’s with your boss, your customer, your in-laws, your spouse, or even someone you genuinely admire. In fact, much of this book is about how to kiss ass, because to the kissee it’s generally a pleasant experience; it is only to the third party who witnesses it that it is so off-putting. So if your prey happens to be that witness, it’s best to put a little distance between yourself and your behavior. As is usually the case, the best way to lessen the embarrassment is to point out what you’ve done. Say, “Kissing ass just seems to come naturally to me.” Or, “Some people are born leaders.” Shrug, “I’m a born follower.” “I hate myself. That’s why I abase myself this way.”*  

- Page 127 (location ~ 1944-1951)    

*If You’ve Overreacted We all overreact at times, and, as a result, look temperamental. But you can keep yourself from being permanently enshrined in the Twit Hall of Fame with a little self-acknowledgment. Start by saying, “Guess I overreacted a touch.” Or, “There’s no excuse for me to act like such a twit. Guess I owe someone an apology.” “My specialty is creating tempests in teapots.” “That’s pretty much the story of my life: much ado about nothing.”*  

- Page 130 (location ~ 1980-1984)    

*One comment you want to avoid is, “Well, there goes my credibil- ity,” because, while that describes what your prey’s reaction should be, you don’t want to encourage it. SITUATION: You’ve just been caught in a lie by your prey. STIFF: “Well, you caught me.” BOOR: “You trying to tell me you never lied?” CHARMER: “You’re a mind reader. I bet nobody gets anything by you.”*  

- Page 131 (location ~ 2008-2012)    

*SITUATION: Your prey says, “The only reason you suggested a game of chess was so you could show off.” STIFF: “No—I just enjoy chess!” BOOR: “Nah, I just didn’t realize you were going to suck so bad.” CHARMER: “You caught me. But you’ve got to realize—I only did it because you’re so much better than me in everything else.”*

*“Like to hear that one more time?” “Anyway, and so on, ad nauseum, I guess.” “My motto is, never say in twenty-five words what can be said in two hundred and fifty.” “To me, brevity is a dirty word.” “Can I get anybody some coffee? How about smelling salts?” “If anyone here suffers from insomnia, I’m selling tapes of myself talking for five dollars.” No matter how long you’ve gone on, if you end with a self-depreca- tory comment about your verbosity, you’ll leave an impression of charm.*

*When You’ve Repeated Yourself We all have a certain stock of anecdotes and jokes that we trot out from time to time; inevitably, some will get repeated to the same person. If you’re not sure your prey has heard a story before, it’s safest to ask him at the outset. But if you forget and blunder through the entire thing, you must acknowledge the fact afterward: “I’ve told you that story before, haven’t I? And you’re so polite, you just sat through the entire thing without saying a word.” “Next time, please stop me before I humiliate myself that way.” “Well, I guess you’re becoming acquainted with the limits of my repertoire.” “I only have a few stories, so I have to milk them for all they’re worth.”*

*“You know, of all the great love stories in history … Antony and Cleopatra … Romeo and Juliet … I think this one is actually the most intense.” When your prey asks which one you’re talking about, reply matter-of-factly, “You know, me and the mirror.”*  

- Page 135 (location ~ 2064-2067)    

*SITUATION: You’re caught primping in front of the mirror. What do you do? STIFF: Quickly runs his hand through his hair to make it look as if he had been making sure his hair wasn’t too unkempt. BOOR: Ignores prey, keeps primping. CHARMER: “This is encouraging. Usually when I look in a mirror, it cracks.”*

*If You Were Tongue-Tied It happens to all of us: there are moments when the right words just won’t come. Unfortunately, these times tend to occur when you least want them to. Should your prey happen to witness such muteness on your part, this is what to say afterward: “I always get that deer-in-the-headlights response. Just lucky, I guess.” “Freezing up is one of my specialties.” “In case you were wondering, that was me at my most eloquent.” “I always come up with the perfect response—half an hour later.”*

*Aretha Franklin probably phrased it best when she said she wanted R-E-S-P-E-C-T. It’s what all of us want. And there’s no better way to give it to your prey than to put him above you, in whichever arenas self-respect is measured. So go ahead and elevate him by being deferential. Keep in mind that your emphasis here should always be on his attributes, not your lack of them. (The better you are, the better it makes him.)*  

- Page 138 (location ~ 2107-2111)    

*SITUATION: Your prey proudly mentions that he bench-pressed three hundred pounds. STIFF: “Is that good?” BOOR: “That’s nothing. My own cousin can bench four-twenty.” CHARMER: “The other day, I benched a hundred pounds three times. Same thing, right?”*  

- Page 139 (location ~ 2129-2132)    

*Telling another guy he is very attractive to women is the compliment he most wants to hear. And nothing makes the compliment seem more sincere than bemoaning your own lack of success with the opposite sex at the same time. “Man, you could have any woman you want!” pretty much sounds like the keys to heaven. “I bet your biggest problem is how to get rid of them all afterward. Do you have an unlisted phone number? I bet even then you’d have to change that from time to time.” “What’s it like to have the fish jump out of the water and into your boat?”*  

- Page 140 (location ~ 2133-2139)    

*Tell your prey, “I wish I had as much testosterone going through my system as you do. Guys like me always have to go around proving their masculinity, whereas you can just calmly sit back and feel secure, because nobody would ever doubt your masculinity.” “I bet the football coaches must have really drooled over you in high school.” If he played football, ask if he ever put the shot or threw the discus, in a tone that indicates complete assurance that had he tried, he could have set the world record in either one.*  

- Page 141 (location ~ 2154-2158)    

*SITUATION: Your prey attempts some feat of strength and fails. STIFF: “I probably couldn’t do that either.” BOOR: “Hah! You weakling!” CHARMER: “Okay, who’s got the Kryptonite?”*  

- Page 142 (location ~ 2168-2169)    

*When your tall and handsome prey greets you by asking how you are, answer, “Same way I always feel when I’m around you—short and ugly.” Tailor your comments to whatever his strengths and your relative weaknesses are. Some other possible answers might be: “Same way I always feel when I’m around you—fat and awkward.” “… slow and charmless.” “… unsuccessful and unsophisticated.” “… shabbily dressed and poorly groomed.”*  

- Page 142 (location ~ 2170-2175)    

*SITUATION: Your prey has just greeted you by asking how you are. STIFF: “Fine thanks, and you?” BOOR: “Don’t tell me you give a shit.” CHARMER: “Same way I always feel around you—poor and stupid.”*  

- Page 142 (location ~ 2177-2179)    

*Say, “I made five thousand dollars in the stock market last month. To someone like you, that’s nothing, but to me, that’s a lot of money.” Once your prey has been placed in such an exalted position, it’s much easier for him to praise you; he will undoubtedly respond by saying, “Oh no, five thousand dollars is a lot of money for me, too. Congratulations.” This allows him to not only feel like a big success, but gives him the opportunity to act humble and magnanimous as well. You’ve managed to get your boasting in without making him feel the need to one-up you. And you don’t even seem that boastful because you couched your boast in relative terms.*  

- Page 148 (location ~ 2260-2266)    

*So instead of either arguing or even admitting your own stupidity, turn the focus onto him. Positive comments about his comment are always welcome: “That’s a great suggestion.” “As always, you cut right to the heart of the matter.” “I should have known I could count on you to analyze the situation accurately.” “You’re very insightful.” SITUATION: After you finish outlining a plan, your prey points out an obvious flaw you hadn’t thought of. STIFF: “Oh … That’s true, I guess.” BOOR: “Don’t you think I already thought of that? I was going to get to that!” CHARMER: “That’s a very good point. A very good point.”*

*Being Cool 211 Some people are just naturally cool, and nothing fazes them; the rest of us must pretend. This is perhaps the hardest act to pull off, because it requires conquering your emotions. It is virtually impossible not to get angry when you’ve been insulted; but if you can pretend not to be, you’ll come across cool. And if you act this way, you may find yourself actually getting less angry. Remaining totally unaffected when someone else is raging is by far the most eloquent way of saying that you simply don’t care enough about them to be upset by their opinions. If you can demonstrate this sort of noncha-lance in front of your prey (preferably to a third party rather than to him), he will think you the ultimate in cool.*

*SITUATION: Someone tells you you’re a failure in life. STIFF: “How dare you?” BOOR: “Hey, I’d rather be me than an asshole like you!” CHARMER: (calmly) “Am I ever. I’m surprised you’re not embar- rassed to be seen with me.”*  

- Page 156 (location ~ 2377-2380)    

*So put your hand over your heart and open your mouth as if in shock, then use a mild-but-exaggerated tone as you give voice to any combination of the following lines: “Wow! You are really mean!” “I can’t believe you said that!” “Have I done anything to deserve that type of treatment?” “Don’t you think I have any feelings?” “I think I’m going to cry.” (Use this one only if you’re obviously not.) You will simultaneously show that your prey’s insult registered, giv- ing him satisfaction, and that you really weren’t affected by it. SITUATION: Your prey has just told you that nobody at school likes you. STIFF: (recoiling) “What?” BOOR: (livid) “You think people like you, you piece of shit?” CHARMER: (with exaggerated concern) “Why don’t you just cut my heart out and feed it to the crows? I can’t believe how cruel you are.”*

*Stay Calm It is a law of physics that you cannot be hysterical and charming at the same time. Even if you feel like losing your temper or having a nervous breakdown, remain an icebox on the outside. Someone who stays level-headed while others panic inspires confidence. And if you can stay cool while all about you are losing their heads, it will add a certain heroic quality to your charm. Case in point. The fire alarm at your school or office has gone off, and the smell of smoke informs you that it’s not just another drill. Yet the line in the stairwell is not moving, leaving you trapped on the sev-enth floor. Instead of screaming at people to move, toss off a light- hearted line: “Now I know how Joan of Arc felt.”*

*SITUATION: Your prey has stopped by your office to drop something off. STIFF: “Well, this is where I work.” BOOR: “I’ve done so much for this company, they oughta have a statue of me out in the front hall.” CHARMER: “This is where I pretend to be a grownup. It gets a little wearying, trust me.”*

*Don’t Try Too Hard to Prove Your Masculinity Too many guys spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to prove to their buddies that they’re heterosexual. You may have succumbed to this sort of peer pressure yourself. The problem is, trying too hard just makes you look insecure, not masculine. It also makes you look a bit stupid. In fact, there is nothing more masculine than not worrying about appearing masculine. Real tough guys never feel the need to prove their toughness, and real studs never worry about how studly they appear. So the key to appearing confident is to simply relax.*  

- Page 162 (location ~ 2470-2476)    

*Another ironically macho-sounding comment during an argument with your buddy is, “If I’m wrong, I’ll crawl around this entire stadium on my hands and knees and then blow you in front of everybody.” (Don’t worry, he won’t take you up on it.) If you know a gay man, don’t be afraid to talk to him in front of the guys. Apart from the fact that it’s rude not to, it will make you appear secure.*

*If someone announces the earth is flat, shrug, “That’s why I never go sailing. Don’t want to fall off the edge.” If somebody says the moon is made of green cheese, respond, ear- nestly, “Somebody should look into sending an expedition to attach some ropes to that thing and drag it back to earth. We could eradicate world hunger.”*

*Don’t Complain You want to be such a calm presence that your prey finds it soothing simply to be around you. If you find yourself in a restaurant with slow service, don’t go there again. But for heaven’s sake, don’t make it worse for your prey by carp-ing and kvetching about it. Simply steer the conversation to more pleasant pastures, where your prey can feast on your knowledge and charm while he waits for his food to arrive. You and your prey are looking something*

*SITUATION: You and your prey are stuck in the middle of a traffic jam; your car has moved exactly nine feet in the last twenty minutes. STIFF: “This really stinks.” BOOR: Repeatedly honks his horn, although it does no good. When the driver ahead of him makes a helpless gesture, he gives him the finger and mutters darkly, “Asshole.” CHARMER: (calmly) “This would be bad, but I’m always happy to have the opportunity to spend more time with you.”*

*SITUATION: Your prey has just made the final cut for the cheerlead- ing squad and you’ve been cut. What do you say to her? STIFF: “Congratulations.” BOOR: “The only reason they chose you over me is because your mom is on the school board.” CHARMER: “I’m so happy for you! I’m just so glad that at least one of us could make it!”*
