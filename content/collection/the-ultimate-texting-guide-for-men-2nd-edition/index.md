*First, the great part about attraction is that Attraction is an uncontrollable feeling and it’s a biological response. Women don’t logically feel attracted to a man. They have a gut-level emotional response that creates attraction. Women need to feel attraction in order to desire and fall in love. What do you think is the best way to trigger these emotions? I have found that experiences or thinking of an experience is the best way. Obviously, you can’t physically experience being playful with a woman via text; but you can, however, give her those same feelings that come with playing.*

*Think of how reality TV shows are using this model. Reality shows are always simple, easy-going situations and everything goes just dandy… Not even close! People want the intensity of feeling the ups and downs in the show - we love watching the arguments and then we love watching them settle down and make friends again. Feeling is strongly connected to your breathing. Next time you are with a woman, notice your own breathing when talking to her and your rise and fall in your emotional state. Observe this, as well in the women you interact with. Say something that gets them to hold their breath in anticipation, and then let her feel relieved to exhale and breathe again. Women are hoping to find guys to give them this emotional roller coaster. What makes riding on a street bike so appealing to a woman? Put yourself in her place. She is giving up her control to you. She may be a little nervous and reluctant, but the excitement is too intriguing*

*Women thrive off emotion or chemical interactions. Stimulate their feelings; take them on an emotional roller coaster and make sure you keep her on her toes. Try to keep it positive, but remember, negative feelings can be good too. Keep it light and fun and then jump into serious stuff and then back to light and fun. Whatever you do, don’t be boring. Boredom is one of greatest fears in life. Why is that? Because there is no feeling in boredom. Point here is: think about creating some kind of feeling in all of your text messages.*

*Men succeed in texting because they are aware of what women respond desirably to and can think about what they’re going to say and be creative about it. Texting is perfect for developing better skills in communicating with women. I say this because women are generally more experienced communicators. So being able to think about what you’re going to say and saying it the right way gives you a great advantage.*

*She has many options and so you must at least be on her mind logistically. When you want to meet up with her, especially if it’s the first time, give her a call and talk to her. This alone tells her that you’re a man and not a wuss. Now, when you do call her, remember to feel and act natural. Relax and be yourself. Normally guys aren’t themselves around women - they change. This is because beautiful women cause a response in men. If a woman is attractive to us then we want to be pleasing to her and seek her approval. Notice how most men communicate to really good-looking women. They give the woman all of their attention, are agreeable and their body orients or mirrors the woman’s. Men think that if they are nice and pleasing to her then she will like them. This obviously doesn’t work. Most men treat exceptionally good-looking women with higher value or status than themselves. This will almost always turn a woman off. A woman cannot feel attraction if you are lower status than her.*

*Not knowing where you belong creates status anxiety, which women don’t respond to very well. So being comfortable with who you are and not seeking approval or trying to fit in, will give you higher status. Let others conform to you. You are the leader of your life. Have this mindset when talking and texting a woman. Talk like you’re just friends and you don’t need her to be happy. You are the source of your own happiness. Having this presence will be very attractive to women especially the exceptional ones. When you’re talking to her comfortably, it will give her the go ahead that she can relax, feel safe and open up to connect with you. She knows through your texts that you are fun, so she’ll have a better attitude altogether. But do call her at times to meet up and at random to show you are a confident man to create a better transition for when you meet up.*

*Text messaging is where qualifying and the “game” come into play. Women are great at sending mixed messages, and they respond well when men do it to them. Sending mixed messages will get a woman wondering if you are serious or joking - like texting, “You’re fun! Especially when you just stand there looking bored and not saying anything.” Put things in perspective. She is not around you and is most likely in a logical state of mind. You must come across un-needy. You are busy with your own life and may think about her from time to time. If you decide to let her know this, then text “Hey, I was just thinking about you.” Usually, that’s all you would say. You don’t miss her. If she replies back then you have a choice to either respond or just talk to her later and leave her hanging. Her text should be the last one sent if you do end up responding.*  

- Page 17 (location ~ 249-256)    

*Keep your texts as short as possible spicing it up with wit and other emotionally charged words. Like when I give a girl a compliment, I sort of take it away at the same time or challenge them. I’ll text something like “Yeah you’re fun… so far.” or “You’re actually cute… when you’re not whining.” or in reverse “Stop whining… even if you are good looking.”*

*How to avoid the wrong women in your life. You deserve the best! Don’t ever settle. Always work on improving yourself and understanding others. It’s never too late to be the man you always wanted to be and have that girl of your dreams. If you want to have quality women in your life, then you must feel at a deep level that you are worthy of them and deserve their love.*  

- Page 20 (location ~ 294-297)    

*• How do I create closeness and comfort? Speak to her like you’re already friends. Talk to her as if she’s right there. Most women are natural followers and respond to what you do and say. So you must be comfortable in order for the woman to feel comfortable. You can say almost anything to your friends and not worry about what they think - do the same when it comes to women. Listen to her and ask her questions on what she is talking about - this will relax her.*  

- Page 20 (location ~ 299-302)    

*Let her know you’re the man. So if she says you’re good at something just continue and say, “Thanks, I’m glad you noticed.” Or “Yea, I’m good at everything I do.” Or you could play it on a more humble side, “Yea I get that a lot.” Just make sure you own it. She is actually testing you to see if you can be confident in yourself, never say, “No I’m not, just luck.” You will lose the second you say this and she will move on.*  

- Page 23 (location ~ 350-354)    

*What do you do if a woman is trying to get something out of you? If she wants you to do something for her I keep it simple and call her out and say, “You’re just here to use me.” It almost always works if you call a woman out on something she is trying to get away with - especially the good-looking women. If she asks for something, and you know she’s trying to milk it with her looks, I’ll approach it tactfully and say something like, “I would, but your face isn’t pretty enough to get that from me.” It seems mean, but those kind of women love it because no guy treats them like that and it gives them a challenge.*

*Role reversals are great flirting techniques. Like saying, “Just as long as you make enough money to support both of us.” Or “Hey honey how are the kids?” Playhouse and pretending relationships are a girl’s favorite past time. Why not bring a familiar feeling back. It sets a good tone and is a lot of fun. The Ultimate Texting Guide*

*Talk to women in a fun way with no agenda. This was always hard for me at first because I don’t naturally talk to girls just to talk. I have now learned that having something fun and interesting to talk about, asking questions and keeping it flirty and emotionally charged always keeps me interested in conversations. If you want to be interesting, be interested. Don’t interview her, but be genuinely interested in who she is and what makes her unique.*  

- Page 26 (location ~ 395-398)    

*Bantering - is to speak to or address in a witty and teasing manner. Easy for one-liners but more effective if a bantering interaction is played out. This is a great way to qualify her to see if she can play around. So saying something like “Hey honey, I’m going to be in late tonight, make sure Jimmy gets his bath.” Women always played house growing up and this is a great way to slide into that role and have fun. By setting up roles, we can now play them out and have those feelings and attitudes associated with them. Women love this. A lot of women also have a naughty side or guilty pleasure to them, so if you let them play out this role they will find you exciting to be around as they are able to express themselves.*

*Arrogant humor - also known as cocky funny. Arrogance is having an attitude of superiority manifested in an overbearing manner or in presumptuous claims or assumptions. Saying “I’m the hottest guy here” is cocky and arrogant. Saying “I’m probably the best looking guy you’ve ever seen so you might want to take a picture” is cocky, but in a humorous way. Joking around and having a good time is the number one attraction secret. Women always rate humor as the number one thing they look for in a man. Laughter is the best way to share time and create connections with others. People generally laugh for two reasons: because something is done out of the ordinary, or because of nervousness. Your body can’t hold nervousness if you are laughing. So anytime you’re around women, it’s a good idea to do fun things that evoke laughter to help both of you relax. Now on the other hand, if you’re too funny, then you’ll end up being her entertaining, little monkey. And if you’re too cocky you’ll be seen as a prick.*

*Playful Teasing - this is just what boys do to girls. Think back in your early childhood when you chased girls around the playground pulling their pigtails. This is universal flirting and you see it all around you.*  

- Page 32 (location ~ 481-483)    

*example, if they dyed their hair, kind of squint your eyes as if you’re noticing something wrong with it and say something like, “How do you get your roots so dark?” or “Huh, do you like it?” If a really attractive woman knocks over a drink, say “looks like you owe me a drink… after you clean up your mess.” Treat her like your bratty little sister, and that you could care less what she thinks. The key is to get her to laugh at herself. It’s great to expose a woman’s insecurities and have her laugh about them. I’ve even said to girls that they are boring and that they had to prove to me that they know how to be fun. Women love attention and a challenge at the same time. So regulate that attention by either not giving them any or just playfully teasing them so they can almost feel like you’re possibly pursuing them. If you do it right, you will always be happy you teased her.*  

- Page 32 (location ~ 489-495)    

*Secret text tip, exercise the word “NO” The word NO is a very attractive word to women, especially if they are good looking. It shows that you are picky, you have an opinion, you are a qualifier and you are in control. If she asks, “Do you want to go do this?” and you don’t want to, just say, “no, do you want to?” Or let’s say she wants to meet up and you can’t, instead of saying “oh I can’t sorry” say, “No, next week will be better.” It’s a very powerful word because the word NO internally triggers a challenge.*

*Bonus Section #6 Making the phone call It will be a lot easier to call her because you’ve already been texting and communicating with her. Calling is also another great way to transition smoothly into the real world and meet. This is a crucial step in meeting up with a woman. For many men this step can be very difficult. You can get that feeling of anxiety where you are not sure exactly what to say or hope that she is not busy and you get her at a good time. There are thousands of things to worry about. I know, I’ve been there before myself. And now, I don’t think about it. When I get a minute, I will call her and actually tell her I had a minute and wanted to talk to her. It doesn’t really matter what you say as long as you are calm and collected. Don’t let yourself think about it and get all worked up and nervous.*

*4. Have a plan Never say, “What do you want to do?” This is not the role of a man and most women don’t like to take the position of the decision maker. A real man will confidently take her by the hand and make something happen. Things to do… • Go shopping for a trip you’re going on • See a movie • You’re hungry and are getting something to eat • Go out to a bar or social scene*  

- Page 54 (location ~ 827-831)    

*5. Make sure you end the call first Always end the conversation before you run into talking about each other and your lives, or before an uncomfortable pause happens.*  

- Page 55 (location ~ 842-843)    

*Decoding a woman’s text It’s important you understand that you are really not decoding a woman’s text, but rather confidently handling the situations and moving the conversation. For the most part, women are responders and men are initiators. Women might test, send you a mixed signal or whatever, but she will change based on the confidence that comes out of you. Your job is to not be affected by her and keep doing your thing. If she is sending a text message that is iffy and you are not sure what is going on, then Withdraw Your Interest. If a woman says, “something came up and I can’t make it” I usually don’t respond back because she is not giving me any counter offer. So I withdraw my interest. You can try calling her out and say she’s lame or say she’s going to miss out. But for something like that, I usually just leave it and put nothing.*  

- Page 56 (location ~ 858-864)    

*Understand what she really means I don’t bother with this too much because I just assume that she wants to see me and might be a little insecure about it. The person that cares the least has the most power. So you’re going to live your life and be happy regardless of her. You are merely sharing that with her.*  

- Page 57 (location ~ 872-875)    

*What to say back If you don’t know what to say, then don’t say anything at that particular moment. Silence is the best answer. Don’t get emotionally involved in what she is saying; if you act from emotion, then you are reacting instead of responding.*  

- Page 58 (location ~ 875-877)    

*Responding correctly to the hardest texts she will put on you Either don’t answer and ignore it or try to look at things from a different perspective. The best perspective is where your happiness comes first. So if she says “Do you like me?” say “Well I’m still getting to know you” or “Yes… as a friend” or “Yeah you’re nice” Let’s say she asks you a question you don’t want her knowing the answer to, like say you had a date last night and she says, “What did you do last night.” You can either ignore her and talk about something else or just say, “I was talking to all of the dancers at the strip club to see if you were any good for me.” If she says, no really just say, “Yeah and later we all had a huge orgy, you missed out” Don’t give in, she doesn’t really want to know.*

*Safety concerns for text messaging Texting has an impersonal and unsafe side because you can never be sure who is on the other side. The points below are helpful tips to think about when texting and using your phone: • Don't ever text personal information such as your PIN number, password, or banking information to anyone. Remember, once you send that information to another person, it gets stored in their cell phone. I’ve heard of a few accounts where a guy/girl stole someone’s phone and text messaged all the people on the phone and got valuable information.*  

- Page 59 (location ~ 899-903)    

*Putting a password on your phone keeps others from accessing your text logs or email. This will also prevent thieves from stealing information stored in your phone.*  

- Page 60 (location ~ 908-909)    

*Don't forget to erase all your personal data before selling, recycling or donating your old phone. Many people are still under the impression that taking out your SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card will do the trick, but that's not entirely true. Most Cingular and T-mobile phones have SIM cards while some other carriers use a RUIM (Removable User Identity Module). You'll need a series of codes to permanently delete stored information. For this, find out if your phone has a "master reset" feature, which wipes out all the stored data at once.*
