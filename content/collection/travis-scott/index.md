Jacques Webster, Travis $cott, is an artist that frequently reminds me to strive towards my goals and work on my habits.  Putting out high-energy relatable vibes consistently, I look to emulate this effort to channel creative waves into tracks that you'll love and hate. You can find some of my favourite bars by him _below_.
