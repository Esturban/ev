Jacques Webster, [Travis $cott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott), is an artist that frequently reminds me to strive towards my goals and work on my habits.  Putting out high-energy relatable vibes consistently -- I look to emulate this effort to channel creative waves into tracks that you'll love and hate. You can find some of my favourite bars by him _below_.

# What Travis $cott Taught me  
  
If it's anything I have learned from Jacques, it's that your effort needs to be consistent and encouraging for everything life has to offer.  Whether that be the finer things one might appreciate, the women of interest in your life or the energy placed into each track with your soundman working over time when you're after making a big splash in the music industry in an effort to change it forever.
