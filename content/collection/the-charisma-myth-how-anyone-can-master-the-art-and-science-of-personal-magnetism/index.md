*“After dining with Mr. Gladstone, I thought he was the cleverest person in England. But after dining with Mr. Disraeli, I thought I was the cleverest person in England.” Guess who won the election? It was the man who made others feel intelligent, impressive, and fascinating: Benjamin Disraeli. Consciously or not, charismatic individuals choose specific behaviors that make other people feel a certain way. These behaviors can be learned and perfected by anyone. In fact, in controlled laboratory experiments, researchers*

*It is also a myth that you have to be attractive to be charismatic. Countless charismatic figures were far from fitting classic standards of beauty. Churchill was not generally considered handsome and certainly not known for his sex appeal. And yet he was one of history’s most influential and powerful leaders. Yes, good looks do confer some advantage. But it’s very possible to be charismatic without a striking face or figure. In fact, charisma itself will make you more attractive. When instructed to exhibit specific charismatic behaviors in controlled experiments, participants’ levels of attractiveness were rated significantly higher than before.*

*Through charisma training you will learn how to adopt a charismatic posture, how to warm up your eye contact, and how to modulate your voice in ways that make people pay attention. Three quick tips to gain an instant charisma boost in conversation: Lower the intonation of your voice at the end of your sentences. Reduce how quickly and how often you nod. Pause for two full seconds before you speak.*

*CHARISMATIC BEHAVIOR CAN be broken down into three core elements: presence, power, and warmth. These elements depend both on our conscious behaviors and on factors we don’t consciously control. People pick up on messages we often don’t even realize we’re sending through small changes in our body language.*

*If you’re not fully present in an interaction, there’s a good chance that your eyes will glaze over or that your facial reactions will be a split-second delayed. Since the human mind can read facial expressions in as little as seventeen milliseconds,1 the person you’re speaking with will likely notice even the tiniest delays in your reactions. We may think that we can fake presence. We may think that we can fake listening. We believe that as long as we seem attentive, it’s okay to let our brains churn on other things. But we’re wrong. When we’re not fully present in an interaction, people will see it. Our body language sends a clear message that other people read and react to, at least on a subconscious level. You’ve surely had the experience of talking to someone who wasn’t really listening. Maybe they seemed to be just “going through the motions” of listening to you so you wouldn’t be offended. Somehow, they didn’t seem to be paying full attention. How did you feel then? Brushed off? Annoyed? Just plain bad? As a student in one of my Harvard lectures told me: “It happened recently when I was talking to someone—I felt she wasn’t really present. I felt resentful, inferior to whatever was more important to her than our conversation.”*

*Presence is a learnable skill. Like any other ability (from painting to playing the piano), you can increase it with practice and patience. Being present means simply having a moment-to-moment awareness of what’s happening. It*

*Presence is a learnable skill. Like any other ability (from painting to playing the piano), you can increase it with practice and patience. Being present means simply having a moment-to-moment awareness of what’s happening. It means paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your own thoughts.*

*Set the timer for one minute. Close your eyes and try to focus on one of the following three things: the sounds around you, your breathing, or the sensations in your toes. Sounds: Scan your environment for sound. As a meditation teacher told me, “Imagine that your ears are satellite dishes, passively and objectively registering sounds.” Your breath: Focus on your breath and the sensations it creates in your nostrils or stomach as it goes in and out. Pay attention to one breath at a time, but try to notice everything about this one breath. Imagine that your breath is someone you want to give your full attention to. Your toes: Focus your attention on the sensations in your toes. This forces your mind to sweep through your body, helping you to get into the physical sensations of the moment. So how did that go? Did you find your mind constantly wandering even though you were trying your best to be present? As you’ve noticed, staying fully present isn’t always easy. There are two main reasons for this. First, our brains are wired to pay attention to novel stimuli, whether they be sights, smells, or sounds. We’re wired to be distracted, to have our attention grabbed by any new stimulus: It could be important! It could eat us! This tendency was key to our ancestors’ survival. Imagine two tribesmen hunting through the plains, searching the horizon for signs of the antelope that could feed their family. Something flickers in the distance. The tribesman whose attention wasn’t immediately caught? He’s not our ancestor. The second reason is that our society encourages distraction. The constant influx of stimulation we receive worsens our natural tendencies. This can eventually lead us into a state of continuous partial attention, in which we never give our full attention to any single thing. We’re always partially distracted.*

*Don’t be discouraged if you feel that you didn’t fully succeed in the one-minute exercise above. You actually did gain a charisma boost right then and there simply by practicing presence. And because you’ve already gained the mindset shift (awareness of the importance of presence and the cost of the lack of it), you’re now already ahead of the game. If you were to stop right here and read nothing further, it would be well worth it. Here’s how this could play out for you in a practical, everyday setting. Let’s say a colleague walks into your office, wanting your opinion on some matter. You have only a few minutes to spare before your next meeting, and you’re worried that this might take more time than you have. If you let your mind continue churning away while he’s talking to you, not only will you feel anxious and have a hard time concentrating, you’ll also give the impression that you’re restless and not fully present. Your colleague might conclude that you don’t care enough about him or his problem to really pay attention. If instead you remember to use one of the quick fixes—focusing for just a second on your breath or your toes—this will instantly bring you back to the present moment. This full presence will show in your eyes and your face, and will be seen by the person who’s talking to you. By giving them just a few moments of full presence, they will feel respected and listened to. When you’re fully present, it shows in your body language in a highly charisma-enhancing way.*

*Increasing your ability to be present not only improves your body language, listening skills, and mental focus, it could even enhance your ability to enjoy life. Too often when a special moment arrives, such as a celebration or even a few minutes of quality time with a loved one, our mind is running in six different directions. Meditation teacher Tara Brach has made the practice of being present a lifetime study. Here’s how she puts it: “In most moments we have a continuous internal commentary on what is happening and what we should do next. We might greet a friend with a hug, but the warmth of our greeting becomes blurred by our computations about how long to embrace or what we’re going to say when we’re done. We rush through the motions, not fully present.” Being present enables you to fully notice and drink in the good moments.*

*Being seen as powerful means being perceived as able to affect the world around us, whether through influence on or authority over others, large amounts of money, expertise, intelligence, sheer physical strength, or high social status. We look for clues of power in someone’s appearance, in others’ reaction to this person, and, most of all, in the person’s body language. Warmth, simply put, is goodwill toward others. Warmth tells us whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in our favor. Being seen as warm means being perceived as any of the following: benevolent, altruistic, caring, or willing to impact our world in a positive way. Warmth is assessed almost entirely through body language and behavior; it’s evaluated more directly than power. How do we gauge power and warmth? Imagine that you’re meeting someone for the first time. In most instances you don’t have the benefit of an extensive background check, interviews with friends or relatives, or even the time to wait and observe their behavior. So in most instances you have to make a quick guess. Throughout our interactions, we instinctively look for clues with which to evaluate warmth or power, and then we adjust our assumptions accordingly. Expensive clothing leads us to assume wealth, friendly body language leads us to assume good intentions, a confident posture leads us to assume the person has something to be confident about. In essence, people will tend to accept whatever you project.*

*Today, there are many ways to be perceived as powerful, from displaying intelligence (think Bill Gates) to displaying kindness (think the Dalai Lama). But in the earliest days of human history, one form of power was predominant: brute force. Yes, intelligence was valuable, but much less than it is today—it’s hard to imagine Bill Gates faring well in the jungle. Few of those who gained positions of power through raw strength and aggression would have also exhibited much warmth. The combination of power and warmth would have been very rare and very, very precious: a powerful person who also viewed us kindly could mean the difference between life and death in critical moments. Figuring out who might want to help us and who has the power to do so has always been critical to our survival. That’s why our reaction to power and warmth is wired so deep. We react to these qualities as we do to fat and sugar. Our ancestors survived by having a strong positive reaction to fat and sugar—they aided our survival and were scarce in our original environment. Though they’re abundant today, our instinct remains. The same holds true for charisma: though the combination of warmth and power is far easier for people to attain today, it still plays powerfully on our instincts. From lab experiments to neuroimaging, research has consistently shown that they are the two dimensions we evaluate first and foremost in assessing other people.*

*After extensive studies, the MIT Media Lab concluded that it could predict the outcome of negotiations, telephone sales calls, and business plan pitches with 87 percent accuracy simply by analyzing participants’ body language, without listening to a single word of content.4 Though this may sound incredible—how could words carry so little weight compared to the body language of the person delivering them?—it actually makes sense. In the scope of human evolution, language is a relatively recent invention. But we’ve been interacting well before this through nonverbal modes of communication. As a result, nonverbal communication is hardwired into our brains, much deeper than the more recent language-processing abilities.*  

- Page 22 (location ~ 334-340)    

*For charisma, your body language matters far more than your words do. No matter how powerful your message or how skillfully crafted your pitch, if your body language is wrong, you won’t be charismatic. On the other hand, with the right body language you can be charismatic without saying a word. Projecting presence, power, and warmth through your body language is often all you need to be perceived as charismatic.*  

- Page 23 (location ~ 341-343)    

*There is far too much body language for us to control consciously. This has two consequences. First, because we can’t consciously control all of our body language, we can’t just broadcast charismatic body language at will. To get all the signals right, we’d need to simultaneously control thousands of elements, from minute vocal fluctuations to the precise degree and kind of tension around our eyes. It’s practically impossible. We can’t micromanage charismatic body language. On the other hand, since our subconscious is responsible for most of our nonverbal signals, if we could direct our subconscious appropriately, then the issue would be solved. (Hint: we can, and you’ll learn how.) The second consequence is that our body language expresses our mental state whether we like it or not. Our facial expressions, voice, posture, and all the other components of body language reflect our mental and emotional condition every second. Because we don’t control this flow consciously, whatever is in our head will show up in our body language. Even if we control the main expression on our face or the way we hold our arms, legs, or head, if our internal state is different from what we’re aiming to portray, sooner or later what’s called a microexpression will flash across our face. These split-second microexpressions may be fleeting, but they will be caught by observers (remember, people can read your face in as little as seventeen milliseconds). And if there’s an incongruence between our main expression and that microexpression, people will feel it on a subconscious level: their gut will tell them something’s not quite right.*

*Because what’s in your mind shows up in your body and because people will catch even the briefest microexpression, to be effective, charismatic behaviors must originate in your mind. If your internal state is anticharismatic, no amount of effort and willpower can make up for it. Sooner or later, some of your underlying thoughts and feelings will show through. On the other hand, if your internal state is charismatic, then the right body language will flow forth effortlessly. Thus, the first step in learning charisma—and what the first part of this book is all about—is developing the various mental states that produce charismatic body language and behaviors. We will start by gaining some insight into charismatic mental states—what they are, how to best access them, and how to fully integrate them so they become effortless. Only afterward will we start practicing external charismatic behaviors. Learning these skills in the reverse order could lead to embarrassing results. Imagine that you’re giving an important presentation. You’re doing well, using all the great new tools you’ve learned, being incredibly charismatic. And then suddenly, someone says something that rattles your mental focus and shakes your emotional confidence. You become flustered, and all your newly acquired skills fly out the window. Striving to acquire external charisma skills without learning how to handle your internal world is like adding pretty balconies to a house with a weak foundation. It’s a nice touch, but at the first earthquake everything falls apart. If your internal state is in turmoil, it’s hard to remember, let alone use, the new skills you’ve just learned. Charismatic internal skills, which help you manage your internal*

*But what these executives need first and foremost are personal, internal skills. Individuals with strong internal skills are aware of what exactly is happening inside them and know how to handle it. They can recognize when their self-confidence has taken a hit and have the tools to get back to a confident state so that their body language remains charismatic. Here’s a self-rating diagram I often draw for the people I coach, from young associates to CEOs, asking them to evaluate themselves and their subordinates. Take a moment to rate your technical, external, and internal skills in the table below. I often see brilliant engineers described by others, and by themselves, as possessing high technical, medium external, and low internal skills. CEOs tend to self-report medium technical and internal skills but high external skills. And highly charismatic people often rate themselves low in technical skills but high in external and internal skills.*

*Have you ever felt your heart pounding during a horror movie? Consciously, you know it’s just a movie. You realize you are watching actors who are delighted to pretend they’re being murdered in exchange for a nice paycheck. Yet your brain sees blood and guts on the screen, so it sends you straight into fight-or-flight mode, releasing adrenaline into your system. Here’s how it works in practice: Think of your favorite piece of music. Now imagine dragging your fingernails across a chalkboard. Now imagine plunging your hand into a bucket of sand and feeling the grains crunch between your fingers. And now taste the difference between lemon and lime—which is more sour? There was no sand; there was no lemon. And yet, in response to a set of completely imaginary events, your mind produced very real physical reactions. Because your brain cannot distinguish imagination from reality, imaginary situations cause your brain to send your body the same commands as it would for a real situation. Whatever your mind believes, your body will manifest. Just by getting into a charismatic mental state, your body will manifest a charismatic body language.*

*The placebo effect was discovered during World War I when medicine stores had run out and doctors found they could sometimes still ease their patients’ suffering by telling them that they had administered pain-relieving treatments. It became widely acknowledged during the 1950s as the medical community began running controlled clinical studies. Through much of human history, most of medicine was in fact pure placebo: doctors would prescribe potions or interventions that we now know to be fundamentally ineffective. Yet people’s conditions still often improved, thanks to the mind’s impressive ability to affect the body. The placebo effect can sometimes be remarkably powerful. Ellen Langer, a Harvard University professor of psychology, gathered a group of elderly patients in a nursing-home-like environment and surrounded them with the decor, clothing, food, and music that was popular when they were in their twenties. In the following weeks, physical exams showed tighter skin, better eyesight, increased muscle strength, and even higher bone density than before. The placebo effect is the basis for many of the best charisma-enhancing techniques, and we’ll refer to it often throughout the book. In fact, this is probably something you already do naturally, and many of the practices will make intuitive sense to you. In the following chapters, we’ll fine-tune this skill and make more powerful the internal processes you already use. The mind-over-body effect also has a corresponding downside, called the nocebo effect.7 In this case, the mind creates toxic consequences in the body in reaction to completely fictional causes. In one experiment, people who knew they were extremely allergic to poison ivy were rubbed with a completely harmless leaf but told they’d been exposed to poison ivy. Every single one of them developed a rash where they had been rubbed.*

*Charisma has three essential components: presence, power, and warmth. Being present—paying attention to what’s going on rather than being caught up in your thoughts—can yield immense rewards. When you exhibit presence, those around you feel listened to, respected, and valued. Because your body language telegraphs your internal state to those around you, in order to be charismatic—to exhibit presence, power, and warmth—you must display charismatic body language. Because your mind can’t tell the difference between imagination and reality, by creating a charismatic internal state your body language will authentically display charisma. In terms of achieving charisma, your internal state is critical. Get the internal state right, and the right charismatic behaviors and body language will pour forth automatically.*

*As you now know, your mental state is critical to your ability to project charismatic body language. However, there are a number of things that can—and often do—get in the way of having the right mental state to project presence, power, or warmth. Increasing your charisma requires first knowing which internal obstacles are currently inhibiting your personal charisma potential. In this chapter we’ll take a look at the different kinds of physical and mental discomfort that can stand in the way of your charismatic self.*

*Physical discomfort doesn’t just affect your external state; it also affects your internal state. Some forms of it, such as hunger, can impair your performance in multiple ways. You may already know that you think less clearly when you’re hungry, or at least less clearly about anything that isn’t food-related. Numerous studies confirm that low blood glucose levels lead to impaired attention as well as to difficulties regulating emotions and behavior.1 This means that you might have a harder time getting into the specific mental state required for the charismatic behavior you would like to exhibit. Counteracting charisma-impairing physical discomfort is simple: Prevent Recognize Remedy or explain The first, and optimal, step is to plan ahead to prevent the discomfort from occurring. The classic adage “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure” holds true here. As much as you can, plan ahead to ensure you’re physically comfortable. Keeping this in mind as you make your choices every day is a simple way to make charisma easier to attain. When you’re choosing a location for a meeting, take comfort into consideration. Ask yourself what the temperature and noise level will be like. Ensure that you’ll be well fed; don’t let yourself (or your guests if you’re hosting) get too hungry. Think about your energy level, and the energy level of the people with whom you’ll be interacting. Is the meeting very early or very late? Signs of fatigue can easily show up in people’s body language as lack of enthusiasm.*

Avoid clothing that is itchy, ill fitting, or in any way distracting. Though you may not realize it, any physical distraction will use up part of your mental focus and impair your performance. It’s particularly important to ensure that your clothing is loose enough for you to breathe well and fully (this means you can take deep belly breaths, not shallow chest breaths). How well you breathe affects how much oxygen gets to your brain, and therefore how well you perform mentally.*

*One young man told me his eyes are so sensitive to sunlight that even when he explains the real cause of his facial tension, the people he’s with often seem to doubt his explanation. On a gut level, they still feel there’s a problem between them. His solution is to assess the room before sitting down to make sure he won’t be facing the sun or to ask to change positions as soon as the sun becomes a problem. Because he is aware of this problem, he can take action before it affects the way he’s perceived. Awareness is the second step in dealing with physical discomfort. Check in with your face from time to time; notice if it is tense. This is where the ability to stay present will help you yet again: the more present you are, the better your chances of noticing if your body language is showing tension. The third step is to take action. If you realize that something has created tension in your face, do something about it. Before others misinterpret it, try to remedy both the discomfort as well as the misinterpretation. Let’s go back to that conversation on the terrace, when the sun was in Tom’s eyes. Now you know that he shouldn’t try to ignore his discomfort. Instead, he could act to explain and remedy the situation. When it’s his turn to speak, he could pause for a second, hold up a hand (the visual cue helps), and say something like: “Would you mind if we move just a bit? My eyes are having a hard time with the sunlight.” When the physical discomfort can’t be alleviated, it’s even more important to prevent other people from taking your tension personally. Take a moment to explain that you’re in discomfort due to a particular issue. For instance, if you’re feeling irritated by constant nearby construction noise, explain the problem. Giving voice to something will generally allow both of you to move on from*

*Though it originates entirely in the mind, psychological discomfort can play out through our bodies as well as through our minds. It affects both how we feel and how we’re perceived. Mental discomfort can result from anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, or self-doubt, all of which are forms of internal negativity, and each of which can handicap our personal charisma potential. Knowing how to skillfully handle mental discomfort is even more important than knowing how to handle physical discomfort. This is both one of the most challenging sections of the book and one of the most important. It may be difficult to process, but I promise you will benefit in the end. In fact, you’ll be much more powerful. You will have gained insights to put you ahead of the game, and you will have laid a foundation of understanding upon which the next sections will build. So brace yourself, take a deep breath, and read on.*

*For many of us, a state of doubt or uncertainty is an uncomfortable place to be. Robert Leahy, director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy, says his patients often report they would rather receive a negative diagnosis than be left in suspense, even though the uncertainty would still allow hope of a positive outcome. Our inability to tolerate uncertainty carries multiple costs. It can cause us to make premature decisions. It can handicap us in negotiations, leading us to reveal more than we should as we scramble to fill the silence, unable to bear the uncertainty of not knowing what the other person is thinking. And most important, it can lead us to feel anxious. Anxiety is a serious drawback to charisma. First, it impacts our internal state: quite obviously, it’s hard to be fully present while you’re feeling anxious. Anxiety can also lower our confidence. Anxiety, low presence, and low confidence can show up directly in our body language, as well as reduce our ability to emanate warmth. Yet if there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that uncertainty isn’t going away. Considering the ever-increasing pace of business and technological advances as well as unforeseeable economic upheavals, uncertainty and ambiguity will be an increasingly present factor of our daily lives. Those who are better at handling it will gain a distinctive advantage over others. Imagine you’re dealing with a difficult situation whose outcome is uncertain. You envision a variety of ways it could play out, and you strategize how to best deal with each. So far, so good. Once you’ve thought through each scenario, the rational, reasonable, logical thing to do would be to put the situation out of your mind and go about your day until action is actually required. But how many of us have felt our minds going over the different outcomes again and again, rehashing the various plans we’ve made, replaying possible scenarios, mentally rehearsing the upcoming conversations not just once or twice but ad nauseam?*  

- Page 34 (location ~ 518-532)    

*The reason Tom couldn’t let go is that our minds are fundamentally uncomfortable with uncertainty. The minute our brain registers ambiguity, it flashes an error signal. Uncertainty registers as a tension: something that must be corrected before we can feel comfortable again. Our natural discomfort with uncertainty is yet another legacy of our survival instincts. We tend to be more comfortable with what is familiar, which obviously hasn’t killed us yet, than with what is unknown or uncertain, which could turn out to be dangerous. It’s worth learning how to handle uncertainty, not just because it increases charisma but also because the ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business. This is what Adam Berman, the executive director of UC Berkeley’s Business School Center for Innovation, concluded after tracking his MBA students in their career progression.*

*If we could be certain that things will work out—that everything will be taken care of—the uncertainty*

*The single most effective technique I’ve found to alleviate the discomfort of uncertainty is the responsibility transfer.2 In uncertain situations, what we really want to know is that things are somehow going to work out fine. If we could be certain that things will work out—that everything will be taken care of—the uncertainty would produce much less anxiety. Take a moment to try the exercise in the box below. If you’d rather have my voice guide you from start to finish, go to the Charisma Myth Web site: http://www.CharismaMyth.com/transfer. Putting It into Practice: Responsibility Transfer Sit comfortably or lie down, relax, and close your eyes. Take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing clean air toward the top of your head. As you exhale, let that air whoosh through you, washing away all worries and concerns. Pick an entity—God, Fate, the Universe, whatever may best suit your beliefs—that you could imagine as benevolent. Imagine lifting the weight of everything you’re concerned about—this meeting, this interaction, this day—off your shoulders and placing it on the shoulders of whichever entity you’ve chosen. They’re in charge now. Visually lift everything off your shoulders and feel the difference as you are now no longer responsible for the outcome of any of these things. Everything is taken care of. You can sit back, relax, and enjoy whatever good you can find along the way. The next time you feel yourself considering alternative outcomes to a situation, pay close attention. If your brain is going around in circles, obsessing about possible outcomes, try a responsibility transfer to alleviate some of the anxiety. Consider that there might be an all-powerful entity—the Universe, God, Fate—and entrust it with all the worries on your mind.*

*William Bosl, research scientist at the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology Program, explains the implications of a recent functional MRI study on belief, disbelief, and uncertainty as follows:3 “Our brains are wired first to understand, then to believe, and last to disbelieve. Since disbelief requires additional cognitive effort, we get the physiological effects first. And, though this belief may last only a brief moment, it’s enough to produce an emotional and physical reassurance, which can change our thought patterns as well as help alleviate the uncomfortable feelings.”4 Our physiology responds to visuals well before cognitive disbelief kicks in. In addition, visuals short-circuit our cognitive circuits and go straight to our brain’s emotional levels. The responsibility transfer does not actually dispel uncertainty (the outcome remains uncertain). Instead, it makes the uncertainty less uncomfortable. This distinction matters. People will go to great lengths to get rid of the anxiety produced by uncertainty, from making premature decisions to forcing bad outcomes to numbing their anxiety with mind-altering substances of various kinds. However, the responsibility transfer works without trying to negate uncertainty. Instead, it helps you to be less affected by it, drawing you out of the negative mental and physical states that often accompany a position of not knowing. The outcome of your situation may still be uncertain, but you’re no longer so anxious about*

*Imagine that it’s Friday night, and you’re at a large dinner party with people sitting at multiple tables. The conversation at your table is rather dull, in sore contrast to the last party you attended, which was great fun. To make matters worse, the table next to you erupts with laughter. Wouldn’t it be natural to think, I wish I were at that other table. They’re having a much better time… ? Human beings are by nature driven to compare. Whenever we have an experience, we tend to compare it to our past experiences, to others’ experiences, or to our ideal image of what the experience should be. This tendency becomes even more acute when we’re presented with several options and want to make the best possible choice, seeking to optimize the outcome. Each stage of this cycle impairs our charisma. The very act of comparing and evaluating hinders our ability to be fully present. Trying to optimize both impairs our presence and creates anxiety due to the pressure of finding the best possible choice. And a negative evaluation can easily put us in a negative mental state, such as dissatisfaction, envy, or resentment. Because this tendency to compare is wired very deeply in our brains, trying to fight it can take a lot of effort. Instead, notice when you’re making comparisons and use*

*When our internal voice starts criticizing us, lashing out, it can feel like we’re under attack. Because our brain doesn’t distinguish between imagination and reality, these internal attacks are perceived by our mind just as a real, physical attack would be, and they can generate an automatic physical reaction known as the threat response or fight-or-flight response. The effects of this activation are well-known. Just as a zebra reacts to the stress of being chased by a lion, the human body shoots adrenaline and cortisol (stress hormones) through its veins, and directs all its resources toward crucial functions: elevated heart and breathing rates, muscle reaction, vision acuity, and so forth. The body is no longer concerned with living ten more years, but with surviving ten more minutes. It shuts down nonurgent functions such as muscle repair, digestion, and the immune system,6 as well as “superfluous” functions such as cognitive reasoning. In other words, because it’s not critical to survival, intelligent thinking gets shut down.*

*Let’s say you’re in a conversation. You say something, and immediately think, Oh, that was a stupid thing to say. What’s going to happen to your face? You may wince at the thought and your expression may tense. As we’ve discussed, because we can’t control our body language, any negativity in our mind will eventually show up on our face. No matter how brief that negative expression, the person facing you is going to spot it. And all they know is that while you were looking at them and listening to them, a negative expression crossed your face. Naturally they’ll assume that expression was a reaction to them—what they said or did, or what you thought about them. This is how internal negativity affects your body language, and thus your charisma, in addition to your performance. Self-criticism is one of the most common obstacles to great performance in any field. It’s often called the silent killer of business, because so many executives suffer from it, yet so few dare to speak out about it. I’ve heard a variety of people, from junior associates to the most senior executives, privately admit that much of their workday was consumed by negativity, their inner critics constantly pointing out their failings, or predicting disappointing outcomes for their projects and initiatives. In some cases, they (and I) were amazed that they got anything done at all, considering that, as one executive reported, “Eighty percent of my day is spent fighting my inner critic.”*

*Self-doubt, simply put, is lack of confidence in our own ability to achieve something: we doubt our capacity to do it or our capacity to learn how to do it. Worse, it is the fear that there is something essential that we lack, something necessary but unattainable, and that we are just not good enough. In one of the manifestations of self-doubt, known as the impostor syndrome, competent people feel they don’t really know what they’re doing and are just waiting for someone to expose them as a fraud. Since the impostor syndrome was first identified by Georgia State University professors in 1978, we’ve learned that more than 70 percent of the population has experienced this feeling at one time or another.8 Today, we finally have effective tools to handle it (see chapter 4). But already, just knowing the universality of such feelings can help us neutralize their effect and reduce their power. Interestingly, the impostor syndrome is worst among high performers. When I speak about it at Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and MIT, the room goes so silent you could hear a pin drop. And I see the students breathe a sigh of relief as they realize this feeling has a name and they are not alone in experiencing it. Every year, the incoming class at Stanford Business School is asked: “How many of you in here feel that you are the one mistake that the admissions committee made?” Every year, two-thirds of the class immediately raises their hands. When I mention this in speeches, people express astonishment.*

*We’ve seen the effects of anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, and self-doubt. Where does all this negativity come from? The difficult feelings we experience are a natural by-product of one of our most useful survival mechanisms. Negativity exists to spur you to action, to either resolve the problem or get out of the situation. Feelings like fear or anxiety are designed to get you to do something. They’re uncomfortable because they’re “designed” to be uncomfortable. There are times when the discomfort of full-blown fear is highly appropriate. If we were in life-threatening physical danger, then we would surely appreciate our body focusing all of its resources toward ensuring our short-term survival. However, in today’s world, few situations merit a full fight-or-flight response. In these cases, our instinctive reactions actually work against us. Have you ever become paralyzed in the middle of an exam or had the experience of stage fright? Like a deer in headlights, you freeze, your heart races, your palms get sweaty. You’re desperately trying to remember what you’d planned to say or do, but your mind is blank. Your higher cognitive functions have shut down. Sometimes, under the effect of stress, the mind thinks we’re in a fight-or-flight situation, declares a state of emergency, and shuts down what it deems to be superfluous functions. Unfortunately, that means the body is reducing our cognitive abilities just when we need them most. Though it may be hard to remember this in the midst of an anxiety attack, rest assured that this reaction is an entirely normal, natural one that was intended for your well-being. Of course, some degree of self-doubt can be helpful in spurring us to action. For instance, the impostor syndrome can be a great motivating tool, getting us to work harder than anyone else. But at what cost? Considering that this kind of internal negativity impairs our body language, and thus our interactions, not to mention our ability to actually enjoy life, might it not be better to learn how to handle the impostor syndrome and be motivated instead by confidence in our abilities and the joy of accomplishment? Knowing how to handle the impostor syndrome and the inner critic is essential to unleashing your charisma potential. With practice, by using techniques such as the ones you’ll learn in the next chapter, you can achieve some distance from internal negativity, and even get to a place where the inner critic’s voice evokes in you only a smile or a chuckle. I promise.*

*Any internal discomfort—either physical or mental—can impair how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you. Physical tension caused by something as simple as the sun in your eyes produces the same changes in body language as a more serious discomfort, like anxiety or irritation. Prevention is optimal: plan ahead to ensure comfort in clothing, location, and timing. Aim to stay aware of any physical sensation of discomfort. If physical discomfort arises during an interaction, act promptly to alleviate or explain it. Use techniques such as the responsibility transfer to reduce the feelings of anxiety, uncertainty, and dissatisfaction that play out in your body language and inhibit your charisma. Understand that mental negativity such as anxiety, dissatisfaction, self-criticism, or self-doubt is normal and something that everyone experiences.*

*Destigmatizing an experience means reducing its power simply by understanding that it’s normal, common, and nothing to be anxious about or ashamed of. Feeling internal discomfort and negativity is a natural part of life. Everyone experiences it. We all feel the whole spectrum of emotions, no matter how good we are. Even Thich Nhat Hanh, a monk, lifelong practitioner of Buddhism, and the very symbol of enlightened peace in the world, once got so angry at someone, he wanted to stand up and slug him. And yet somehow, in our culture, we’ve gotten into the habit of viewing any physical or mental discomfort as a sign of something gone awry, perhaps even the sign of something wrong within*

*This mindset is one of the main reasons that negative thoughts, emotions, and internal experiences are difficult to handle: we feel they “shouldn’t” be happening. So not only do we feel bad, we then also feel bad about feeling bad. To destigmatize, remind yourself that this internal discomfort, whatever it might be, is a normal part of the human experience and a by-product of one of our brain’s survival mechanisms. It helps to think of others who have experienced what you’re going through, especially if you can think of a person who is like you, but maybe just a step or two ahead—a person you both relate to and admire. If you’ve just lost a key client, for instance, think of someone you know—a mentor you have a high regard for, or a colleague you respect—who suffered a similar setback. Imagine them going through this experience. Of course, hearing them tell you their tale of woe in person would be ideal, but even simply imagining them going through this experience and telling you about it can be very helpful. (Remember, your brain won’t know the difference.)*  

- Page 46 (location ~ 702-710)    

*Another way to destigmatize discomfort is to remind yourself that you’re not alone in this experience. With about 7 billion people on the planet, I can absolutely guarantee you that not just one but scores of people are going through the same thing at this very moment. Rather than seeing it as one big emotion felt by one person, see a community of people struggling with it—one difficult burden shared by many. Rather than being yours alone to bear, see the issue as the depression, the shame, the sadness that is being felt by a multitude of people right now.*  

- Page 47 (location ~ 710-714)    

*You see, shame is the real killer. Of all the emotions that human beings can feel, it is one of the most toxic to health and happiness. Shame researcher Brené Brown defines it as “the fear of being unlovable: Shame is the intensely painful feeling or experience of believing that we are flawed and therefore unworthy of love and belonging.” Shame hits us so powerfully because it conveys a message about our fundamental acceptability as human beings. And in basic survival terms, if the tribe rejects you, you die. It is a life-and-death situation. The brain equates social needs with survival; being hungry and being ostracized activate similar neural responses.1 Somewhere in the back of our minds is the fear of being so disapproved-of that we’d be excluded by those who matter to our survival. Because it’s easily triggered and fast to escalate, shame can quickly grow out of proportion and show up in ways that are not helpful to us. I’ve heard clients express a level of shame for having eaten a candy bar that would have been more appropriate for third-degree murder. Chade-Meng Tan, Google’s Jolly Good Fellow* and a devoted practitioner of mindfulness meditation, believes that the tendency to feel bad about feeling bad is especially true for good people. We start thinking, If I’m a good person, why am I feeling this shame? Surely if I were really good I wouldn’t feel this way. Knowing how to remove the stigma of shame from difficult emotions and experiences is absolutely critical to charisma. Often, it’s not what we feel that is the most painful—it’s our shame about feeling this way that really does the damage. Once we see this feeling as normal and even something to be expected, it becomes much easier to bear. As with any discomfort or difficult feeling, it is helpful to remember that shame is a standard part of the human experience, and that everyone feels it from time to time.*

*The next time an uncomfortable emotion is bothering you, try this step-by-step guide to destigmatizing: Remember that uncomfortable emotions are normal, natural, and simply a legacy of our survival instincts. We all experience them from time to time. Dedramatize: this is a common part of human experience that happens every day. Think of others who’ve gone through this before, especially people you admire. See it as one burden shared by many. You are part of a community of human beings experiencing this one feeling at this very moment.*

*The next time you think you see coldness or reservation in someone’s face while they’re talking to you, try to remember that it could simply be the visible signs of their internal discomfort. You might be catching the surface tremors of an internal tempest, and there’s a good chance that it has nothing to do with how they feel about you or what you’ve just said. This reminder helps me on a regular basis. When I’m involved in a conversation and I catch a tone of annoyance or impatience in someone’s voice, or when I see a fleeting negative expression cross their face, sometimes I still feel instinctively dismayed. It’s hard not to assume that what I’ve just seen is a reaction to what I’ve just said. But right on the heels of this instinctive reaction comes the recognition that whatever I’ve seen may well be the sign of how they’re feeling about themselves, an itchy wool suit, or something else entirely. One of the main reasons we’re so affected by our negative thoughts is that we think our mind has an accurate grasp on reality, and that its conclusions are generally valid. This, however, is a fallacy. Our mind’s view of reality can be, and often is, completely distorted.*  

- Page 49 (location ~ 748-757)    

*our brain filters for relevant information—either what it considers to be important or what we’ve consciously asked it to pay attention to. Through this process, our mind does not provide us with a complete, accurate representation of reality. Because it has to filter, it gives us an incomplete view, presenting only some elements and withholding all others. Most of the time, the elements we’re missing don’t matter, and the picture we get is fairly close to reality. But sometimes our mind will present us with a seriously distorted view of reality. And the distortion often skews negative because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important are usually the most negative ones.*  

- Page 51 (location ~ 767-772)    

*When your brain spins negative scenarios, remind yourself that you may not be getting an accurate perception of reality. Your brain might be following its negativity bias, playing up some elements more than others, or omitting some positives entirely. Just like an optical illusion that tricks your eyes into seeing things that aren’t real, your mind can experience thought illusions that make you feel certain an inaccurate thought is true. Cognitive scientist Steven Hayes suggests that we see negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall. If you’re walking down the street and you see graffiti, you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person. Imagine strolling along the paths of your mind. Suddenly, you notice an unpleasant thought. See it as graffiti on the wall. That’s all it is, graffiti—not a verdict on what kind of person you are.*  

- Page 52 (location ~ 784-790)    

*Don’t assume your thoughts are accurate. Just because your mind comes up with something doesn’t necessarily mean it has any validity. Assume you’re missing a lot of elements, many of which could be positive. <U+2666> See your thoughts as graffiti on a wall or as little electrical impulses flickering around your brain. <U+2666> Assign a label to your negative experience: self-criticism, anger, anxiety, etc. Just naming what you are thinking and feeling can help you neutralize it. <U+2666> Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try “There is shame being felt.” Imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.” <U+2666> Imagine seeing yourself from afar. Zoom out so far, you can see planet Earth hanging in space. Then zoom in to see your continent, then your country, your city, and finally the room you’re in. See your little self, electrical impulses whizzing across your brain. One little being having a particular experience at this particular moment. <U+2666> Imagine your mental chatter as coming from a radio; see if you can turn down the volume, or even just put the radio to the side and let it chatter away. <U+2666> Consider the worst-case outcome for your situation. Realize that whatever it is, you’ll survive. <U+2666> Think of all the previous times when you felt just like this—that you wouldn’t make it through—and yet clearly you did.*

*Steven Hayes and his colleagues studied our tendency to dwell on the forbidden by asking participants in controlled research studies to spend just a few minutes not thinking of a yellow jeep. For many people, the forbidden thought arose immediately, and with increasing frequency. For others, even if they were able to suppress the thought for a short period of time, at some point they broke down and yellow-jeep thoughts rose dramatically. Participants reported thinking about yellow jeeps with some frequency for days and sometimes weeks afterward. Because trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it. You’ve taken the first two steps in handling internal negativity: destigmatizing discomfort and neutralizing negativity. The third and final step will help you not just to lessen internal negativity but to actually replace it with a different internal reality.*

*Once the fight-or-flight response is aroused, it’s hard to quiet down. Anger is a difficult emotion to flush out of your system—this is why an unpleasant traffic encounter in the morning can stay on your mind for hours and sometimes all day. If you aimed to simply suppress the anger, you would pay a high price. When people are induced into a negative emotional state and then asked to suppress negative emotions, their internal negative experience often remains unchanged and they sustain elevated stress responses in their brain and cardiovascular system.3 But what if you happened to learn that this apparently reckless driver was actually a distraught mother whose baby was choking in the backseat, and she was desperately trying to pull over into the breakdown lane while reaching back to save her baby’s life? Would that immediately reduce your anger? For most people, it would. Deciding to change your belief about what happened (technically called cognitive reappraisal) effectively decreases the brain’s stress levels. This came to light through research performed at Stanford using functional MRI machines. The researchers concluded that deciding to change beliefs was a far more effective and healthier solution than attempting to repress or ignore emotions.*

*It was four in the morning and I couldn’t sleep. My mind was filled with apprehension. In a few hours I would be addressing the three hundred senior executives of a large multinational corporation. The CEO, who had asked me to address his top management, expected his people to come out of my session with both a mindset shift and a practical toolkit. I had ninety minutes to make them more confident, influential, persuasive, and inspiring. And all this, in Spanish. The pressure was high. I had already tossed and turned for hours, paced around the soulless hotel room, and stared out the window at the blinking city lights, desperately trying to find sleep. I felt nauseated, exhausted, and emotionally spent. My mind was churning, and I dreaded the hours of insomnia I felt were ahead of me. Suddenly, the rewriting reality exercise floated through my mind. Though it seemed far-fetched, I realized that at this point I’d tried everything else, and had nothing to lose by giving the technique a try. I sat down at the desk, pulled out pen and paper and asked myself: What if this unfortunate, unpleasant experience is absolutely perfect just as it is—the insomnia, the nausea, the fact that this is happening the very night before a high-profile assignment? In what way can this turn out to be absolutely perfect for me? It took a few minutes, but eventually answers began to arise. And I wrote: “Maybe I’ll somehow do well tomorrow and come to know that even sleep-deprived, and in a foreign language, I can still do all right. Maybe this knowledge will be key someday when I’m faced with an even more important assignment. And I’ll be grateful for having had the uncomfortable experience I’m living through now.” At first, these statements felt like sheer delusion. But writing them down (you’ll learn why this is important) opened up a little window of possibility in my mind. I continued to write all the possible upsides of this unfortunate experience.*  

- Page 56 (location ~ 850-864)    

*I’ve often used the rewriting reality technique to get into a better-performing mental state, and I now give it to all my coaching clients. Not only does it work for them, but I’ve met many other highly successful people over the years who’ve told me they use similar techniques. One charismatic entrepreneur told me: “I decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself. It’s not just that I’m optimistic, I’m actually conveniently deluded.” Why does this work? Once again, we can thank the brain’s tendency to accept imagination as reality. A study conducted by the Harvard Medical School suggests that deception may not be necessary for the placebo effect to take hold; it may work its wonders even when people know full well that they’re taking a placebo.5 So when a difficult experience arises and risks impairing your charisma levels, rather than trying to suppress or ignore your internal difficulties, consider a few alternate versions of reality. Conjure a few different scenarios that would induce you into a more useful mental state.*

*One author friend reminded me of a maxim called Parkinson’s Law: “Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” He challenged me: “Rather than letting the writing process fill the entire year, try to write the entire book in one month. At the end of a month, what you have will certainly not be a finished book, but it’ll be more than you would have without this self-imposed deadline.”*

*Let’s imagine that traffic is making you late for an important meeting and your anxiety level is on the rise. Ask yourself: What if this delay is a good thing? Repeat the question a few times, and watch how creative your mind can get with its answers. It might come up with explanations like these: <U+2666> This delay is going to save my life—had traffic been flowing normally, my path would have crossed that of an eighteen-wheel truck skidding across the intersection. <U+2666> The people with whom I’m due to meet are under a drastic deadline and are grateful for every minute I’m late, which allows them to work just a little bit longer. <U+2666> The Universe (or Fate or God), having my best interests at heart, does not want this meeting to happen. There’s an even better direction things will take instead. When you’re dealing with a more serious situation, sit down and write out a new reality on a piece of paper. Writing accesses different parts of our brain6 and affects our beliefs in ways that other modes of expression do not. The act of committing things to writing has been shown to be critical both in changing a person’s mind7 and in making imagined stories feel more real.8 Write in the present tense: “The speech is going well…” Or, even better, in the past tense: “The speech was a complete triumph…”*

*Putting It into Practice: Getting Satisfaction <U+2666> Think of one person in your life who has aggrieved you. <U+2666> Take a blank page and write that person a letter saying anything and everything you wish you had ever told them. Really get into this—you have nothing to lose. Make sure you write it out by hand. <U+2666> When you’ve gotten absolutely everything off your mind and onto paper, put the letter aside. <U+2666> Take a fresh sheet and write their response just the way you wish they would respond. You might have them taking responsibility for their actions, acknowledging and apologizing for everything they’ve ever done that hurt you. You don’t need to find any justification for their actions, just an acknowledgment and an apology. It’s your imagination, so you get to decide exactly what you’d like to hear. This exercise may feel alien, awkward, or unreal at first—that’s the case for many people. And you may not feel an immediate internal shift. However, over the next few days you may be amazed to feel this “new reality” gradually taking hold. You may feel that you did get the closure you needed. To accelerate the process, simply reread the apology letter nightly for a few days. You’ll appreciate the results.*

See them purely as physical sensations, like hot and cold. <U+2666> When you feel the urge to laugh, talk, or relieve the discomfort in any way, resist it. This is your chance to practice delving into the sensations, not avoiding them.*

*The ability to handle discomfort is a highly valuable skill. The less discomfort affects you, the fewer the situations that can impair your charisma potential. When you know how to handle discomfort, no situation can shake you; whether business or personal, there is no feeling that can make you run away. One CEO told me that “the most effective thing you can do for your career is to get comfortable being uncomfortable.” Think of the plethora of discomforts that come with leadership, from having to fire employees to taking the heat for a team failure, or simply enduring painful meetings. Think of how critical it can be to handle the discomfort of silence during negotiations. I’ve often heard professional negotiators tell me that they could accurately predict the outcome of negotiations fairly early on using one simple clue: whoever has less endurance for silence loses.*

*Putting It into Practice: Stretching Your Comfort Zone Here are more techniques to help you broaden your comfort zone and build comfort with discomfort. Since most of these involve some degree of awkwardness, it’s best to use them in low-stakes encounters rather than with key clients or with your boss. <U+2666> Hold eye contact longer than is comfortable. One of my students started practicing this on passengers in passing cars while waiting at a bus stop. He said the reactions he’d get were amazing, from smiles and waves to honks and shouts. <U+2666> Experiment with personal space. Move closer to people than you usually would in an elevator, for instance. Notice how strong the urge is to revert to your standard behavior. Try not to give in. <U+2666> Hold the elevator door open for everyone entering, and then get in last. Stand with your back to the elevator door, facing everyone else. <U+2666> Strike up a conversation with a complete stranger. For instance, as you wait in line at a coffee shop, comment on the pastries and then ask your neighbor an open-ended question, such as: “I’m trying to decide which is the most sinful: the muffin, the brownie, or the cake. How would you rank them?”*

*To be charismatic, you must first learn to overcome the primary obstacle to charisma: internal discomfort. Skillfully handle internal discomfort with a three-step process: destigmatize your discomfort, neutralize your negative thoughts, and rewrite your perception of reality. Destigmatize and dedramatize uncomfortable feelings by remembering that they are survival instincts and a natural part of the human experience. Think of others who’ve gone through this before—especially people you admire—and see yourself as part of a community of human beings experiencing the same feeling at the same moment. Neutralize unhelpful negative thoughts by remembering that the mind often distorts reality and filters your environment to highlight the negative. Think of your negative thoughts as graffiti on a wall—you may find it an ugly sight, but just because you see an ugly sight doesn’t mean you’re an ugly person. Rewrite reality by considering a few helpful alternatives to your current perspective. For maximum effect, write down your new realities by hand and describe them in vivid detail. For advanced practice, delve into the physical sensations of discomfort. Focusing on the sensations gives your mind something concrete to focus on, drawing your attention away from your feeling that the experience is unbearable.*

*“There is good evidence that imagining oneself performing an activity activates parts of the brain that are used in actually performing the activity,” Professor Stephen Kosslyn, director of Stanford’s Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, wrote me. This is the reason why visualization works so well—in fact, some athletes report feeling physically exhausted after intense visualization sessions. Visualization can even physically alter the brain structure: repeated experiments have shown that simply imagining yourself playing the piano with sufficient repetition leads to a detectable and measurable change in the motor cortex of the brain.*

*Method acting evolved to help actors with their most difficult task: getting their body language right. Consciously trying to control as much of their body language as possible was both exhausting and doomed to fail: even with years of training, it’s impossible to control the flow completely. If their internal emotions were not what they wanted the outside world to see, sooner or later, something of these underlying thoughts and feelings would show. Method acting took a different approach. Rather than having people try to control their body language, it went straight to the body language source—the mind—and had the actors strive to become the characters they were aiming to play so that they would really feel the emotions they wanted to convey. Then the thousands of body language signals would flow naturally and congruently. Because of its powerful mental and physiological effects, visualization is one of the most effective charisma-boosting tools available. The right visualization can help you increase your internal feeling of confidence as well as your ability to project it. Just by using the right mental images, your subconscious mind will send a remarkable chain reaction of confidence signals cascading through your body. In fact, you can display nearly any body language just by picking the right visualization.*

*The following visualization is a great tool to increase the amount of power you want to convey. You can try this exercise at home on the couch, at work sitting at your desk, or even in an elevator—whenever you have an opportunity to close your eyes for a minute. <U+2666> Close your eyes and relax. <U+2666> Remember a past experience when you felt absolutely triumphant—for example, the day you won a contest or an award. <U+2666> Hear the sounds in the room: the murmurs of approval, the swell of applause. <U+2666> See people’s smiles and expressions of warmth and admiration. <U+2666> Feel your feet on the ground and the congratulatory handshakes. <U+2666> Above all, experience your feelings, the warm glow of confidence rising within you. Do you feel more confident? Some people experience very strong results from their first visualization and others less. But, as with any other skill, your ability to create realistic visualizations will improve with practice.*

*Some people find it simple to think through a visualization scenario. However, others are more sensitive to auditory cues, so here’s an alternative to visualization: select key phrases to mentally focus on. My clients have found a wide variety of phrases useful, so here are a few examples, which could help you access calm and serenity. They run the gamut of tastes and styles, so you may find that some raise your hackles while others strongly resonate: A week from now, or a year from now, will any of this matter? This, too, shall pass. Yes, it will. Look for little miracles unfolding right now. Love the confusion. What if you could trust the Universe, even with this? Axioms like these can be a saving grace in moments of panic, when our brain goes blank and all we can remember are simple phrases. Beginning white-water rafters are taught an easy rhyme to remember—“toes to nose”—to remind them of the sequence of moves they should execute if the boat flips over.*  

- Page 72 (location ~ 1101-1109)    

*If you’re ready to go all out, add movement to make your visualizations reach an entirely new level. Because physiology affects psychology (yes, your body affects your mind—more on this in the next chapter), creating certain movements or postures can bring up specific emotions in your mind. Try to think of what gesture you tend to make when you achieve something, like a good golf shot, or when you get really good news. Is it the classic fist pump? Or maybe you raise both arms in the air and shout “YES!” By adding this particular gesture (and words, if any) to the end of your visualization, when your confidence is soaring, you’ll engage your entire physiology and “lock in” the triumphant feeling, maximizing the effect of the exercise.*  

- Page 73 (location ~ 1115-1120)    

*Just before giving a presentation: Some of this century’s best-known speakers report using some version of visualization just before stepping into the spotlight. In fact, it would be unusual to find a great speaker who doesn’t. When clients ask me if they should use visualization before an important speech, I answer, “Only if you want it to go really well!”*  

- Page 74 (location ~ 1129-1131)    

*To make the visualization most effective, I try to arrive at the venue early so that I can walk around the stage and get comfortable with the space. I take the right music along with me and start the visualizations right there on stage, aiming to link confident, triumphant feelings to being in that particular environment. While listening to an uplifting, energizing soundtrack, I create mental movies, vividly imagining how splendidly the speech is going, seeing and hearing the audience’s enthusiastic response as I confidently move across the stage. A few minutes before I’m due to walk out under the spotlights, I hide away in an unoccupied room (this is such a common practice for actors, politicians, speakers, and all other performers that a special room called the green room is often reserved for just this purpose) and run through my visualization, dancing around (yes, I’m serious) to my personal soundtrack.*

*Silvia recently confided that visualization is one of the secrets to her success. Before key meetings, she’ll imagine “the smiles on their faces because they liked me and they are confident about the value I’m bringing them. I’ll imagine as much detail as I can, even seeing the wrinkles around their eyes as they’re smiling.” She visualizes the whole interaction, all the way through to the firm handshakes that close the meeting, sealing the deal.*

I’ve even found visualization helpful before writing important e-mails. Just as the right visualization helps you get into the right body language so that the right signals flow effortlessly, you can use visualization to get into specific emotional or mental states so that the right words flow as well.*

*Anytime you’re feeling anxious: The surest way to feel better when you’re feeling anxious is to flood your system with oxytocin. Often called the neuropeptide of trust, oxytocin instantly reverses the arousal of the fight-or-flight response. One of my favorite neuroscience resources, the Wise Brain Bulletin, suggested that a twenty-second hug is enough to send oxytocin coursing through your veins, and that you can achieve the same effect just by imagining the hug. So the next time you’re feeling anxious, you might want to imagine being wrapped up in a great big hug from someone you care about. Time and time again, my clients are astounded by how effective these techniques are. “Visualization techniques have saved lives at MIT,” one recent graduate told me. This famously high-achieving institution is also known for high rates of suicide, especially during final exams (MIT’s suicide rate during the period was 38 percent higher than Harvard’s, for instance3). The MIT Health Center now distributes visualization CDs to students during final exams.*

*Nineteenth-century author Napoleon Hill would regularly visualize nine famous men as his personal counselors, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas Edison, Charles Darwin, and Abraham Lincoln. He wrote: “Every night… I held an imaginary council meeting with this group whom I called my ‘Invisible Counselors.’… I now go to my imaginary counselors with every difficult problem that confronts me and my clients. The results are often astonishing.” Choose your own counselors according to which emotions they embody for you. Hill’s chosen self-confidence counselor was Napoleon Bonaparte. To boost your charisma, choose figures who represent complete self-confidence, or warmth and caring, or calm and serenity. Or you might even find some figures who embody all the elements at once. Visualize yourself going to these figures for a “pep talk” anytime you feel you need one. Thanks to the brain’s wonderful placebo response, this will produce effects even if it doesn’t feel real.*

*The first step is to get in touch with warmth directed toward life in general, and your life in particular. This falls under the general category of gratitude. Gratitude has a special advantage for those of us who sometimes find it uncomfortable to connect with others. It can give us charismatic warmth without having to connect with anyone. Then you’ll experiment with warmth toward others—these are the realms of goodwill, altruism, compassion, and empathy.*  

- Page 77 (location ~ 1180-1183)    

*Everyone seems to be preaching gratitude these days. Oprah champions an “attitude of gratitude,” and studies have come out showing that gratitude helps you live longer, healthier, and even happier.4 The science is compelling, as are the ways in which gratitude can boost your charisma. If you can access gratitude, an instant change will sweep through your body language from head to toe: your face will soften, your whole body will relax. Your body language will emanate both warmth and a particular grounded confidence that people will find very appealing. But few of us can simply decide to get into a state of gratitude. In fact, for most people, gratitude doesn’t come easy. Human beings are instinctively wired for hedonic adaptation: the tendency to take our blessings for granted.5 Telling yourself that you should be grateful is often counterproductive, as it only brings up guilt. Clients complain that when someone tells them “You should be grateful,” it only makes them feel worse: either resentful or guilty for not being grateful.*  

- Page 78 (location ~ 1191-1200)    

*One way to invoke a sense of gratitude is to focus on little things that are physically present. During a recent lunch meeting at a restaurant, for instance, I focused on little delights: the sun streaming through the window; blue skies; that the waiter got my order right; or the existence, availability, and wonders of ketchup. Another good gratitude-enhancing tool is to view your life through a third-person lens, writing a narrative about yourself cast in a positive light.*  

- Page 79 (location ~ 1200-1204)    

*Putting It into Practice: Gratitude Focus on the present: The next time you find yourself annoyed at some minor thing, remember that letting your mind focus on the annoyance could impair your body language. To counter this, follow the suggestions below: <U+2666> Sweep through your body from head to toe and find three abilities you approve of. You could be grateful that you have feet and toes that allow you to walk. You might appreciate your ability to read. Try it right now: <U+2666> Scan your environment. Look around and find three pleasant sights—even the smallest ones. Maybe you can see the sky and appreciate its shades of color. Perhaps you can notice the texture of the table you’re sitting at or even the paper right in front of you. Try it right now: Use a third-person lens: For this technique, you’ll need just a few minutes to sit down, a pen, and some paper. <U+2666> Start to describe your life as if you were an outside observer, and focus on all the positive aspects you can think of. <U+2666> Write about your job—the work you do and the people you work with. Describe your personal relationships and the good things friends and family members would say about you. Mention a few positive things that have happened today and the tasks you have already accomplished. <U+2666> Take the time to write down this narrative. Just thinking about it won’t be as effective. Imagine your own funeral: The last gratitude-enhancing technique, used in many highly regarded leadership seminars despite its outlandishness, is the most intense—do not take it lightly.*

*Have you ever felt flooded with relief after finding an important item you thought had been lost or stolen? (It happens to me every time I lose my keys.) This instinctive sweeping sense of gratitude can be remarkably powerful, and it taps into wells of gratitude deeper than almost any other practice. You can manufacture this gratitude-producing sense of relief by imagining your own funeral. Within seconds, this visualization can bring you into a state of emotional aliveness and, as you realize you still have your life, to a state of gratitude. The main point of this exercise is to help you gain access to various shades of warmth and give you a chance to get comfortable with these feelings. This is one of the few exercises that can fairly effectively help you feel gratitude for life. It can be very moving, bring you great insights, and give you clarity on deeply held values, but it can also make you feel quite stirred up. So for this one, please ensure that you’re in an environment where you would feel comfortable being emotional. I often recommend doing this at home.*  

- Page 81 (location ~ 1228-1237)    

*Sit or lie down, close your eyes, and set the scene. Where is your funeral being held? What day of the week, what time of day? What is the weather like? See the building where the ceremony is being held. See people arriving. Who’s coming? What are they wearing? Now move into the building and look around inside. Do you see flowers? If so, smell the flowers’ scent heavy on the air. See people coming through the door. What are they thinking? What kind of chairs are they sitting in? What do these chairs feel like? <U+2666> Your funeral starts. Think of the people you care most about or whose opinions matter most to you. What are they thinking? See them stepping up one after another and delivering their eulogy. What are they saying? What regrets do they have for you? Now think: What would you like them to have said? What regrets do you have for yourself? <U+2666> See people following your coffin to the cemetery and gathering around your grave. What would you like to see written on your tombstone? <U+2666> Almost everyone, of all ages, genders, and seniority levels, gets a bit teary-eyed by the end. You might feel moved, touched, stirred. Stay with these emotions as much as you can and aim to get comfortable with them.*

*Goodwill improves how you feel as it floods your system with oxytocin and serotonin, both wonderful feel-good chemicals. In addition, in an interesting way, it lessens our need to make the interaction succeed. When our only aim is to broadcast goodwill, it takes the pressure off. We’re no longer striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction. And since we’re less concerned about how the interaction goes, we can both feel and project more charismatic confidence. Goodwill is the simple state of wishing others well. You can think of it as a mental muscle that can be strengthened through practice. Even if your goodwill muscles have atrophied, you can still build them back up. A recent study from the Wiseman Institute using functional MRI scans showed that these positive states could be learned, just like playing a musical instrument or being proficient at a sport. The scans revealed that the corresponding brain circuits were “dramatically changed” through training.*

*Below are more intense goodwill exercises to experiment with. For some people, they work instantly. For others, they feel alien. Just try them out—if these don’t work for you, we’ll have others for you to experiment with. First, a visualization. This one comes from neuroscientist Dr. Privahini Bradoo, a highly charismatic person whose radiating warmth and happiness I’ve long admired. I was grateful when she shared one of her secrets with me: in any interaction, imagine the person you’re speaking to, and all those around you, as having invisible angel wings. This can help shift your perspective. If even for a split second you can see someone as a fundamentally good being, this will soften and warm your emotional reaction toward them, changing your entire body language. So give it a try: as you’re walking around, or driving around, see people with angel wings walking and driving. It’s worth imagining yourself with wings, too. Imagine that you’re all a team of angels working together, all doing your wholehearted best. Many of my coaching clients (even hardened senior executives) have told me how extraordinarily effective this visualization has been for them. They can instantly feel more internal presence and warmth, and I can see a great increase in the amount of both presence and warmth that their body language projects.*  

- Page 83 (location ~ 1271-1280)    

*Paul Gilbert, one of the main researchers in the field of compassion, describes the process of accessing compassion as follows: first comes empathy, the ability to understand what someone is feeling, to detect distress; second, sympathy, being emotionally moved by distress; and third, compassion, which arises with the desire to care for the well-being of the distressed person.*  

- Page 85 (location ~ 1291-1294)    

*Putting It into Practice: Compassion Goodwill and compassion give you warmth to balance your power, and can save you from appearing overconfident or, worse, arrogant. They can also be a stealth tool, a silver bullet that turns around difficult conversations. Take the three steps below to practice compassion for someone you know: Imagine their past. What if you had been born in their circumstances, with their family and upbringing? What was it like growing up in their family situation with whatever they experienced as a child? It’s often said that everyone you meet has stories to tell, and that everyone has a few that would break your heart. Consider also that if you had experienced everything they have experienced, perhaps you would have turned out just like they have. Imagine their present. Really try to put yourself in their shoes right now. Imagine what it feels like to be them today. Put yourself in their place, be in their skin, see through their eyes. Imagine what they might be feeling right now—all the emotions they might be holding inside. If you really need compassion dynamite, look at them and ask: What if this were their last day alive? You can even imagine their funeral. You’re at their funeral, and you’re asked to say a few words about them. You can also imagine what you’d say to them after they’d already died.*

*Step Three: Self-Compassion Helen was clearly very bright. She could make forceful and persuasive arguments, and she came across as organized, trustworthy, and a good listener, intensely focused on what people were saying. But she wasn’t charismatic, and she realized it. “I know I’m interesting,” she told me. “I’m a good listener, and a good conversationalist. But I don’t think I’m likable, and I’m definitely not charismatic.” Helen had plenty of self-confidence. So what was she lacking? Warmth. People were impressed by how much she knew, but they didn’t feel cared for. Helen couldn’t emanate warmth because she had a hard time feeling it—whether for others or for herself. Instead, she usually felt a little alienated, disconnected. In our first meeting together, she very sincerely wondered aloud, “Why would people like me? Even I don’t find myself likable.” As you can imagine, this cold internal message resonated in her head, played across her body language, and diminished how much warmth she could emanate. For Helen, the path to charisma was through self-warmth. Warmth as we’ve described it so far is directed outward—toward other people, or toward life in general. But warmth can also be directed inward, toward ourselves. This self-directed warmth is called self-compassion, and though it can sound (and feel) uncomfortable, it can be a life-changing (and certainly charisma-enhancing) practice. First, let’s distinguish three key concepts: Self-confidence is our belief in our ability to do or to learn how to do something. Self-esteem is how much we approve of or value ourselves. It’s often a comparison-based evaluation (whether measured against other people or against our own internal standards for approval). Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience.*  

- Page 86 (location ~ 1317-1332)    

*Recent behavioral science research indicates that it may be healthier to focus on self-compassion than on self-esteem.6 The former is based on self-acceptance, the latter on self-evaluation and social comparison. Self-esteem is more of a roller coaster, contingent on how we believe we compare to others. It also tends to correlate with narcissism. Individuals who score high on self-compassion scales demonstrate greater emotional resilience to daily difficulties and fewer negative reactions to difficult situations, such as receiving unflattering feedback.7 Higher self-compassion predicts a greater sense of personal responsibility for the outcome of events: it helps predict levels of accountability. People who score high on self-compassion also have a lower tendency for denial. This makes sense: personal mistakes would generate less self-criticism, so people would be more willing to admit to them. When they hear the term self-compassion, people often assume it is synonymous with self-indulgence or self-pity.*  

- Page 87 (location ~ 1334-1343)    

*You can think of the difference between the two this way: self-compassion is feeling that what happened to you is unfortunate, whereas self-pity is feeling that what happened to you is unfair. In this way, self-pity can lead to resentment or bitterness, and to feeling more isolated and alienated. In contrast, self-compassion often leads to increased feelings of connectedness.*  

- Page 88 (location ~ 1345-1347)    

*Self-compassion delivers an impressive array of benefits: decreased anxiety, depression, and self-criticism; improved relationships and greater feelings of social connectedness and satisfaction with life; increased ability to handle negative events; and even improved immune system functioning.9 Sounds great, doesn’t it? Unfortunately, self-compassion isn’t taught in school. In fact, in today’s culture it sounds indulgent and unjustified, and can feel very alien. Many of us don’t have a very clear idea of what it is to begin with. So first, let’s get a solid definition. Kristin Neff, one of compassion’s foremost researchers, defines self-compassion as a three-step process: First, realizing that we’re experiencing difficulties. Second, responding with kindness and understanding toward ourselves when we are suffering or feel inadequate, rather than being harshly self-critical. Third, realizing that whatever we’re going through is commonly experienced by all human beings, and remembering that everyone goes through difficult times.*  

- Page 89 (location ~ 1356-1364)    

*How does one go about cultivating self-compassion? The good news is that intention is the most crucial component of treating yourself kindly. Christopher Germer, author of The Mindful Path to Self-Compassion, is adamant that “self-compassion is not a gift you’re either born with or not. It’s a skill, a trainable mental skill that each and every one of us, without exception, can develop and strengthen.” Germer suggests starting where you are right now: discovering the ways in which you already care for yourself, and then reminding yourself to do these things when negativity hits.*

*The highly charismatic Dalai Lama is known for being such a radiant presence of warmth and caring that even the most cold-hearted characters melt in his presence. He ascribes much of his effect on people to Buddhist compassion practices, one of which you’re about to learn, called Metta. Metta is a millennia-old Buddhist compassion and self-compassion practice that roughly translates as “loving kindness.” Simply put, Metta is the conscious practice of developing kind intentions toward all beings. When the brains of dedicated Metta practitioners were examined and tested by neuroscientists, significant differences came to light. Not only did they emit deeper brain waves, they also bounced back from stress scenarios much faster, and they showed particular enhancement in the left frontal lobe of their cortexes, the “happy region” of the brain.10 Metta is the single most powerful tool you can use to counter your inner critic’s attacks, and, with its many benefits, it is wonderful for boosting charisma. This is, however, a highly uncomfortable practice for many of us. Frankly, when I started this practice, it was more than uncomfortable—it was downright awkward. Even if it feels this way for you, too, do it anyway.*

*Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing in masses of clean air toward the top of your head; then let it whoosh through you from head to toe as you exhale, washing all concerns away. <U+2666> Think of any occasion in your life when you performed a good deed, however great or small. Just one good action—one moment of truth, generosity, or courage. Focus on that memory for a moment. <U+2666> Now think of one being, whether present or past, mythical or actual—Jesus, Buddha, Mother Teresa, the Dalai Lama—who could have great affection for you. This could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal.*

Feel their warmth radiating toward you, enveloping you. <U+2666> See yourself through their eyes with warmth, kindness, and compassion. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic says is wrong. You are completely and absolutely forgiven. You have a clean slate. <U+2666> Feel them giving you wholehearted acceptance. You are accepted as you are, right now, at this stage of growth, imperfections and all. You are perfect. At this stage of development, you are perfect. At this stage of growth, you are perfect. At this stage of perfection, you are perfect. With everything that’s in your head and heart, you are perfect. <U+2666> With all your imperfections, you are perfect. <U+2666> For this phase of growth, you are perfect. <U+2666> You are fully approved just the way you are, at this stage of development, right now.*

*If the Metta visualization didn’t work for you, try putting up, throughout your home or office, photographs of people for whom you feel affection. These pictures could be of friends or family members, or even public figures who you feel could have affection for you, such as the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, or whichever figures resonate with your personal beliefs or bring warmth to your heart (pets and stuffed animals included). To nurture my internal warmth I set up a “Metta circle” of photographs in the area where I practice every morning. I also carry a small book of favorite wisdoms with me when I want to ensure that I’ll be in the right charismatic mental state. The heart-softening and rising warmth I feel every time I glance through it is invaluable. It boosts my charisma within minutes, moving me from a state of worry or irritation to one of calm, confidence, and warmth.*

*Harvard and Columbia psychology researchers found that subjects who assumed a strong, confident physical posture and then spoke with a strong voice and imposing hand gestures actually produced a biochemical reaction that made them feel and seem more confident and powerful. In contrast, those who adopted a hesitant, submissive demeanor experienced the exact opposite biochemical reaction.12 Displaying confident body language will actually make you feel more confident; these feelings will in turn affect your body language, which will adapt accordingly, displaying yet more confident signals. This will give you yet another feeling boost, and the cycle will build upon itself. All you have to do is get it going.*

*Putting It into Practice: Using Your Body to Change Your Mind Try out the following postures to see for yourself just how powerfully the arrangement of your body can affect your mind and your feelings. <U+2666> First, adopt the body language of someone who’s utterly depressed. Let your shoulders slump, your head hang, your face sag. Now, without moving a muscle, try to feel really, truly excited. Go ahead, try to see if you can create any excitement without moving. It’s nearly impossible. <U+2666> Now do the opposite. Physically spring into excitement. Jump up and down as if you’ve won the lottery, smile the biggest smile you can, wave your arms in the air, and while doing all this, try to feel depressed. Again, it’s nearly impossible. Here are a few more physiological changes to play with: <U+2666> For confidence, assertiveness, and to be able to emanate gravitas, imagine playing the role of a military general—take a wide stance, puff up your chest, broaden your shoulders, stand straight, and confidently put your arms behind your back. Feel the effect of this posture internally. <U+2666> For a boost in both energy and warmth, stand up, stretch your hands as high up as possible, inhale as much as you can—imagine your rib cage expanding, doubling in size—make the biggest smile you can and look upward, hold for a second, and then relax everything. You can use these quick tools in pretty much any situation—anytime you’d like an internal-state change, whether just before an important business meeting or a social gathering.*

*Plan a warm-up period that allows you to gradually ramp up to the level you want. When you want to ensure peak charismatic performance, don’t expect yourself to be on top of your game, going from zero to full charisma instantly and at will. You can’t rely on pure willpower to get you there. In fact, it’s important to understand just how limited our daily reserves of willpower really are.13 Behavioral science researchers have come to the conclusion that willpower is a bit like a muscle that fatigues depending on how much we use it. If we draw on our willpower to resist a temptation or to put up with a certain annoyance, it will be weaker when we need it for another activity soon after. In fact, exerting willpower physically fatigues us.14 It is a finite resource, so be strategic about where and when you expend*

*Let’s say you’re attending a dinner that could significantly affect your career, so you’d like to be particularly charismatic. To optimize your chances of being most charismatic, you know you need to get into a mental state of warmth and power. If, at dinner, you want to broadcast absolute self-confidence, make sure that the day of and especially the hours leading up to the dinner do not include meetings or interactions that could make you feel bad about yourself. Rather than just showing up at dinner, plan a warm-up that will boost your self-esteem: have coffee with someone who makes you feel good about yourself, or plan an activity (play a sport or a musical instrument) that makes you feel competent or accomplished. If there is a cocktail reception before the dinner, interact with people who make you feel good about yourself, not those who criticize or tease you, even in jest. Yes, making fun of one another can be highly enjoyable—but save that for evenings when charisma is less critical.*

*You know how listening to sad songs can make you feel sad? Be aware that everything that enters your mind affects your internal state. I curate my playlists considering both tempo and lyrics, and when preparing for a key moment, I’m careful to choose songs that correspond with the mood I’m trying to achieve. I have playlists for self-confidence, warmth, empathy, and patience. I’ve found that it really makes a difference. These playlists are also organized as “pre-speech,” “morning wake-up,” and even “pre–family gatherings” (yes, I’m serious).*

*Putting It into Practice: Warming Up When warming up for an important event, follow this checklist to prepare your internal state and maximize your charisma. <U+2666> Go over your schedule for the hours leading up to the event. Think about how the activities and meetings you have planned will affect you. <U+2666> If you can, avoid any difficult encounters and aim for confidence- or warmth-boosting experiences instead. <U+2666> Create your own music playlist for the internal state you’d like to have. You could make one for energy and confidence, one that makes you feel warm and empathetic, and another that makes you feel calm and serene. This exercise is a lot of fun in itself, and you can add new songs as often as you’d like.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Creating an optimal mental state is crucial to unleashing your full charisma potential. Visualization can help you create the right mental state and thus the right charismatic body language. To make visualizations most effective, vividly engage all five senses in your imagination. You can increase both warmth and confidence by practicing gratitude, goodwill, and compassion for others as well as for yourself. Just as professional athletes and performers do, plan a gradual warm-up to reach your peak charismatic performance. Before important events, avoid experiences that would impair your mental state and plan warmth- and confidence-boosting activities instead. Your body affects your mind. Flip the visualization technique on its head and practice adopting the right posture and facial expressions to access more of almost any desired internal state.*  

- Page 100 (location ~ 1529-1538)    

*Focus charisma is primarily based on a perception of presence. It gives people the feeling that you are fully present with them, listening to them and absorbing what they say. Focus charisma makes people feel heard, listened to, and understood. Don’t underestimate this kind of charisma; it can be surprisingly powerful.*  

- Page 102 (location ~ 1551-1553)    

*Jack Keeler, former president of IBM, was known as a very charismatic figure who embodied another key component of focus charisma: the ability to communicate respect. Remember that one of the foundations of charisma is making other people feel good about themselves. Keeler knew how to make others feel that their opinions mattered, and that they were important. He truly believed that even the most junior staff could have pearls of wisdom to impart. One executive who worked with him told me: “You’d see him go to plant manufacturers and engineers, and you could see that he held them in such high regard; he revered them. And in turn, they revered him—they’d light up when he’d walk into the room.” What people notice: We assess focus charisma entirely through demeanor. Presence is key: because we can perceive any distracted, inattentive body language, such signals would quickly undermine focus charisma.*  

- Page 102 (location ~ 1558-1564)    

*Focus charisma requires, of course, the ability to focus and be truly present. Good listening skills are nonnegotiable, as is a certain degree of patience. To develop focus charisma, cultivate your ability to be present: make use of the techniques from the “Presence” section in chapter 2 (get into your toes!). You’ll also need the skills to handle charisma-impairing internal discomfort, so tools such as the responsibility transfer and delving into sensations are worth acquiring. Once you have it: Focus charisma is perhaps the easiest form of charisma to access, and can be surprisingly effective, but it comes with two main risks. The first is that if you display too little power you could come across as too eager, and consequently low-status or even subservient. You’ll learn in chapter 9 how to increase the amount of confidence you broadcast. A less common risk is exhibiting too little warmth, which leads to attention that is too intense. If you become laser-focused, your interaction may start to feel like an interview, or, worse yet, an interrogation. This is where you need to balance focus with warmth and acceptance or genuine respect, and the following two chapters will show you just how to do that. Though it is primarily based on presence, focus charisma still requires a modicum of both confidence and warmth. You can’t discard either dimension entirely. When to use it: Focus charisma is appropriate for almost all business situations. It’s particularly useful when you need people to open up and share information. In fact, this is a great charisma style for management consultants or those in other professional services, such as lawyers, accountants, and financial advisers. Focus charisma can also be very helpful in difficult situations, such as negotiations or to defuse hostile conversations.*  

- Page 103 (location ~ 1565-1579)    

*Why is visionary charisma so effective and powerful? Because of our natural discomfort with uncertainty. In a constantly changing world, we crave something solid to cling to. During George W. Bush’s first presidential campaign, polls of his supporters revealed that a key to their attraction to him was “his conviction and certitude in his beliefs.” Conveying visionary charisma requires the ability to project complete conviction and confidence in a cause. In this way, visionary charisma is based on power. However, it is also based on warmth. Visionary charismatics aren’t necessarily warm people, but they do feel strongly, even passionately, about their vision. And to be truly charismatic, their vision must include a certain amount of nobility and altruism. One reporter described Steve Jobs as being “driven by a nearly messianic zeal.… Jobs doesn’t sell computers. He sells the promise of a better world.” Visionary charismatics often promise redemption—think Joan of Arc or Martin Luther King Jr. With visionary charisma, you’re selling people on the vision more than on yourself. What people notice: We assess visionary charisma primarily through demeanor, which includes body language and behavior. Due to the fact that people tend to accept whatever you project, if you seem inspired, they will assume you have something to be inspired about. For visionary charisma, appearance matters far less than it does for other charisma styles. You could be wearing rags and still successfully convey visionary charisma.*  

- Page 104 (location ~ 1584-1595)    

*Once you have it: Visionary charisma can inspire fervent belief and lead monumental change. However, it can also inspire fanatical belief and lead people to disastrous decisions (cult leader Jim Jones persuaded nine hundred people to commit mass suicide). When to use it: Visionary charisma is important at times when you need to inspire people. It’s particularly helpful when you want to inspire creativity.*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1601-1604)    

*One of the reasons that the Dalai Lama has such a powerful effect on people is his ability to radiate both tremendous warmth and complete acceptance. People who may have never felt completely, wholeheartedly accepted suddenly feel truly seen and enveloped in acceptance. This is kindness charisma in action. Kindness charisma is primarily based on warmth. It connects with people’s hearts, and makes them feel welcomed, cherished, embraced, and, most of all, completely accepted. What people notice: Like visionary and focus charisma, kindness charisma comes entirely from body language—specifically your face, and even more specifically your eyes.*  

- Page 105 (location ~ 1608-1612)    

*Because kindness charisma is heavily dependent on warmth, it is vital to avoid any body language of tension, criticism, or coldness. The internal tools for dealing with mental or physical discomfort from chapter 4 can be invaluable here. Once you have it: Though kindness charisma is based primarily on warmth, without power you risk coming off as overeager to please. This is where the ability to convey a modicum of power becomes important. The tools you gained in chapter 5—visualization, warming up, and using your body to change your mind—will help you get the right mindset. The following chapters will help you balance warmth and power in your body language. Kindness charisma has its costs. One of my dear friends radiates such kindness charisma that people become enraptured wherever she goes. From colleagues at the office to cashiers at the supermarket, people feel accepted and cared for as soon as they’re in her presence. This can be lovely, but it can also be a heavy burden for her to carry. She suffers pain and guilt when these people, having become enchanted, feel hurt or resentful when she can’t make room for them in her life. This is one of the downsides of kindness charisma: it can lead to adulation and, potentially, overattachment. You will gain tools to prevent these side effects in chapter 13, on living a charismatic life. When to use it: Kindness charisma is perfect anytime you want to create an emotional bond or make people feel safe and comfortable. It can be critical in some situations, such as when you have to deliver bad news (see chapter 12). It can also be a surprisingly effective tool when dealing with difficult people (and chapter 12 will cover that, too). However, just as with focus charisma, you may want to avoid it when you need to appear authoritative or when there’s a risk that people might get too comfortable and share too much (thankfully, you have chapter 13 to help you avoid this).*  

- Page 106 (location ~ 1617-1633)    

*What people notice: Authority charisma is primarily based on a perception of power: the belief that this person has the power to affect our world. We evaluate someone’s authority charisma through four indicators: body language, appearance, title, and the reactions of others. We appraise body language first and foremost. Does it emanate confidence in the person’s power to influence others, or to affect the world around them? Second, we assess appearance. We are biologically programmed to care about status and to be impressed by it because this instinctive reaction favors our survival: high-status individuals have the power to help or hurt us. To survive, we need to know where in the pecking order we stand. As a consequence, we’re exquisitely fine-tuned to any clues that can help us determine other people’s status. Clothing is one of our first and strongest clues in evaluating status, thus potential power, and thus authority charisma. We look for signs of expertise (doctors’ white coats) or high authority (military or police uniforms). We pay particular attention to signs of high social status or success, such as expensive clothing. In one experiment conducted in New York City, people tended to follow a jaywalker dressed in an expensive suit sooner than one dressed in more casual clothing.*  

- Page 107 (location ~ 1640-1650)    

*In another experiment, a researcher conducted fake surveys in shopping malls wearing either a designer-logo sweater or a no-logo sweater. When faced with the designer label, 52 percent of people agreed to take the survey, compared with only 13 percent who saw no logo. Expensive logos also affected people’s charitable impulses. Research assistants brought in nearly twice as many donations when their shirts bore a visible designer label than they did when they wore (otherwise identical) no-label shirts.3 Finally, a person’s title and the way others react to them give us more clues about their authority charisma, though these last two factors carry less weight than the previous two. Instinctively, we understand that someone who has a high title but garners little respect has less real power than someone of lower title who is greatly respected.*

*Your main aim if you want to gain authority charisma is to project power by displaying signs of status and confidence. Luckily, the two most important dimensions of status and confidence are also the ones over which you have the most influence: body language and appearance. Because it is affected so strongly by body language, your authority charisma depends on how confident you feel in that moment. This is where the tools you gained in chapter 5 come in: you can use visualizations, warm-ups, or your body to change your mind to get into a confident mental state. To project power and confidence in your body language, you’ll need to learn how to “take up space” with your posture, reduce nonverbal reassurances (such as excessive nodding), and avoid fidgeting. You may need to speak less, to speak more slowly, to know how and when to pause your sentences, or how to modulate your intonation. We’ll cover all the specifics of emanating power through your body language in chapter 9. As far as appearance goes, choosing clothing that appears expensive or high-status is one of the easiest ways to look authoritative.*

Once you have it: Authority charisma has the advantage that you get listened to and often obeyed. It does, however, have several disadvantages: It can inhibit critical thinking in others. It doesn’t invite feedback, so you risk not receiving information you actually need. It can easily make you appear arrogant. This is where learning to emanate warmth can be your saving grace. Not only will your warmth reduce the risk of your being perceived as arrogant or intimidating, it will also be more highly valued because you’re now seen as high-status. If a low-status person is eager to please us, we may find this pleasant, but we don’t necessarily value their eagerness very highly. After all, they can’t do much for us; it’s rather we who can do things for them. On the other hand, if a high-status alpha grants us attention and warmth, we’re thrilled, because they can move mountains.*

*When are certain styles more effective? Which style will suit you best? Determining your preferred charisma style and knowing when to use it is a crucial step toward fulfilling your charisma potential. Different kinds of charisma will be appropriate in different circumstances. And different kinds of charisma will be a better or poorer fit for you. To decide which elements of charisma to bring out you’ll need to assess three indicators: what’s best suited to your personality, your goals, and the situation. Your personality: It’s important to know what feels right for you, and to choose the styles, tools, and techniques that match your signature strengths. Your goals: You also need to be clear on what you want to achieve. Some modes of charisma will make people obey you, others will lead them to open up and share. The situation: What context are you stepping into? The situation sets the stage upon which your charisma will play out.*  

- Page 110 (location ~ 1685-1692)    

*Not only do you not have to force yourself into one particular charisma style, you don’t have to limit yourself to just one style. These styles are just examples of how the different elements of charisma play out in the world around us. In reality, you can alternate between several modes of charisma, from one moment to the next. The more modes you master, the more versatile you can be. The ability to adapt to a variety of social situations is characteristic of highly charismatic people. Hayes Barnard, the charismatic CEO of Paramount Equity, told me that he sees himself as a Swiss Army knife, adaptable to any situation. When he moves through a room, he intentionally varies his voice and body language according to the person or people he is speaking*  

- Page 112 (location ~ 1709-1714)    

*Presidents Clinton and Obama both embody visionary charisma. Both have a touch of authority. However, Obama leads with focus. People who meet him say that his intelligence is palpable, and that he intensely focuses on whomever he is interacting with. Clinton, on the other hand, leads with warmth. He’s known for being “off-the-charts empathetic.” When choosing a charisma style, remember to check in with your mental and emotional state. If you’re feeling insecure, don’t try to pull off authority charisma until you’ve regained your confidence. Instead, choose a charisma style that demands less confidence, such as focus or kindness, and then gradually move to authority if you so desire. Or take the time to ramp up your confidence so you will be ready to broadcast authority charisma.*  

- Page 113 (location ~ 1720-1726)    

*To get a sense for the emotional context around you, simply ask yourself: How are the people around you feeling? What do they need in this moment? If you’re firing someone, authority charisma might not be most fitting—you may want to bring out focus or kindness charisma instead.*  

- Page 114 (location ~ 1738-1740)    

*Social context matters, too: one behavior could be seen as charismatic in the United States but not in Japan. The same amount of eye contact that would be welcomed as an honest, straightforward gaze in most of North America could be seen as aggressive and obnoxious in parts of Asia. Though presence, warmth, and power are the fundamental elements of charisma, how they get expressed varies somewhat from culture to culture.*  

- Page 114 (location ~ 1741-1744)    

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Choosing the right charisma style depends on your personality, goals, and the situation. You can alternate among different charisma styles or even blend them together. Don’t force yourself into a charisma style that is just too awkward for you. Doing so would negatively affect how you feel and how others perceive you. The more charisma styles you can access, the more versatile and confident you will be. Stretch out of your comfort zone in low-stakes situations. Stick with styles you already know well in high-stakes situations. Let goodwill be your safety net. Coming from a place of genuine goodwill gives you the best chance of getting your charisma right.*  

- Page 115 (location ~ 1760-1769)    

*Is it possible to overcome a bad first impression? Yes, it is. Over the course of several meetings, you can sometimes change a person’s initial perception of you. But you’ll have to work much harder than if you’d come across as charismatic from the start. Why do split-second impressions last for so long? One reason is that, according to economist John Kenneth Galbraith, when “faced with the choice between changing one’s mind and proving there is no need to do so, almost everyone gets busy on the proof.”1 Behavioral research has since proven him right. Once we’ve made a judgment about someone, we spend the rest of our acquaintanceship seeking to prove ourselves correct. Everything we see and hear gets filtered through this initial impression.*  

- Page 116 (location ~ 1776-1783)    

*“We have long known that people jump to conclusions about others on the basis of very little information,” said one of the researchers, “but what’s striking about these findings is how many of the impressions have a kernel of truth to them, even on the basis of a single photograph.”3 Further studies confirmed that we’re often quite accurate in our perceptions of personality, even after meeting someone for only a few seconds.4 One Harvard research team showed students a two-second silent clip of a teacher they had never seen before, and asked them to evaluate the teacher’s effectiveness. The researchers then compared these evaluations with those of students who’d experienced this same teacher for a full semester. Both sets of evaluations were impressively similar. 5 This means that without hearing a word from the teacher or attending one class, complete strangers could predict with fair accuracy the ratings this teacher would receive.*

*In hunter-gatherer times, we often had only a split second to determine whether shapes entering our field of vision were animate or inanimate, human or nonhuman, friend or foe—in other words “fight, flight, or relax?” Those able to accurately make these split-second decisions survived, thrived, and multiplied. Those who couldn’t ended up as somebody else’s protein snack. Today, even in sophisticated business settings, we still operate on hunter-gatherer survival instincts. When we first meet someone, our instinctive question is: friend or foe? How friendly are their intentions likely to be? To find an answer we still look to the clues that were so useful in tribal times: appearance and demeanor. If there’s any chance the person could*

*So how can you make a fantastic first impression? Our default setting here is actually quite simple: people like people who are like them. During the vast majority of our history, from which our current instincts are drawn, people lived in tribes. In such an environment, the ability to accurately recognize whether or not someone was of your tribe could have life-and-death implications. If you know how to get these instinctive responses working in your favor, you’ve won half the battle.*

*You wouldn’t wear a Hawaiian shirt in an investment bank, nor would you wear a three-piece suit in a start-up. Dress codes can vary even within the same industry—a tax lawyer might not wear the same suit as an entertainment lawyer. If you want to impress others, look at the range of choices within that environment and choose the upper end. There’s a reason the phrase “Dress to impress” exists.*

*A Fortune 500 CEO once said that when he had to choose between two candidates with similar qualifications, he gave the position to the candidate with the better handshake. Extreme? Perhaps, but management experts at the University of Iowa analyzing interactions in job interviews declared handshakes “more important than agreeableness, conscientiousness, or emotional stability.”7 Other studies determined that a handshake improves the quality of the interaction, producing a higher degree of intimacy and trust within a matter of seconds.*

*Having a great handshake is critical to authority charisma—can you imagine a powerful figure with a limp, weak handshake? Though it may seem inconsequential, a handshake is indeed a serious step in intimacy. The physical contact involved requires that the personal space barrier be suspended, if only for a moment. It therefore requires trust. If the trust is validated (the handshake goes well), the first step in a relationship is made. The first commonly known depiction of a handshake was found in Egyptian frescoes dating back to around 2800 B.C. To this day, across cultures and hemispheres, the handshake remains surprisingly common—and always features the right hand. Since that was the one traditionally used for wielding weapons, shaking the right hand was symbolic of a suspension of danger, showing that the greeter’s weapon hand was unarmed. In Roman times, the handshake was in fact an arm clasp. Each man would clasp just below the elbow of the other. This gesture afforded a better opportunity to feel for daggers hidden in sleeves. Medieval knights took precautions a step further by adding a shake to the clasp to dislodge any hidden weapons, and thus the handshake was born.*  

- Page 121 (location ~ 1852-1861)    

*An easy way to start interactions in a way that both communicates warmth and sends the conversation down the right path is to offer a compliment about something the person is wearing. This would be a great opener when you’re aiming to broadcast either kindness charisma or focus charisma. It can also be a good way to balance out the power in your authority charisma if you think a more subdued version of your power is needed. Continue with an open-ended question, such as “What’s the story behind it?” The word story has a very strong emotional effect on most people—it sends them straight into storytelling mode, which instantly changes the rapport between the two of you. In addition, because they chose to wear this item, they most likely have a positive feeling about it. Another good question to break the ice with is “Where are you from?” No matter what the answer, it will encourage further dialogue. Whether they answer “New York” or “New Delhi,” if you’re not from that area, you can follow up with “What was it like growing up there?” The smaller the town of origin, the more delighted they will be that you have expressed interest.*  

- Page 124 (location ~ 1897-1905)    

*If they start asking about you and you want to refocus the conversation on them, use the bounce back technique. Answer the question with a fact, add a personal note, and redirect the question to them, as follows: Other Person: “So where are you moving to?” You: “To Chelsea [fact]. We fell in love with the parks and the bakeries [personal note]. What do you think of the neighborhood [redirect]?” Remember, it’s all about keeping the spotlight on them for as long as possible. “Talk to a man about himself, and he will listen for hours,” said Benjamin Disraeli. In fact, even when you’re speaking, the one word that should pop up most often in your conversation is not I but you. Instead of saying “I read a great article on that subject in the New York Times,” try “You might enjoy the recent New York Times article on the subject.” Or simply insert “You know…” before any sentence to make them instantly perk up and pay attention. To make yourself even more relatable, adjust your choice of words,*

*Graceful Exits Just as a first impression can color the rest of the interaction, so can the last few moments. Becoming a charismatic conversationalist means that people will really enjoy being around you, and may be increasingly reluctant to let you go. In fact, the more charismatic you become, the harder it will be to escape your newfound fans. Many charismatic people mention this as one of their biggest challenges. So how can you gracefully exit a conversation? First, don’t wait too long to end it. Otherwise, you and your partner will feel the strain and become uncomfortable. The easiest way to exit is, of course, to have an official reason for doing so. That’s one of the many reasons to be a volunteer or acquire some official duty at parties. When you’re “on duty,” people will actually expect you to spend no more than a few minutes with them. Another way to exit a conversation with grace is to offer something of value: Information: an article, book, or Web site you think might be of use to them A connection: someone they ought to meet whom you know and can introduce them to Visibility: an organization you belong to, where you could invite them to speak Recognition: an award you think they should be nominated for Offering value will often create in others a feeling of warmth and goodwill toward you, and your departure from the conversation will be haloed by the impression of generosity you’ve created.*

*conversation they’ve indicated they wanted to leave, or you need to introduce them to someone*

*What if you’re the one breaking up a group? Perhaps you’re rescuing someone from a conversation they’ve indicated they wanted to leave, or you need to introduce them to someone else, or one of the group is needed for another duty. In this case, focus all your attention, with particularly warm eye contact (see chapter 9 for this), not on the person you’re taking with you but on the person who is being left behind. This minimizes the chances of their feeling excluded and is particularly important for conveying either kindness charisma or focus charisma. A good way to phrase things is: “I’m so sorry, but Christopher is needed to [fill in the blank]. Would you allow me to bring him over there?” This also gives them at least a nominal feeling of having a choice in the matter. Once a conversation is over, don’t waste time worrying about what you said, what you wish you hadn’t said, or what you’ll say next time. As the MIT Media Lab studies showed, what impacts people isn’t the words or content used. Rather, they remember how it felt to be speaking with you.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS First impressions happen within seconds and can affect not only the rest of the interaction but also the rest of your relationship with that person. People feel most comfortable with those who are similar to them in some way, including appearance and behavior. Do your homework and decide how much you want to adapt your dress and word choice to your environment. A good handshake can go a long way. Likewise, a bad one can leave an unfavorable and lasting first impression. It’s worth spending some time perfecting the right way to greet someone. Great conversationalists keep the spotlight on the other person and make them feel good about themselves. Know how to gracefully exit a conversation, leaving others with positive feelings.*

*When I ask my clients to name the first skill they would improve upon in their people if they could wave a magic wand, most of the CEOs say, “Better listening skills.” They may not sound complex or glamorous, but listening skills are an absolute requirement for charisma, and most charisma masters possess them in abundance. By being a great listener you can make people feel completely heard and understood without saying a word. In fact, it’s remarkably easy to impress people just by listening attentively. We’re about to cover three keys to communicating presence: attentive listening, refraining from interrupting, and deliberate pausing. Listening comes first and foremost, because listening lays the groundwork for the presence that is fundamental to charisma.*  

- Page 129 (location ~ 1969-1975)    

*I’m sure you know that listening is important. But did you know that just a few tweaks can bring your listening skills from good to truly extraordinary? Great listening skills start with the right mindset: both the willingness and the mental ability to be present, pay attention, and focus on what the other person is saying. As you can imagine, this is absolutely key for conveying focus charisma, though it can boost any of the other charisma styles, too. One of the most common mistakes my clients make is equating listening with “letting people talk until it’s my turn.” Sorry, but that’s not sufficient. Even if the other person is doing all the talking, you can’t let your mind wander while waiting for your turn to speak. Even if what you’re thinking about is what you want to say next, your lack of presence will be written all over your face. The other person will see that you’re not fully present and are just waiting for them to finish so you can jump in. Presence is a cornerstone of effective listening. You already have all the tools you need to avoid mind-wandering while someone else is talking: If zoning out is the issue, bring yourself back to the moment by focusing on physical sensations, like the feeling in your toes or your breath flowing in and out of your body. If impatience is the issue, handle it by delving into the minute physical sensations you’re feeling. Then get back to the person.*

*Great listeners know to let others interrupt them. When someone interrupts you, let them! Were they right to interrupt you? Of course not. But even if they were wrong, it’s not worth making them feel wrong; your job instead is to make them feel right. In fact, if you notice the other person repeatedly agitating to speak, keep your sentences short and leave frequent pauses for them to jump in. People really do love to hear themselves talk. The more you let them speak, the more they will like you. One young executive told me: “In job interviews, I’ve gotten offers simply by going in for an interview and letting the interviewer talk for ninety percent of the time. I walk out and they absolutely love me since we talked about what mattered most to them.”*  

- Page 131 (location ~ 1994-1999)    

*Master listeners know one extra trick, one simple but extraordinarily effective habit that will make people feel truly listened to and understood: they pause before they answer. The pianist Artur Schnabel once said, “The notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the notes—ah, that is where the art resides.”2 Knowing how and when to pause is also an art in business conversations, and something that most charismatic conversationalists do naturally. Considered a key tool in negotiation, pausing can also play a wonderful role in making people feel good about themselves when they’re around you—it’s an easy way to make people feel intelligent, interesting, and even impressive. When someone has spoken, see if you can let your facial expression react first, showing that you’re absorbing what they’ve just said and giving their brilliant statement the consideration it deserves. Only then, after about two seconds, do you answer. The sequence goes like this: They finish their sentence Your face absorbs Your face reacts Then, and only then, you answer*

*Our minds link the sensations we’re experiencing to the places, people, and physical sensations we notice while we’re experiencing them. This is why car manufacturers often include highly attractive female models in the ads promoting their cars. (It works: in a study, men asked to evaluate cars whose ads featured attractive female models rated the cars as faster, cooler, and more desirable.)3 The same association happens with negative feelings, which is why TV weather forecasters often receive hate mail from viewers who so strongly associate the meteorologists with the weather they report that they believe these folks actually cause the weather. It’s not unusual during nasty seasons for a forecaster to receive at least one death threat.*

*How do you feel when someone pays you a compliment? For instance, when someone says you look good or you have accomplished something impressive, do you instinctively downplay it? For many people, compliments feel both pleasant and a little awkward, and they don’t quite know how to handle them. Many of us either turn bashful or modestly deflect the compliment by saying something like “Oh, it’s nothing…” Unfortunately, doing this sends a message to your admirer that they were wrong to compliment you. They will probably feel rather foolish, and there’s even a chance that they will associate this experience of feeling foolish with you. If you do this enough, pretty soon they’ll stop trying. If, on the other hand, you make them feel good for complimenting you, they’ll enjoy feeling good about themselves, and so will want to do it again. The next time you’re given a compliment, the following steps will help you skillfully handle the moment: Stop. Absorb the compliment. Enjoy it if you can. Let that second of absorption show on your face. Show the person that they’ve had an impact. Thank them. Saying “Thank you very much” is enough, but you can take it a step further by thanking them for their thoughtfulness or telling them that they’ve made your day.*

*Creating positive associations to highlight the warmth dimension means that you make a person feel good when they’re around you. Clinton is known to make everyone he’s speaking to feel as if they were the most important person in the room. How can you make people feel this way? First, think about how you would behave if you were indeed speaking to the most important person in the room. You would probably want to hear everything they had to say. You’d be truly interested, maybe even impressed, and that attitude is exactly what will make people feel great about themselves and associate all those feelings with you. As Dale Carnegie said, “You can make more friends in two months by becoming truly interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.”5 One great trick is to imagine that the person you’re speaking with is the main star in a movie you’re watching right now. This will help you find them more interesting, and there’s even a chance that you’ll make them feel like a movie star, too. Charismatic people are masters at using positive associations, whether consciously or subconsciously, and you’ll often hear people rave about how “special” and “wonderful” these charismatics made them feel. I tell all my clients: Don’t try to impress people. Let them impress you, and they will love you for it. Believe it or not, you don’t need to sound smart. You just need to make them feel smart.*

*Our brain’s language-processing abilities are much newer and less deeply wired than are our visual-processing abilities. When you speak in words, the brain has to relate the words to concepts, then translate the concepts into images, which is what actually gets understood. Why not speak directly in the brain’s own language? Whenever you can, choose to speak in pictures. You’ll have a much greater impact, and your message will be far more memorable. Visionary charismatics make full use of the power of images. Presidents rated as charismatic, such as Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, used twice as many visual metaphors in their inaugural addresses as did those rated as noncharismatic.*

*One of the aforementioned accounting firm’s rising stars asked me to help him communicate the importance of a complex new regulation in such a way that everyone would realize just how critical it was to ensure clients’ abidance. Here’s the metaphor we came up with: “If you don’t bring your clients into compliance, it’s as if they’re innocently paddling along a river, and you know there’s a waterfall coming, yet you do nothing to stop them from going over the waterfall, watching as they crash down to the rocks below, their bodies mangled, blood spilling through the water.” Harsh? Yes. Effective? You bet.*

*Whenever people are asked to expend any of their scarce resources, you can bet that they are (at least subconsciously) measuring the return on their investment. You can deliver value to others in multiple ways: Entertainment: Make your e-mail or meeting enjoyable. Information: Give interesting or informative content that they can use. Good feelings: Find ways to make them feel important or good about themselves. The longer you speak, the higher the price you’re making them pay, so the higher the value ought to be. Professional speakers, when rehearsing a new presentation, will often have their first attempt taped and transcribed, and then go over each sentence, aiming to tighten their speech as much as possible. In fact, aiming to deliver high value for low effort brings together all the points we’ve covered in this section. When you speak or write, use few words and lots of pictures, and strive to make your communications useful, enjoyable, and even entertaining.*  

- Page 139 (location ~ 2130-2138)    

*Studies have consistently shown that audience ratings of a lecture are more strongly influenced by delivery style than by content.8 Your voice is key to communicating both warmth and power, but there isn’t just one charismatic voice. You can choose to play up different aspects of your voice depending on what you want to convey and with whom you’re communicating. When the MIT Media Lab concluded that they could predict the success of sales calls without listening to a single word, these are the only two measurements they needed: Ratio of speaking to listening Amount of voice fluctuation Earlier in this chapter, we explored how to balance speaking with listening. The second important vocal feature is fluctuation. The degree to which your voice fluctuates affects your persuasiveness and your charisma. Increasing voice fluctuation means making your voice vary in any of the following ways: pitch (high or low), volume (loud or quiet), tone (resonant or hollow), tempo (fast or slow), or rhythm (fluid or staccato).*  

- Page 141 (location ~ 2149-2158)    

*Putting It into Practice: Vocal Power The guidelines below will help you broadcast power through your voice. Speak slowly. Visualize the contrast between a nervous, squeaky teenager speaking at high speed and the slow, emphatic tone of a judge delivering a verdict. Pause. People who broadcast confidence often pause while speaking. They will pause for a second or two between sentences or even in the middle of a sentence. This conveys the feeling that they’re so confident in their power, they trust that people won’t interrupt. Drop intonation. You know how a voice rises at the end of a question? Just reread the last sentence and hear your voice go up at the end. Now imagine an assertion: a judge saying “This case is closed.” Feel how the intonation of the word closed drops. Lowering the intonation of your voice at the end of a sentence broadcasts power. When you want to sound superconfident, you can even lower your intonation midsentence. Check your breathing. Make sure you’re breathing deeply into your belly and inhale and exhale through your nose rather than your mouth. Breathing through your mouth can make you sound breathless and anxious.*  

- Page 142 (location ~ 2167-2177)    

*There’s only one thing you need to do in order to project more warmth in your voice: smile. Smiling affects how we speak to such an extent that listeners in one study could identify sixteen different kinds of smiles based on sound alone.9 This is why it’s worth smiling even when on the phone. What about cases in which you don’t necessarily want to smile? The good news is that you don’t need to actually smile: often, just thinking about smiling is enough to give your voice more warmth. Although there isn’t one single way to achieve a charismatic delivery, here’s an effective visual to simultaneously convey power and warmth.*  

- Page 142 (location ~ 2178-2183)    

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Power, presence, and warmth are important for both charismatic speaking and charismatic listening. Great listening skills are key to communicating charismatic presence. Never interrupt people, and occasionally pause a second or two before you answer. People associate you with the feelings you produce in them. Avoid creating negative associations: don’t make them feel bad or wrong. Make people feel good, especially about themselves. Don’t try to impress them—let them impress you, and they will love you for it. Get graphic: use pictures, metaphors, and sensory-rich language to convey a compelling, charismatic message. Use as few words as possible, and deliver as much value as possible: entertainment, information, or good feelings. To emanate vocal power, use a slow, measured tempo; insert pauses between your sentences; and drop your intonation at the end. To emanate vocal warmth, you need to do only one thing: smile, or even just imagine smiling.*

*FOR NEARLY AN hour, Ronald Riggio, one of charisma’s main researchers, had been fascinated, without understanding a word of content. What the speaker was saying was clearly not important to his spellbinding power. How he was saying it was enough. Words are grasped first by people’s cognitive minds, their logical side, which gets to work on understanding their meaning. Body language, in contrast, affects us on a visceral, emotional level. It’s this emotional level that you need to access in order to inspire others to follow, care for, or obey you. Business guru Alan Weiss likes to say, “Logic makes people think. Emotion makes them act.” Which would you rather have? If you speak only to people’s logical mind, you’re missing half the playing field. Charisma, which makes us feel impressed, inspired, or thrillingly special, speaks to our emotional side. It bypasses our logical thinking. Just as the feeling of awe goes beyond our understanding and touches us at an emotional level, so does charisma.*  

- Page 145 (location ~ 2210-2217)    

*In some situations, the delivery of a message has a much greater impact than the message itself. For instance, the Harvard Business Review detailed research showing that when negative performance reviews were accompanied by positive body language, employees received them far better than they received positive reviews delivered with negative body language.1 Our tendency to react to how something is said more than to what is said is particularly strong in high-stakes situations—whether it’s trying to win a new client, impress a new boss, or make a new friend. In high-stakes situations we react more strongly to body language than to words because our fight-or-flight response activates and a more primal part of the brain takes over. This part of the brain does not directly comprehend words or ideas. Instead, it’s immediately impacted by body language.*  

- Page 145 (location ~ 2221-2228)    

*Your body language is particularly important if you’re in a position of leadership because of the process known as emotional contagion. Behavioral scientists define this as “the process by which the emotions expressed by one individual are ‘caught’ by another.” Charismatic people are known to be more “contagious”; they have a strong ability to transmit their emotions to others. As a leader, the emotions conveyed by your body language, even during brief, casual encounters, can have a ripple effect through your team or even your entire company. This ripple effect is due to the mirror neurons in our brain, whose job it is to replicate or mirror in our own mind the emotions we observe in someone else. When we detect someone else’s emotions through their behaviors or facial expressions, our mirror neurons reproduce these emotions. This is what makes empathy possible. I’m often called in by leaders with strong personalities who already have powerful charisma and need to learn how to manage their emotional contagion. We analyze what impact they’re having on whom, and then give them the skills to control it at will. Let’s imagine that you interact with someone while in an anxious emotional state. As they read your body language, their mirror neurons fire up, mirroring that state. They go on to meet someone else, replicating the process—and your emotional state spreads. Emotional contagion “triggers arousal in others, in a sort of chain reaction.”2 Within organizations, leaders’ emotions always propagate fastest because people are strongly affected by those in a position of power (we can thank our survival instincts for this, too). Through emotional contagion, your emotions can strongly affect your followers’ effectiveness.*

*Have you ever noticed that people who have been married for many years often end up looking like each other? It’s actually a well-documented fact that as we spend time together, we tend to adapt to each other’s body language.4 This naturally includes our facial expressions, which end up shaping our faces in similar ways by repeatedly using the same facial muscles. This tendency to mimic the body language of others is technically called limbic resonance, and it’s hardwired into the human brain. Limbic resonance is made possible thanks to a certain class of neurons called oscillators, which coordinate people physically by regulating how and when their bodies move together. Daniel Goleman details in the Harvard Business Review what happens when two accomplished cellists play together. Not only do they hit their notes in unison, but, thanks to oscillators, their right brain hemispheres are more closely coordinated to each other’s than they are to the left hemispheres of their own brains!*

*When you consciously mirror someone’s body language, you activate deep instincts of trust and liking. For this reason, it can be a great aid when you need people to open up. A former political journalist mentioned how effective mirroring was during interviews. “People get share-oriented,” he told me. They just instinctively start sharing more. Several studies across the world have found that mirroring someone’s body language can get them to pick up your dropped items, buy your products, or give you a better deal. Mirroring even makes you more attractive to others.*  

- Page 148 (location ~ 2262-2266)    

*During your next few conversations, try to mirror the other person’s overall posture: the way they hold their head, how they place their feet, the shifts in their weight. If they move their left hand, move your right hand. Aim also to adapt your voice to theirs in speed, pitch, and intonation. Because people focus primarily on themselves while interacting, they usually won’t notice that you’re mirroring unless you are exceedingly obvious about it. However, here are some ways to increase subtlety: Be selective: do only what feels natural to you. For instance, some gestures are gender-specific. Use variations in amplitude: if they make a big gesture, you could make a smaller one. Use lag time: let a few seconds elapse before you move into a mirrored position.*  

- Page 148 (location ~ 2267-2273)    

*As Darius’s story shows, mirroring someone’s body language is often enough to achieve rapport and sometimes enough to bring them around to your point of view. Mirroring is also one of the few techniques that can help overcome a bad first impression. It’s extraordinarily effective. In fact, I can tell you that although I teach this material, the techniques still work on me even when I realize people are using them! But what about cases in which the other person is exhibiting negative body language? Do you still mirror then? Well, it depends. In some situations, you want to first mirror their body language, then gradually lead it in a more positive direction.*  

- Page 150 (location ~ 2297-2302)    

*Once you’re in a mirrored position, spend your entire listening time in that mode: as long as you’re listening, match your body language to hers. Only when it’s your turn to speak should you start infusing the interaction with warmth, caring, and compassion through your voice, face, and eyes. As you speak, gradually shift into a more relaxed, calm, and, eventually, confident posture. There’s a good chance that she’ll follow. Mirror-then-lead is a smart strategy when the person you’re interacting with needs reassurance—when they’re feeling nervous or timid, anxious or awkward, stiff or withdrawn. With any of these emotional states, mirror them to establish comfort and rapport, and then gradually draw them out. In these situations, it’s not a good idea to try to influence their body language too forcefully.*  

- Page 151 (location ~ 2308-2314)    

*On the other hand, there are instances where you do not want to mirror a person’s body language. If their demeanor is angry or defensive, mirroring would only escalate the tension. Say you’re meeting with a manager who has denied a request you made, and who is sitting in a defensive position—leaning back with his arms and legs crossed and his hands balled into fists. Rather than mirroring, try breaking him out of his posture by handing him something: a piece of paper or a pen—whatever works. And then, as soon as he’s in a new position, distract him by giving him new information or changing the subject while you mirror his posture to reestablish rapport.*

*Behavioral scientists can predict which stall people will choose in a communal bathroom with startling accuracy. People consistently follow a specific pattern, depending on which stalls are already occupied. Our adherence to personal space rules is so strong, it’s even been found that people who play virtual-reality games obey real-life personal space rules within the game. The concept of personal space evolved from mid-twentieth-century studies of zoo animals’ behavior.7 In the same manner that animals define and defend their territories, we humans feel “ownership” of the space around us. This territory, even if it’s just a few inches, is felt as an extension of our bodies, and we act to preserve this space and react strongly if it is invaded. Being charismatic means making others feel comfortable, at ease, and good about themselves when they are around us. In nonverbal communication, one crucial element for making people feel at ease and establishing rapport is respecting the amount of personal space people need to be comfortable. Conversely, not respecting people’s personal-space preferences can create high levels of discomfort, and those emotions could become associated with you. It’s worth paying attention.*  

- Page 152 (location ~ 2322-2331)    

*The next time you want to establish warm rapport with someone, avoid a confrontational seating arrangement and instead sit either next to or at a 90-degree angle from them. These are the positions in which we feel most comfortable. In fact, this is an exercise you can try out with a partner. <U+2666> Start a conversation sitting next to each other. <U+2666> After five minutes, change positions so that you’re sitting across from each other. You’ll likely feel a clear difference in comfort level. <U+2666> After another five minutes, move to a 90-degree angle and feel the difference. <U+2666> Finally, come back to your original position sitting next to each other. Pay close attention to the rise and fall of feelings of trust and comfort throughout the exercise. If you want someone to feel comfortable, avoid seating them with their back to an open space, particularly if others are moving behind them. This kind of seating position causes the breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure to increase rapidly, especially if the person’s back is toward an open door or a window at ground level.9 And by association, their discomfort would likely affect their perception of you.*

*Anthropologist Helen Fisher explains that when you stare with intensity at someone, it can speed up their heart rate and send a hormone called phenylethylamine, or PEA, coursing through their bloodstream. PEA is the same hormone that produces the phenomenon we call love at first sight. In one study, complete strangers were asked to count the number of times the person across from them blinked. This was just a ploy to get people to look deeply into each other’s eyes without feeling the awkwardness that usually arises. Within just a few minutes, people reported increased affection, and some even passionate feelings, for each other.10 So obviously, you don’t want to overdo it, but it can be very effective. Our eyes are a key part of our nonverbal communication, perhaps the single most important one. Why are eyes called the “windows to the soul”? Because they are the most mobile part of the entire face—and so, the most expressive.*  

- Page 155 (location ~ 2363-2371)    

*Eye contact is so meaningful to us that our brains are hardwired to experience separation distress whenever someone with whom we have significant eye contact turns away. One good way to avoid creating this anxiety is to keep eye contact for three full seconds at the end of your interaction with someone. This may sound short, but it’ll actually feel endless! If you can get into the habit of doing this, you’ll find it well worth the effort. With just a few seconds’ investment, people will feel you have truly paid attention to them. Two of the most common eye-contact issues people have are lack of eye contact due to shyness and lack of eye contact due to distraction. Either, unfortunately, can ruin your charisma potential. One technique works equally well for both of these: delving into sensations. As you look into someone’s eyes, pay attention to the physical sensations you are feeling in that very moment. If shyness is the issue, this helps to dedramatize the discomfort. If distraction is the issue, this technique will help you keep your mind focused in the present moment. You can also look at the different colors you see in their eyes, the different shades playing around their pupils.*  

- Page 155 (location ~ 2373-2382)    

*Putting It into Practice: Charismatic Eyes To truly understand how different your face appears when your eyes are relaxed and open, go see the transformation for yourself. <U+2666> Find a room with a mirror where you won’t be disturbed for a few minutes. <U+2666> Close your eyes and think of a recent annoyance—some minor issue that’s been bugging you lately, or an unpleasant task such as doing your taxes. <U+2666> When you feel the irritation take hold, open your eyes and look closely in the mirror. Note the tension around your eyes, their narrowness. <U+2666> Now close your eyes and think of something that would induce warm feelings—a recent pleasant experience, like time spent with a good friend. <U+2666> When the warmth has arisen, open your eyes and look at that precise kind of relaxation. That’s what warmth looks like. <U+2666> Close your eyes once more and think of an exciting time when you felt full of confidence and on top of the world—receiving a triumph, an award, some brilliant news. <U+2666> When you’ve accessed the feeling of confidence, open your eyes again and note closely what they look like now. That’s what confidence looks like.*  

- Page 157 (location ~ 2394-2404)    

*Because we can’t peer into people’s hearts and minds, we assume attributes from the clues we observe. When someone displays high confidence through their body language, we tend to assume they have something to be confident about: people simply accept what you project. Any increase in the amount of confidence your body language projects will bring you major charisma rewards. Projecting power and confidence is what allows you to emanate warmth, enthusiasm, and excitement without coming across as overeager or subservient. Because body language is wired so deeply within us, signs of confidence (or lack thereof) in someone’s body language have veto power over all other signs of power. No matter how many signs of power and high status we may project through our appearance, title, or even through others’ deference, a body language of insecurity will kill charisma on the spot. On the other hand, a body language of confidence can endow its bearer with charisma even when no other power signs are present.*

*When we think of boxing matches and what helps an opponent win or lose in the ring, most of us think of strength, speed, and agility. And these are all true. But as many professional boxers will tell you, a lot happens before the opponents even set foot in the arena, well before the first punch is thrown. The way the fighters carry themselves—how impressive and intimidating they seem—can play a decisive role in the fight. Though you may not realize it, your subconscious mind is constantly scanning your surroundings as you move through your environment to glean the information you need to keep moving forward. Your eyes scan and assess potential obstacles, including other people in your way. To determine whether you need to modify your route to avoid them, you read their body language without even realizing it. If they’re broadcasting a body language that says, “You better move aside, baby,” you will most likely pick up on it and make way for them. Conversely, if you feel that you’re the bigger gorilla, you’ll stay your course and expect them to deviate. Right now, close your eyes and imagine a very large gorilla. A rival has just breached his territory, and the gorilla is furious. He goes charging through the jungle, reaches the top branch of the top tree, and from there wants to broadcast his presence all around and intimidate the rival off his territory. What would he do? He’d likely inflate his chest and pound it with his fists—both of these actions have the effect of making him look bigger.*

*Deborah Gruenfeld, organizational behavior professor at Stanford’s business school, says that “Powerful people sit sideways on chairs, drape their arms over the back, or appropriate two chairs by placing an arm across the back of an adjacent chair. They put their feet on the desk. They sit on the desk.” All of these behaviors, she says, are ways of claiming space. The next time you’re out in a crowded environment, practice getting people to move aside for you. You could even do this on your way to work. First, visualize what a big gorilla would look like charging down the street. Then adopt the corresponding body language: imagine you’re a big gorilla about to go charging down the street and let your body express that. Take up as much space as you can. Inflate your chest and charge through the crowd. You might even swing your arms as you go, taking up yet more space.*

*The desire to convey reassurance can stem from two different sources: Empathy: wanting to ensure that the other person feels heard and understood and knows you’re paying attention Insecurity: wanting to please or appease the person you’re interacting with In contrast, people who come across as powerful, confident, or high-status are usually more contained; they don’t feel the urge to give so much reassurance because they’re not as worried about what their counterpart is thinking. Imagine yourself in a royal court. Picture a nervous servant anxiously bobbing and curtseying. Now imagine the opposite: the king or queen. Poised and powerful, they don’t need to make a move. When you want to increase your poise, there are three major issues to look out for. The first is excessive or rapid nodding. Nodding once for emphasis or to express agreement is fine and can be an effective communication method, but nodding three or four times in rapid succession is not. This is what one of my clients has come to call “the bobble head.” The second hindrance is excessive verbal reassurance: making a sound, such as “uh-huh,” or a half-sentence, such as “Oh, I agree.” Done once, and consciously, this is fine; multiple times per sentence is not. The third issue is restlessness or fidgeting (tapping your pencil or foot, or rearranging items on the table). Fidgeting decreases presence, thus charisma. Even when you have warmth, confidence, and are mentally present, if you are physically restless, you can’t be charismatic. Your body language is sending distracting signals. I know one particular young entrepreneur who is both confident and warm, yet his restless tics and incessant fidgeting make him seem odd and eccentric. He comes across as a child who can’t keep still and has a hard time being taken seriously. How to break these habits? The first step is awareness—you need to see how you appear to others. One of the most valuable things you can do is to videotape yourself during a meeting or even a casual conversation. When you sit down to watch it, fast-forward ten minutes; you’ll probably have forgotten about the camera enough to display uninhibited body language. Turn the sound off at first and just compare your body language (nodding, gesturing, etc.) to whomever is the most senior person in the room. Then watch again with the sound on and compare your verbal reassurance level with others’. Though the experience can be painful, it’s often invaluable: realize that everything you see on that tape is what others are seeing. You might as well be aware of it, too.*

*Be aware, however, that broadcasting too much power can come across as either arrogant or intimidating for some people. The warmth-enhancing techniques you gained earlier in this chapter, such as keeping your eyes in soft focus, will counter this. You can also aim to bring your chin down a few degrees—imagine a king bowing his head to a noble emissary. This has a double benefit. It avoids giving the impression that you’re contemptuously looking down your nose at someone (the impression given when your head is tilted back) and simultaneously makes you appear more thoughtful, attentive, and deliberate as your eyes automatically open wider.*  

- Page 164 (location ~ 2505-2510)    

*The same amount of nonverbal communication or reassurance can be appropriate and helpful in one context but hold you back in another. For instance, if you’re seeking to make a shy colleague or subordinate feel comfortable and open up, you would be smart to punctuate your interaction with both nonverbal (nodding) and verbal (uh-huh) reassurance. If they’re looking insecure and you think they need to be reassured, ramp up the amount of warmth you’re projecting. Use any of the warmth-enhancing visualizations you gained in Chapter 5 or the verbal warmth techniques from Chapter 8, and adapt your body language to theirs.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS While our words speak to a person’s logical mind, our nonverbal communication speaks to a person’s emotional mind. Nonverbal communication amplifies verbal communication when the two are congruent. When verbal and nonverbal messages contradict, we tend to trust what we see in the other person’s body language more than what we hear them say. Through emotional contagion, your emotions can spread to other people. As a leader, the emotions conveyed by your body language, even during brief, casual encounters, can have a ripple effect on your team or even your entire company. To communicate warmth, aim to make people feel comfortable: respect their personal space, mirror their body language, and keep your eyes relaxed. When people come to you in need of reassurance, first mirror their body language, then lead them to more calm, open, and confident positions. When people are defensive, break their body language lock by handing them something to look at or something they will have to lean forward to take. To project power, take up space (be the big gorilla) and be still (adopt a regal posture). Cut out verbal and nonverbal reassurances like head bobbing and excessive uh-huh-ing. 10*

*Divide and Conquer My first recommendation to Peter was simple: don’t try to win them all over all at once. Every time someone sees you, their perception of you is filtered through the context in which you both operate: their internal state and their personal and cultural filters. It’s far more difficult to have charisma when you’re dealing with a group because you must handle all the individual contexts on top of the group dynamic. The one exception is when you’re on stage: the effect of being in the spotlight makes up for the multiple-context handicap. But in general, when you have a group of difficult people to convince, you’ll have much greater chances of success if you work on each of them individually. This is why Peter and I crafted an individual persuasion strategy for the CEO of each country, and he had a separate meeting with each of them. This allowed him to choose the right charisma style for each person and situation. As we saw in Chapter 6, the “right” charisma style depends on your personality, the situation, your goals, and the person you’re dealing with. One situation*

*Benjamin Franklin’s favorite way to win over his political opponents was not to do them favors but rather to ask them for favors. Franklin once wrote a note to one of his adversaries expressing his hope of reading a certain rare book he’d heard that this gentleman possessed, and asking the favor of borrowing it for just a few days. The gentleman complied. Franklin returned it as promised, with a second note warmly expressing his appreciation and gratitude for the favor. In his autobiography, Franklin describes what happened as a result: “When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death.”1 This technique has become known as the Ben Franklin Effect. Having lent Franklin the book, the opponent had to either consider himself as inconsistent (having done a favor for someone he disliked) or rationalize his action by deciding that he actually rather liked Franklin. “I did something nice for this person, so I must like him. I wouldn’t have agreed to do a favor for someone I dislike. That wouldn’t make sense.” Using this technique encouraged the opponent to rationalize his actions in Franklin’s favor. How can you use this technique to your advantage? You could indeed ask your opponents for their help or ask them for a favor. Better still, ask them for something they can give without incurring any cost: their opinion. Asking for someone’s opinion is a better strategy than asking for their advice, because giving advice feels like more effort, as they have to tailor a recommendation to your situation, whereas with an opinion, they can just spout whatever is on their mind.*

*Way back in 1936, Dale Carnegie wrote the now-classic book How to Win Friends and Influence People. Though his original guidelines have since become clichés, some fundamental principles still hold; and in the case of praise, Carnegie’s writings are just as applicable today. He writes: “We all crave honest appreciation. It’s a gnawing and unfaltering human hunger; and the rare individual who satisfies it will hold people in the palm of his hand.” This simple recommendation is supported by recent science. People are indeed incredibly susceptible to praise. In fact, Keise Izuma’s research showed that hearing a computer tell people “Good job!” lit up the same reward regions of their brains as a financial windfall.*

*Reminding people that they had a choice and that they chose you, your company, your service, or your suggestion is one of the most useful tools to maintain their support for you or your idea, particularly when the going gets rough and people start complaining. And remember, this process also works in reverse, so avoid making other people feel wrong. If someone feels like they’ve done you harm, they will seek to rationalize their actions and will convince themselves that what they did was justified. They don’t want to feel like a bad person, therefore you must have done something wrong in order for them to act this way toward you. Few people will blame themselves no matter how*

*As with all toxic substances, toxic people should indeed be “handled with care.” Not for their sake, but for yours. Dealing with a difficult person, like any hostile situation, can activate your stress system, sending adrenaline flooding through your body. And that can be a killer. Dr. Redford Williams, professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center, spent more than twenty years studying the impact of the mind and emotions on health. “Getting angry is like taking a small dose of slow-acting poison,” he concluded. It leads to higher blood pressure and arterial damage, and it spurs cholesterol-filled fat cells to empty into the bloodstream. In brief, hostile feelings are apt to harm your health unless you know how to handle them. To counteract the stress hormones that could flood your system, impair your mental functioning, and generate negative body language, flood your system with oxytocin instead. To do this when dealing with a difficult person, get into empathy and stay there. You can use any of the compassion-accessing tools you learned in Chapter 5.*

It might also help to consider that this person may well be in a state of utter self-loathing. The internal world of difficult people can be pretty nasty—that’s the very reason they’re difficult. If their mental climate were one of peace and love, they’d be exuding warmth instead. Hostility is often nothing but the external manifestation of internal turmoil. If you need a compassion boost, consider an alternate reality. Imagine that just a few hours ago they saw a beloved parent die. Remember, it’s not for their sake that you’re doing this but for yours. It will reduce the level of toxicity in your body and make the experience less frustrating for you. You can go back to this technique anytime you feel your frustration level rising. Getting into empathy will protect your mental and emotional state, and give you the right body language throughout.*

*“They’re good people, but their behavior really got me angry. And because they didn’t apologize, the resentment just kept building.” She didn’t feel quite confident enough to demand an apology, but couldn’t let this resentment simmer either, because she needed to work well with both of her teammates. So Maria wrote a venting letter to get everything off her chest, describing in detail how she felt about the situation. Then she wrote out their imagined return apologies. “Writing the letter and receiving the apologies felt so liberating! I had a surprising feeling of satisfaction and could really feel the resentment dissipate.”*

*One summer afternoon, Xavier started our coaching session with a request. “There’s a voicemail I got a few hours ago that’s been really bugging me. Would you mind listening to it and helping me get into a better mental state before I return the call? It’s from Susan.” This is the message that Susan had left: “Xavier, I want to talk to you about your memo. I have bad news—well, I shouldn’t say that, but it’s something you may find insulting, and I guarantee I do not intend it that way. Anyway, call me back.” Ouch. Can you spot Susan’s mistakes? First, she was creating highly negative associations: her message was unpleasant from beginning to end. Second, she had fallen into the white-elephant trap by telling Xavier he “shouldn’t” feel insulted. Because our brain can’t unprocess information it has received, it’s likely that the word insulted is what Xavier’s mind recalled most. Third, by being vague in her message, Susan was letting Xavier’s mind imagine the worst. With a brain wired to look out for the negative, when we hear “It’s bad news,” our brain automatically starts thinking of the worst possible scenarios. Susan was also part of the team I was coaching, so when I saw her next I explained: “Put yourself in Xavier’s place. Imagine getting a voicemail announcing bad news and being insulted, without any explanation. Yes, you’ve certainly grabbed his attention. But what kind of emotions do you think he’ll associate with you from now on? Every time he thinks about that message he’ll think about bad news and being insulted. Is that really what you want to be associated with in Xavier’s mind?”*

*Do whatever you can to increase their comfort. You can even use props for this. Have you ever noticed the way that people fidget with items in their hands or with their clothing—for instance, toying with their shirt buttons when they’re in the middle of a difficult conversation or when they’re having trouble expressing themselves? What they’re subconsciously doing is finding objects on which to focus their mind to distract themselves from the discomfort of their immediate experience. Make it easy for them by having objects close by with which they can play, and thus more quickly feel at ease, while conversing with you. They won’t even realize what’s happening, and yet they’ll sense the interaction become easier and more comfortable.*  

- Page 175 (location ~ 2671-2676)    

*When you’re delivering unpleasant news of any kind, your body language is everything. Remember the way negative performance reviews delivered with positive body language were far better received than positive reviews delivered with negative body language? In stressful situations, your body language carries far greater impact than your words. When the stress system is activated, a more primal part of the brain takes over, which does not directly comprehend words or ideas. Instead, it’s immediately impacted by body language.*  

- Page 175 (location ~ 2682-2685)    

*The right body language for delivering bad news is one of warmth: care, concern, understanding, and empathy. Essentially, demonstrate as much kindness charisma as you can. The worse the news, the more important it is for the recipient to feel that you truly understand them, and that you are there with them. This is where the internal tools of goodwill, compassion, and empathy come in. First, get yourself into the right internal state. Access compassion so that it plays out across your body language. Put yourself in their shoes; imagine in vivid detail what it’s like inside their head, inside their life. Imagine both of you with angel wings working toward a common mission. Focus on a compassionate phrase, such as “Just love as much as you can from wherever you are.” Try to convey empathy in your facial expressions, your tone of voice, and your words.*  

- Page 176 (location ~ 2685-2693)    

*There are four crucial steps to charismatically delivering criticism. First, think about your timing and the location. Try to be as empathetic as possible in your choice of both. Consider the individual’s levels of stress and fatigue. With criticism (or with “constructive feedback”), try to provide it as soon as possible after witnessing the behavior you want to change. Just be sure the person is in a physically and emotionally receptive state when you do so. Second, get into the right mindset, one of compassion and empathy. Yes, even when delivering criticism, your compassion will play out across your body language and affect the entire interaction in a positive way. Warmth is also important here. Accessing kindness or focus charisma will ease the situation, whereas authority charisma would worsen it. When people feel that you have their best interests at heart, it can change the dynamic entirely. Chris, an executive from Los Angeles, told me about a former boss who he felt was truly invested in his success. This boss, when pointing out areas of improvement, would remind Chris that he wanted him to be promoted as soon as possible and that’s why he was pointing out the things that needed to be better. To access the right mental state, you can also try thinking of a person whom you highly respect just before you deliver criticism. You might think of a favorite grandparent, mentor, spiritual figure, or anyone who is important to you. If you were to make this comment to them, or in front of them, how would you word your criticism? In what ways do you see your comments changing now? Try to remind yourself of this regularly throughout the difficult conversation and imagine the respected mentor watching you.*  

- Page 177 (location ~ 2708-2720)    

*Third, decide exactly what points you want to make: be specific. Focusing on a few key points rather than making an exhaustive list will prevent the other person from feeling overwhelmed. In addition, if your criticism is too general, their danger-wary brain might imagine the worst possible interpretations of your message. Fourth, depersonalize. As much as possible, communicate that what you’re critiquing is the behavior, not the person. It’s harder to find common ground when someone feels that their intentions or character traits have been criticized. Be very wary of assuming you’ve accurately guessed a person’s motives. Instead, focus on observed behaviors and verified facts. Even when focusing on the behavior, aim to make the criticism as impersonal as possible. The wrong way to do this would be to say: “Why do you always procrastinate on presentations until the very last minute?” This is both personal and generalized. Instead, zero in on one observed behavior: “When you wait until the very last minute to prepare the presentation, I feel anxious.” After all, we create the feelings of anxiety in our bodies—it’s our decision to become upset. If possible, don’t mention their actions at all. Just explain what’s going on for you: “When I don’t see a finished presentation until the last minute, I feel anxious.”*  

- Page 178 (location ~ 2721-2730)    

*If you start your criticism with a positive beginning, it will affect the rest of the experience. In the first moments, when people are most apprehensive, what they need is reassurance. You can give them solid ground to stand on by expressing the fact that you value them—that you recognize their worth as human beings, and that they matter to you as colleagues, as clients. Once they are reassured of their own worth, people will accept your comments far more easily, and they’ll get less defensive. Indeed, this step may be the most important one to mitigate a defensive reaction. Defensiveness, after all, is often just the outward face of fear and insecurity. Let’s say a colleague has been falling behind on his commitments. Instead of pointing to this fact directly, first acknowledge his many positive contributions. This way, he will feel that his entire history is fairly recognized. It also recognizes the behavior as momentary, a lapse in otherwise good behavior.*  

- Page 179 (location ~ 2738-2745)    

*Just as when dealing with a difficult person, try to avoid making people feel wrong when you’re delivering criticism. When someone is told they’re wrong, even when they do realize they’re at fault, they will often strive to justify themselves; it can both wound their ego and arouse their resentment, leading them to discredit you in an attempt to lessen their own guilt. Legendary diplomat Benjamin Franklin admitted in his memoirs to learning this lesson the hard way. As a young man, having found one of his adversaries in error, he felt quite right in pointing out the error, proving beyond the shadow of a doubt that the man had erred. He made his point—and he made an enemy for life. Franklin came to realize that the short-lived pleasure of being right was not worth the long-term negative consequences. From then on, he adopted the practice of “denying [himself] the pleasure of contradicting others.” He would instead begin by observing that “in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appeared to be some difference.” You can take a similar path by saying: “You know, I might not be explaining this the right way. Let me try again.” Choose the high road. Being a charismatic communicator means that others feel good about themselves when they are with you. It means that others look forward to being with you because they like themselves better as a result of being around you.*

So use all the tools in your arsenal to stay in an internal state of calm and goodwill. Your body language will follow.*  

- Page 180 (location ~ 2752-2764)    

*When closing the conversation, if you can, aim to end on a positive note. Remember how important beginnings and endings are—they can color the whole interaction. This is when you can put the emphasis on three important points: Next steps: Review the steps that will be taken to improve the situation, particularly if you’re going to do any of it together. Give the sense of constructive, forward motion. Appreciation: Tell them how much you appreciate how well they took your feedback. Praise even the slightest good effort here; you’re providing positive reinforcement so they’ll improve over time. A positive future: Bring up anything that both of you can look forward to in the future, such as exciting events or upcoming projects—whatever conveys the fact that you’re looking forward to future interactions.*  

- Page 181 (location ~ 2771-2777)    

*One of my very first clients told me that he actually welcomed making minor mistakes, especially early on in a business relationship. “Most people do such a piss-poor job of apologizing that just by being halfway decent at it, you’ll be head and shoulders above the rest.” Another entrepreneur told me: “I have a pretty good track record of turning screw-ups into up-sells.” So let’s see how you can approach, conduct, and conclude apologies charismatically. First, as always, get into the right mental state. This means, first and foremost, forgiving yourself. Yes, I’m serious. Though it may sound counterintuitive, having warmth toward yourself—even though you may be at fault—is necessary to prevent making the situation worse through negative body language. It will greatly help avoid any sign of defensiveness in either your voice, your posture, or any part of your facial expression. So use all the tools we’ve covered to access and stay in a state of self-compassion. Forgiving yourself and getting into a good mental state also helps you avoid appearing overly apologetic, subservient, or insecure. With the confidence that accompanies a positive internal state you can embody both warmth and contrition, yet still be seen as coming from a place of strength.*  

- Page 182 (location ~ 2784-2793)    

*Because so much of our communication is nonverbal, when you apologize in person you have the greatest number of tools at your disposal: body language, facial expressions, and vocal tone, in addition to your choice of words. On the phone, you have only your voice and words to work with, and you have even fewer instruments at your disposal in an e-mail. On the other hand, some people find it easier to handle such difficult situations with the distance that a written medium provides. Written communication has the advantage that you can put hours of thinking into a few lines of communication, and really get them right. Putting something in writing can also be a powerful statement. You are in a sense making it permanent; you are willing to be held to account. In this case, as with so many of the charisma-enhancing techniques, it will be a question of what is the best fit considering your preferences, your best guess of their preferences, and what the logistics, timing, and context allow.*  

- Page 183 (location ~ 2795-2803)    

*Use any of the internal tools we’ve covered to inject warmth into the interaction, and call on your kindness charisma. Think of keeping your chin down, your eyes wide open, and your voice warm and slow, leaving frequent pauses to make room for the other person to jump in should they feel the urge to do so. Once you’re sure that you fully understand the complaint, and if you agree that the fault was yours, a true-blue apology is in order. Surprisingly, your wording can be very simple (again, body language is what really matters). A simple “I’m very sorry” delivered with full presence and full warmth can work wonders. What matters is the thoughtfulness, concern, and sense of personal involvement that you convey. There is, for instance, a significant difference between saying “I’m sorry” rather than just “Sorry.” The first shows that you, personally, identify with and feel touched by the situation they’re in. Sincerity is key: you need to sound as if you really mean it, rather than just apologizing to calm them down.*  

- Page 184 (location ~ 2815-2823)    

*To communicate presence, Michael Feuer, the founder of OfficeMax, says that he often closes his eyes when listening. I was struck by how good a listener he was: even on the phone, I could feel the intensity of his listening, how well he absorbed everything I was saying. For best results, get up from your desk and away from all distractions. Stay standing and walk around (your voice will sound more energetic) while focusing entirely on the phone call. Just as actors do when they lend their voices to puppets, use the same body language techniques as you would in person. As actors know, this will greatly enhance your voice. Remember the smile studies that showed that listeners could identify sixteen different types of smiles based on sound alone. Listen to what the other person is saying and what’s going on in the background. If you hear the other phone line ring, ask if he needs to answer it, and assure him that it’s all right with you. He’ll appreciate it, and you don’t want his brain split between vaguely listening to you and trying to figure out whom the other caller may be.*

*Here’s one specific—and surprisingly effective—recommendation for phone charisma, courtesy of author Leil Lowndes: Do not answer the phone in a warm or friendly manner. Instead, answer crisply and professionally. Then, only after you hear who is calling, let warmth or even enthusiasm pour forth in your voice. This simple technique is an easy and effective way to make people feel special. I recommend it to all my business clients whose companies have a strong customer service component. The gains in customer satisfaction are impressive. When writing e-mails, you can apply all the tools and principles you’ve learned in the past sections. Review a few of your past e-mail messages. How often does the word I appear, as opposed to the word you? Does the e-mail speak about you and your interests first? Don’t try to fight your natural tendency (we’re hardwired to primarily care about ourselves, after all). Instead, write out the e-mail as you normally would, but before you send it, simply cut and paste so that whatever pertains to the other person appears first and most prominently. You can also do this with your marketing materials, whether it be your Web site, brochures, or anything that represents you or your company to the world. When consulting to large firms I often recommend that they go through their marketing materials (you can do the same with your e-mails) using two different-colored highlighters, one for things relating to them and the other for sentences that speak to their potential clients. If the second color doesn’t predominate, they have a problem.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Approach difficult people individually and choose the right charisma style for each person and each situation. Express appreciation for their help or positive impact: it’ll make them rationalize their actions in your favor. When delivering bad news, get into a state of compassion, and show warmth and care in your timing, body language, and verbal language. When delivering criticism, get into a state of goodwill, and focus the request for change on specific behaviors rather than on personal traits. When delivering apologies, show presence in hearing them out completely, show warmth in your apology, and show power in how you’ll correct the mistake or prevent its reoccurrence. With phone and e-mail communication, use all the tools you’ve learned for in-person communication.*

*Let’s say you’re giving a presentation at four P.M. on a Wednesday afternoon. Your audience has been thinking, acting, interacting, and dealing with issues since they woke up that morning. Whatever has been occupying their minds since then doesn’t magically vanish when they enter the room to attend your presentation. It all stays in their heads, and you may have to compete with it for their attention. Select the single most important idea you want to convey and make it as crystal clear and easy to understand as you possibly can. Ideally, you should be able to articulate your message in one sentence. Within this one main message, have three to five key supporting points. The human brain thinks in triads (from Olympic medals to fairy tales, it’s three medals, three princes, three bears), and it cannot immediately comprehend numbers greater than four.* Each one of your supporting points should open with entertaining anecdotes, fascinating facts, compelling statistics, great metaphors, examples, and analogies. Stories have a particularly strong impact on people. In fact, audiences will often remember first the story, and only second the point the story was making. Since the dawn of time, people have been telling stories as a way to transmit information to one another.*  

- Page 190 (location ~ 2899-2909)    

*Using metaphors and analogies can be a highly effective way of capturing your audience’s imagination. For maximum impact, choose images and analogies that would appeal to a young audience. The speeches that give us a feeling of awe and wonder are those that appeal to our childhood roots. If you’re mentioning the fact that there is untapped potential in your customer base, liken yourselves to “bounty hunters” or “treasure hunters” searching for “hidden gold.”*  

- Page 190 (location ~ 2913-2916)    

*Make even numbers and statistics personal, meaningful, and relatable for your audience. Steve Jobs did this masterfully when he gave his audience two ways of measuring iPhone sales: “Apple sold four million iPhones so far,” he said. “That amounts to selling twenty thousand iPhones every single day.” He did even better with memory cards: “This memory card has twelve gigabytes of memory. That means it holds enough music for you to travel to the moon and back.”*  

- Page 191 (location ~ 2916-2920)    

*When you craft the closing of your presentation, keep in mind that we remember primarily beginnings and endings. Just as you want to start on a high note, you also want to end on a high note, so avoid ending with Q&A. It’s hard to have a question-and-answer period as compelling and energetic as your main speech. Almost inevitably, the Q&A period lowers the energy. Personally, I avoid formal Q&A entirely. Instead, my introducer warns the audience that there will be no Q&A session at the end, so their one and only chance to ask questions is during the speech. This has the added advantage of increasing the audience’s involvement, participation, and general energy level.*  

- Page 191 (location ~ 2922-2927)    

*You’re going to be in the spotlight, so think carefully about the message you want to convey through your clothing. Is it authority? Power? Warmth? Keep in mind what social psychologists’ research reveals about chromatic effects:2 Red conveys energy, passion. Wear red to wake up an audience. Black shows you’re serious and that you won’t take no for an answer. White exudes honesty and innocence, which is why defendants often choose it in the courtroom. Blue emits trust. The darker the shade, the deeper the level of trust it elicits. Gray is a good neutral, the quintessential color of business. Orange and yellow are not recommended. Because they are the first to attract the human eye, they are also the first to tire it.*  

- Page 192 (location ~ 2935-2943)    

*Charisma takes practice. Steve Jobs, who appeared so masterful on stage, was known to rehearse important presentations relentlessly. Just as a duck appears to be sailing smoothly on the surface of a lake while powerfully paddling below the waterline, it takes a whole lot of effort for a presentation to appear effortless. When a speech is important I practice until every breath is perfect, because knowing I’ve got the speech so well mastered allows me to be spontaneous. I know that I have muscle memory to fall back on. When you know that a particular presentation will have a significant impact on your career, it’s worth rehearsing until you feel that it’s part of your very bones. One interesting technique used by magicians is to run through the entire presentation once with their eyes closed. Another good practice is to have your speech audiotaped or, better yet, videotaped, and to count what professional speakers call irritants. These are any sounds or movements that do not add to your message. Because the audience is watching your every move, every sound and facial expression you make is a form of communication that demands a portion of their attention. Be strategic: make sure you’re getting value out of each nonverbal gesture you make, and limit superfluous gestures to avoid wasting any bit of your audience’s attention.*  

- Page 193 (location ~ 2954-2963)    

*Charismatic speakers know how to give the impression that they’re as comfortable walking across the stage as they would be walking across their living room. This is called owning the stage, and there are three tricks to making it happen. First, when you stand, be sure to have a wide stance, well balanced on both feet. Not only will you feel more confident, you’ll also look more confident, more stable, than if you were standing on one foot. Wide, stable stances also help you to project confidence. Be the gorilla! Second, practice without a podium or a lectern. Speaking behind one can give the impression that you’re fearful to venture out, and prefer staying behind the safety of a shield. It also makes the presentation much more static. Think of the stereotype of a boring presentation: a lecturer who stands immobile at his lectern, reading from his notes in a monotone voice. Moving comfortably around the stage will make you appear much more confident, powerful, and charismatic. Third, find the right volume to project confidence. This is tricky, as so much can depend on the microphone you’re given that day or how the sound system is set up. Your best bet is, just before the speech, to ask a few people sitting in the back of the room to be your sound experts and give you a prearranged signal to raise or lower your volume if need be.*

*For the next five years, every speech outline I prepared was emblazoned with one bold word scrawled across the top of every page: BREATHE! Today, when learning a new speech, I’ll often still include notes to myself every few pages: Pause. Breathe. Slow Down. Though this may feel unnecessary in the comfort of home or office, things are very different on stage. In the heat of the moment, with adrenaline flowing through your veins, your brain speeds up. This is why everything around you can seem to be happening in slow motion. With your brain going on hyperdrive, you’ll also tend to speak faster. But your audience is still operating at normal speed. In addition to practicing, it can be helpful to ask a member of the audience to give you a prearranged signal reminding you to slow down. It’s really worth paying attention to your tempo because the slower you speak, the more thoughtful and deliberate you will sound, and the more attention people will give to what you say. During that first speech, I felt certain that if I were to pause even for an instant, I’d lose my audience’s attention forever. It takes courage to pause. But, just as in conversations, pausing regularly during your presentations is an important skill to acquire. It’s one of the hallmarks of effective speakers and really is one of the key tools for great speaking. Throughout your speech, pause frequently, deliberately. Have the confidence to make your listeners wait for your words. It’s called a dramatic pause for a reason: it adds drama.*  

- Page 197 (location ~ 3010-3021)    

*On the other hand, when done right, the audience is so spellbound that often not a single person stirs for a full minute.” After your last words, pause, then say “Thank you” and stay there while you endure the applause for a few seconds. If you’re having trouble pausing, try color-coding your speeches. I used this technique for years when I first started out. I would use one blue bar for a one-beat pause, two red bars for a two-beat pause (having the difference both in color and in markings helps in the heat of the moment, when your mind is racing and you can’t think clearly). I would also underline any part that needed warmth, to indicate that I should smile. Yes, it really worked—people actually told me I seemed wonderfully at ease, fluid, spontaneous, and natural. You can try out a lot of these tips in low-stakes situations, for instance, during a parent-teacher association, service club, or homeowners’ meeting. Let’s say you’re at your next PTA meeting. You’ve always thought it would be nice if the school’s fading hallway could be repainted. You’re going to get a few minutes to present your case, and you need to keep everyone focused on what you’re going to say. Since this issue is really not a big deal for you one way or the other, this would be a good time to try out the techniques you’ve just learned: voice fluctuation, strategic pauses, and intonation drops to make your message compelling.*  

- Page 198 (location ~ 3028-3038)    

*Check your body. Make sure that no tense posture is worsening your internal state. <U+2666> Take a deep breath and relax your body. <U+2666> Destigmatize and dedramatize. Remember that this happens to everyone, and it will pass. <U+2666> If any negative thoughts are present, remember that they’re just thoughts, and not necessarily valid. <U+2666> Find little things to be grateful for: your ability to breathe, the fact that you will still be alive by the end of this. <U+2666> Imagine getting a great hug from someone you trust for twenty seconds (of course, you may not have twenty seconds, but if you do, this is remarkably effective). Once your threat response is quieted down, to bring yourself back into a state of confidence remember a moment in your life when you felt absolute triumph. Thanks to your brain’s inability to distinguish imagination from reality, your body will be filled with the same cocktail of chemicals (yes, we’re helping you play chemist with your brain) as it was during that confidence-filled moment, thereby changing your body language into exactly what you need to be impressive, persuasive, and inspiring again.*

*Arrive early if you can; walk the stage to visualize and own the stage. <U+2666> Go into a quiet room nearby, and use internal tools such as visualization to get into a state of confidence and warmth. <U+2666> Pause before you start. Count three beats, facing the audience, before you begin to speak. <U+2666> During the presentation, expect things to go wrong—whether an external disruption or your flubbing something. <U+2666> Use the midcourse corrections tools you’ve just learned. Take it with humanity and invite the audience into this mistake as a shared joke. <U+2666> Throughout your speech, remember to pause, breathe, and slow down. <U+2666> Don’t run off stage; pause after your last words.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Your presentation should have one main, simple, crystal-clear message, supported by three to five key points. Support each point with an entertaining story, interesting statistic, concrete example, or vivid metaphor. Make your presentation short and entertaining. Watch the value of each sentence. Arrive early if you can; walk the stage to visualize and own it. Use a wide, well-balanced stance and take up as much space as possible on stage. Limit superfluous gestures that distract the audience’s attention. Speak as if you’re sharing a secret with the audience, telling them something special and confidential. Use smiles and fluctuation to warm your voice. Keep eye contact for one to two seconds per person. Pause frequently and deliberately to show confidence and add drama as well as give yourself a chance to breathe.*

*If you find yourself in a crisis, it’s actually an opportunity to gain charisma—if you play your cards right. This chapter will show you how. First, retain at least a certain measure of equanimity. Most charismatic leaders are known for their ability to remain (or appear) calm even in the midst of turbulent circumstances. As you know, anxiety impacts how you feel, how you perform, and how others perceive you and react to you. It’s often immediately visible in your body language. As a leader, your body language already has a ripple effect through the company in normal times. This effect is only magnified in times of crisis, because crises put leaders in the spotlight, with people anxiously watching their every move. Stress systems go on constant, low-grade alert; primal brains take over, leading people to react to your body language far more than to your words.*  

- Page 203 (location ~ 3105-3112)    

*To keep cool, use all the internal tools—this is where they really shine. I particularly recommend the following techniques: Check your physiology often, both for your own sake (it affects your psychology) and for that of others (it will be “caught” by them and will spread). Skillfully handle internal negativity: destigmatize, dedramatize, and neutralize the negative perceptions that may be crowding your mind. Rewrite reality to whatever degree is helpful. To get out of a pessimistic state, find a few different ways of viewing the situation positively. Use visualizations to keep yourself in the right state. For instance, a responsibility transfer could be useful for reducing anxiety.*  

- Page 204 (location ~ 3113-3119)    

*Second, express high expectations. Sometimes, simply assigning to people the labels you want them to live up to is enough. After hearing that they were considered charitable, New Haven housewives gave far more money to a canvasser from the Multiple Sclerosis Association than they ever had before.2 The mere knowledge that they were viewed as charitable caused these women to make their actions consistent with others’ perception of them.*  

- Page 204 (location ~ 3122-3125)    

*Think of the people you want your charisma to impact. What standard would you like them to live up to or exceed? Express this expectation as if you have full confidence that they can live up to it. Better yet, act like you assume they already are meeting these standards. Third, articulate a vision. A charismatic vision is what will give your charisma staying power when the crisis is over. Think of Nelson Mandela, whose vision of unity and modernism for South Africa was so powerful that even after the crisis of apartheid had passed and his service as president was over, he continued to be seen as a transnational leader for all of southern Africa and an influential voice in international politics. On the other hand, President George H. W. Bush, who had enjoyed 90 percent approval ratings during the Gulf War, was voted out of office the very next year. His charisma had soared during the crisis, but he had (in his own words) neglected “the vision thing.”*  

- Page 204 (location ~ 3128-3135)    

*Once you have expressed your vision, be bold and decisive. By the winter of 1815, Napoleon, defeated and humiliated by the French Royal Army, had been condemned to a life of exile on the island of Elba. The man who had risen from humble beginnings to lead the French army and crown himself emperor of France was now alive only because his attempt at suicide failed. In the last few days of February, he escaped the island and landed on the shores of France with nothing. He had neither power nor money, and had last been seen in a humiliating defeat. And yet the sheer force of his visionary charisma drew people to him once again. He conveyed complete confidence in his ability to sweep through the country and regain power. He gave people a compelling vision of a country free from the long-hated ruling class. He had nothing but a vision and charisma, yet that was enough. The unthinkable was happening: with no money to pay soldiers’ wages, without even enough food to feed them, Napoleon was somehow gathering troops and proclaiming his intention to reclaim the throne. The French court was incensed. Marshal Ney was asked to lead the charge to quash the ruffian once and for all. On the day of his departure, Ney made a public commitment to the whole court that he would “bring back the usurper in a cage.” He then set off from Paris, marching at the head of the royal armies even as Napoleon was leading his much smaller band of men to meet him.*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Charisma is particularly effective in crisis situations. Stay in a calm, confident internal state so that your emotional contagion effect is positive. Express high expectations of people, and communicate your complete confidence in their ability to rise to the occasion. Articulate a bold vision, show your confidence in your ability to realize that vision, and act decisively to achieve it.*  

- Page 206 (location ~ 3159-3164)    

*As you become increasingly magnetic, you may find yourself attracting praise, admiration, and envy. When the team succeeds, credit will naturally flow to you. It’s your name the higher-ups remember, your contribution, and your face they put on the success. And that’s all great. Until, that is, others start resenting you for it. At best, their envy will make them feel alienated. At worst, they will try to sabotage you. You’re going to have to compensate for your charisma in order to limit the jealousy and resentment others may feel. You have three choices: you can refuse the glory, reflect the glory, or transfer the glory. Refusing the glory means trying to self-efface—to minimize the praise you’re getting. You can try to bring yourself back down through self-deprecation, downplaying compliments and praise. But we’ve seen how this can backfire, as you’re essentially contradicting your admirers and making them feel wrong. Reflecting the glory means highlighting others’ contributions. This works well, and has the additional bonus of making you look modest. Something as simple as “Thanks! We were really lucky to have Susan checking the financials and Bill doing his graphic magic.” But sometimes, no matter how much you reflect, some people will still become envious or resentful of your magnetism and your success. You may need to go a step further, which is to transfer the glory.*  

- Page 207 (location ~ 3173-3183)    

*Giving people a sense of ownership for your success is a great way to prevent resentment and engender good feelings, such as pride and loyalty, instead. This technique is, in fact, known as a Clinton classic. During his tenure in the White House, Bill Clinton was known to go around asking everyone, from his chef to his janitor, for their opinion on foreign policy. He’d listen intently, and in subsequent conversations would refer back to the opinion they’d offered. When people feel that they’ve had a hand in “making” you, they feel a certain ownership of and identification with you, and therefore a certain responsibility for your success. As you become increasingly successful and visible, it might be worth regularly launching a brief envy-prevention campaign. Warning: you must be sincere in whatever it is you choose to say. One of my clients, when learning the following sequence, exclaimed: “Great! A shortcut! From now on, I can give people the feeling I care about them without actually liking them in the least, right?” Wrong. First, as you now know, the vast majority of the time, if you don’t mean what you say, people will intuitively know. They’ll feel it on a gut level. Second, expressing something we don’t believe leads to cognitive dissonance, which uses up our focus, diverts our attention, and thus impairs our performance. Insincerity just isn’t worth the toll it takes.*  

- Page 209 (location ~ 3202-3212)    

*Justification. Create an excuse for contacting the person; it can’t seem completely out of the blue: “I was talking to Sue and your name came up” or “Bob made me think of you and that time when…” When I’m coaching clients, I tell them to use our session as a justification. After all, I have indeed asked them to think of the people who matter to their career, so they can truthfully say, “I was working with my executive coach, and your name came up.”*  

- Page 210 (location ~ 3213-3216)    

*With this said, think of a dozen people who could matter to your career. Then reach out to them by phone or e-mail with the following envy-prevention technique: Justification. Create an excuse for contacting the person; it can’t seem completely out of the blue: “I was talking to Sue and your name came up” or “Bob made me think of you and that time when…” When I’m coaching clients, I tell them to use our session as a justification. After all, I have indeed asked them to think of the people who matter to their career, so they can truthfully say, “I was working with my executive coach, and your name came up.” Appreciation. Thank the person for what they’ve done for you. You can thank someone for taking time to meet you, whether in person or by phone, especially if you spoke with them for the first time or for a long time. You can also acknowledge good advice or interesting information someone gave you. Lay it all out. Demonstrate exactly how the person helped you. Acknowledge their effort: “I know you didn’t have to do…” or “I know you went out of your way to do…” Impact. Let them know the positive impact they’ve had on you. What did they do or say or what example did they set that changed you for the better? What do you do or say differently because of what they did or said or because of the example they set for you? How is your life or your behavior different? Tell them the difference it made to you personally; make it dramatic. People love to feel important. Responsibility. The Justification-Appreciation-Laying-out-the-Impact sequence creates a feeling of Responsibility (JALIR). It gives people a feeling of vested interest in your success. Give them as much credit as you can. Make them feel that they own your success and they will feel driven to help you continue to succeed.*  

- Page 210 (location ~ 3212-3226)    

*Here’s a JALIR e-mail that a client of mine recently sent out: Dan— I was just thinking about you the other day when someone asked me who were the people who’d had an impact on my career. I don’t know if I ever mentioned how much I learned from working with you on the finance project. I’ll always remember the way you handled that one hostile phone call—how calm you remained throughout. It taught me one could stay even-keeled no matter what the client was saying. These days, when I feel I’m losing patience on a call, I often remind myself, “Hey, remember how Dan handled that hostile call?” Oh, and the advice you gave me on strategic pricing? I’ve been following it ever since. In fact, it played a key role in the success of the department’s largest proposal this year. All in all, I guess I just want to say thanks. Though you may not realize it, you had a big impact on me, so please take some credit for whatever success you see me have! Best, Jim*

*“Never take people deeper than they’re ready to go. It’s your job to not give in to the high, to not let them reveal more than they’re ready for.” Over the years I’ve realized that this feeling of a safe cocoon can have other side effects. Sometimes, without realizing it, as people feel so safe and strong, they’ll venture too close to their own demons, ones that they’re not ready to face. This challenge is one of the few downsides that can accompany kindness or focus charisma. I remember one extraordinary session where I led my client from epiphany to epiphany. Oh, it was a high. He saw so much of his potential, so much of himself, he told me the scales had fallen from his eyes. He said he felt lifted, renewed, and reborn. I thought this was quite a triumph, gave him a few guidelines, and sent him on his way.*  

- Page 213 (location ~ 3258-3264)    

*In the years since, under the guidance of wiser mentors, I’ve learned not to give in to the magical feeling that charisma can create and to put the brakes on so that my clients’ comfort builds gradually, over a number of sessions. It’s not easy, however, to slow people down when they’re in the middle of this kind of experience without leaving them feeling hurt and rejected. Here are a few “soft landing” approaches to try: Pay attention. When they start sharing, ask yourself: Will they regret having said this tomorrow? As soon as you hear them start to say something you think they may regret, interject a “me, too” story. This is the one case where interruption is warranted. Ideally, this would be something you’ve personally experienced, second best would be something that someone close to you has experienced, and third best would be something you’ve heard about. The “me, too” interjection accomplishes three things: First, this forces them to pause, interrupts their flow, and gives them a chance to slow down the stream of personal revelations. Second, they get to hear something similar to what they’ve just shared told by someone else, and with this switching of roles, a chance to hear how revelatory their own sharing was. They can then decide whether they feel comfortable continuing on that path. Last, this will help them when they come off the high. If their ego recoils in shame over having shared too much, they can cling to the fact that the person they shared so much with revealed something similar. If it’s too late and they’ve already gone too far, show them that you are placing their revelations in the whole-scope context of all you know about them—that whatever they are revealing is just one piece of a much bigger picture that contains many elements they can be proud of. Say something like, “Wow, I never would have guessed you had such a strong impostor syndrome, too, considering all your accomplishments.” You can also aim to make them feel admired for having shared and revealed so much. Remember, what you’re trying to counteract is shame, and few things work better for this than admiration. For example: “You’re showing some serious courage to be delving so deep. That’s impressive.”*

*Celebrities and CEOs have at least one thing in common: they’re always on display. Whether they know it or not, whether they like it or not, they’re almost always under scrutiny. This is another possible side effect of high-power charisma styles such as authority and visionary. Business book author Marshall Goldsmith told me that many CEOs worry about the pressure to always be on their best behavior. “For them, it’s always ‘showtime.’ They have to demonstrate charisma even when listening to the most tedious PowerPoint presentation, because everyone in the room is looking at them, as well as (or even more than) at the presenter.” Because charismatic people seem endowed with extra powers, we expect more of them than we do of others. We expect greater results and will not be content, much less impressed, with good but not extraordinary performance.*

*J. R. Wurster, the CEO of a small Los Angeles–based film company, gives off such a laid-back vibe that he’s the last person I’d have expected to feel pressured by the spotlight. And yet when I mentioned this issue, he knew exactly what I meant: “This pressure to always overperform can really burn out charismatic people. We no longer allow ourselves to be human, and no one can live like that.” The answer? Allow yourself to be human. This means both accepting humanity and showing your humanity. Which means both accepting vulnerability and (gasp!) showing vulnerability. I know, I know, even just considering this may feel highly uncomfortable. And yet I promise it’s worth it. Hayes Barnard (the charismatic CEO of Paramount Equity) told me that “executives who are very transparent and vulnerable are very charismatic.” Remember Frank Sinatra and Sam Walton playing up their flaws before facing an audience.*

The idea that drawing attention to your vulnerabilities would ultimately enhance your power may seem counterintuitive. But showing vulnerability and humanity makes you more relatable and helps to avoid the feeling of alienation, which is a real risk when your charisma gives you a touch of the superhuman. If Superman didn’t have the foibles of Clark Kent to humanize him, he would be much less likable. It would be impossible to relate to him.*  

- Page 216 (location ~ 3306-3315)    

*Putting It into Practice: Showing Vulnerability Think of the next three or four conversations you’re going to have. Pick one or two that have low stakes. Now find a small vulnerability you could share. This should not be something major. Any minor fear, hesitation, concern, or regret will do. You might share something you’re worried about, something you think you did wrong, or something you wish you could have done better. Before the conversation, do a compassion visualization and a responsibility transfer for the outcome of this exercise. This gets your body language right and prevents anxiety from overwhelming you, though you should expect discomfort—that’s what vulnerability is all about. During the conversation, here are a few good ways to ease into the sharing: <U+2666> “You know, I have to tell you…” or “I have to admit…” are good preambles. <U+2666> Prepare the terrain by saying “I’m feeling a bit nervous about saying this, but…” <U+2666> You can also ask them to keep this conversation confidential. Not only will this make you feel safer, it will make people treasure the moment more. People love secrets. Do another quick responsibility transfer immediately after revealing the vulnerability. This helps your brain get comfortable with expressing vulnerabilities by linking to the process the good feelings that a transfer of responsibility often brings. As with the advanced delving into discomfort exercise, vulnerability can be highly uncomfortable. But you now have all the tools you need to handle this discomfort, and it’s worth doing, because you’ll gain a wonderful skill. You may notice already how very “alive” vulnerability can make you feel. It can also make you feel very connected to others. If you want to refine your practice of vulnerability, pay attention to the following: it’s not just what you say and what you share but also how you feel while you’re sharing. Some people manage to disclose highly personal, intimate, vulnerable information but don’t feel a thing while doing so. It’s as if they keep themselves at a distance from the vulnerability. They lay out the facts as they would a math problem and they keep their hearts well shielded behind a wall. As your skills increase, try actually feeling a little vulnerability when you share a small disclosure. If you can manage this, your body language will be much more effective. A small dose of vulnerability is all you need to project it successfully, and the self-compassion tools from Chapter 5 will make the overall experience much easier.*

*For Arthur, charisma’s greatest danger is that it gives you the power to convince people even when you’re completely wrong. “I’ve realized that as long as I’m convinced that I’m right, and strongly care about it, I can convince people of anything. And I am no more likely to be right than they are, frankly. It’s just that when I combine logical arguments with emotion, passion, and charisma, it suddenly just feels right for everyone to do what I say.” Arthur told me that he’s learned to consciously restrain his charisma when he’s with his own team. He tries to set up guardrails to prevent it from overpowering worthwhile arguments. As he told me, “I’ve been noticing how convincing I sound, how objective and fair I appear, when in reality, as I realize later, I was neither. With great power comes great responsibility. I second-guess my decisions now much more than I used to.” As you become increasingly charismatic and things start happening easily for you, there’s also a risk of assuming that things happen just as easily and smoothly for other people. Try to remember that this isn’t the case; others don’t all have your new charismatic powers.*

*Warning: Charisma Is a Power Tool; Use It Responsibly People often ask me whether the techniques they’re learning could have dangerous consequences. And of course they could—this stuff is powerful. There is indeed a dark side. Many of those who have studied charisma closely have come to warn against it. Until the 1980s, in fact, many highly influential leadership thinkers, such as Peter Drucker, vehemently opposed both the study and the teaching of charisma. Drucker frequently pointed out that the most charismatic leaders of the last century were Hitler, Stalin, Mao, and Mussolini. Charisma is powerful because it increases one’s ability to influence others. Any training that heightens this ability has the potential of being used in both helpful and harmful ways. In its aim, charisma training is no different from any other leadership skills training. Should we, then, discourage all training in leadership effectiveness? Marshall Goldsmith told me that he sees charisma as an asset like any other, just like intelligence: “If you’re going in the right direction, you’ll get there faster. In the wrong direction, charisma will also help you get there faster. It’s an asset, not an insurance policy. Do many charismatic leaders fail? Of course they do. Just like many very intelligent leaders. That doesn’t mean that either charisma or intelligence is wrong.”*

*KEY TAKEAWAYS Charisma has a few possible downsides: you can become the target of envy and resentment, others can reveal too much during your interactions, you are held to a higher standard, it can be lonely at the top, and charisma may work even when it shouldn’t. To mitigate envy and resentment, reflect or transfer praise and glory. Highlight others who deserve praise and give people ownership of your success. To stop people from oversharing, interject a “me, too” story, or help them destigmatize if it’s too late to do so. Showing vulnerability will make you more likable and more relatable, and will prevent people from expecting you to be superhuman, all-powerful, all-knowing, and always right. Charisma is a powerful tool—use it responsibly.*

*Stretch the boundaries of your comfort zone in low-stakes situations. On the other hand, when you’re in high-stakes situations, don’t take the risk of coming across as uncomfortable or inauthentic. While you’re learning, in difficult or important situations, stick with the charismatic behaviors and styles that are easiest for you. You’re embarking on an expedition. Expect ups and downs, detours, and obstacles along the way. But your interactions will soon start to feel increasingly positive, sometimes even magical. Remember to enjoy this progression. Sit back and appreciate how well the interaction is going, how well you’re doing. Drink it in. Your life is about to change. Enjoy the journey.*
