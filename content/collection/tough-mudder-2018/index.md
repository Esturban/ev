There are some 50 african proverbs that will bring wisdom to your life, or so say some [articles](https://matadornetwork.com/bnt/50-african-proverbs-to-get-you-thinking/).  We managed to accomplish a full tough mudder with an encouraging group like Carolyn, David, and Kate as well as Megan's great support! \

Being active with friends where we overcome obstacles together is a beautiful activity testing body and mind.  Throughout the event you have a chance to motivate your friends and strangers to push beyond their limits.  In events such as Tough Mudder you pay for the privilege to see how your mind will quit well before your body does.  You don't realize your limits until you push yourself physically to see how you can bend belief with your reality.

Coming home afterwards battered from 18km under the sun, sinking into the couch and crushing Wendy's has never felt so rewarding.\
With some momentum looking onto the next challenge, I seek out similar events where I come across [ulta-running](https://ultrarunning.com/features/what-is-ultra-running/) where the shortest measured distance is 50km\

I don't plan on taking it to that level quite yet, but it's humbling to know others are pushing the boundaries of the human condition.  I only ask that you do the same in whatever it is you seek mastery.
