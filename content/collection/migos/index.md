Migo gang has offered the new trap sound which has permeated into every genre in the top 40 charts.  Classics like Hanna Montana paved the way for bangers like Bad and Boujee to make as much headway as the Model T did for automobiles. With addictive language, 808s, and high-hats, Migos keeps it consistent while educating the masses on the new ebonics.
