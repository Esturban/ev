[Charlotte's got a lot](https://www.charlottesgotalot.com/things-to-do/arts-culture) of great things to do.  

# Charlotte  

Charlotte is a gorgeous small city deep into North Carolina with big green banks, both financially and environmentally. Charlotte left a lasting impact on me due to the relaxing ambience of a green and modern city.   
  
# Cool things about Charlotte:  
- No zoo animals in captivity - they consent to paying rent  
- 150,000 square foot NASCAR Hall of Fame gives way to easy streets
- Mint Museum in a banking city capital to see the origins of cash  
- Underwhelming skyscrapers to let you enjoy the sunrise and sunset

# My time  

I have spent time travelling to Charlotte for work and pleasure in the past.  Something about this unique little town grabs my attention due to the unique enterprises which offer employment here as well as 
the beautiful sites that are unobstructed by condos like other major cities. Charlotte is certainly not a major city, but definitely a major on my list of favourites from how much I enjoyed every minute there.
