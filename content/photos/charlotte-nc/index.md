[Charlotte's got a lot](https://www.charlottesgotalot.com/things-to-do/arts-culture) of great things to do.  
  
## Cool things about Charlotte:  
- No zoo animals in captivity - they consent to paying rent  
- 150,000 square foot NASCAR Hall of Fame gives way to easy streets
- Mint Museum in a banking city capital to see the origins of cash  
- Underwhelming skyscrapers to let you enjoy the sunrise and sunset
