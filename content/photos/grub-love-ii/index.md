The first U.S. reference to panini dates to 1956 and a precursor appeared in a 16th-century Italian cookbook. Panini sandwiches became trendy in Milanese bars, called paninoteche as a quick lunch choice for office workers in the 1970s. New York has adapted the panini by selling the sandwiches with distinctive variations.  

Classic fillings in Italy:  

- mozzarella, tomato (plus arugula and/or prosciutto);  
- prosciutto and fontina cheese  
- prosciutto, chese and olive tapenade;  
- bresaola, goat cheese or stracchino (plus lettuce and/or tomato);  
- speck (smoked cured prosciutto from Tyrol), arugula and cheese  
- grilled vegetables and cheese.
