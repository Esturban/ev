# Brief Overview  

[Stellisee](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellisee) is a mountain lake in Zermatt, Valais with a clear reflection of the Matterhorn as the lake is a very desired photo op spot.  

A few kilometer hike away from Zermatt, this slice of serenity offers more than a good location for photography; it offers peace, tranquility and warmth in November along a beautiful trail traversing glaciers. Although that might not seem like a substantial trail, consider the a 15 - 20% all along the way to the final destination.

# Nighttime Fires  

Along the way up, trees tend to get more scarce so I'd recommend Grindjisee as a spot for a *meh* fire if you can get dry enough wood. Trying to set the brush and kindling on fire was quite the exercise when you realize how sappy and moisty some of the trees can be due to frost.  

# Findeln  

This cute mountain ridge town has chalets and restaurants hugging the road along your way up or down with the option to ski through the town once the resort completes opening the remaining pistes.

If you spend some time in Zermatt to enjoy the glaciers and incredible weather:    
1. Stop reading this  
2. Turn off your phone  
3. Grab your bike or two feet (if applicable)  
4. See this paradise on the mountain    
5. Once at the lake, if frozen, throw rocks onto the lake and hear it  


# Must  

The part that truly stood out to me more than anything were the acoustics of being up in the mountains shielded by the Alps allowing this natural chamber to reverberate any sound made;  From laughter to birds chirping or drones buzzing (annoyingly), you'll be surprised with your ability to communicate across the lake without having to raise your voice.  

Truly a remarkable place in the mountains that I encourage others to see.  No infinite gallery of photos can justify the first hand experience. I genuinely recommend it.
