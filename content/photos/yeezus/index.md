## Controversial, Non-commercial  
  
The ye movement has gone intergalactic where it transcends the man. It's no longer about a single album, song, or episode of keeping up with the Kardashians. As much as it could be said that Kanye became a sell out to the music industry that made him the inspirational artist, his following lost sight of the fact that it stopped being about Grammys or Platinum albums when everyone kept classifying him as just an "artist". He's an icon, one particular about excellence.  Hence his love for his fresh white Yeezys.

So what does this tell you about the man? Well, imagine having unconventional ideas that are always criticized and reported. It becomes exhausting and your reaction becomes the core of someone's 15 minutes of fame. It becomes a matter of envious leeches who think first posts of subject matter relating to their lives earns the OP (Original Poster) the street cred to opine. My post on the matter is no different.      

## Life on Blast  
  
Whether it's Kim's reactions to Kanye's comments about ...   

slavery ...

or others mentioning matters of his mental health and questioning Kim on the matter ...

or whether they're going through marital troubles ...

and if you want privacy, you look like the asshole ...

I'd speculate someone who has been this outspoken, still doesn't need someone in their face at 4am in front of their house, trying to enter their garage...  

No price could be placed on how much one might value privacy, especially in these circumstances when your face is recognized globally.  

## Real Friends  

{{< youtube id="fWD9GF-Ogf4" autoplay="true" >}}    

A subtle reminder of the importance to have real friends is to be a real friend. Although followers and fans have fallen off for Kanye West, this is a reminder that someone like Kanye has plenty of real friends who don't seek out a quick buck, but invest in the movement. It's not your journalist, commentator, reality tv show host, or your favourite rapper.  His real friends are your favourite rappers' favourite rapper, inspirational icons, motivational figures, and the professionals.  The people who: 
- are bumping [808s that broke the heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/808s_%26_Heartbreak ) of your [beautiful dark twisted fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Beautiful_Dark_Twisted_Fantasy)    
- [The college dropout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_College_Dropout) that [registered late](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Registration) for [graduation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_(album))  
- know that [yeezus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeezus) lived [the life of pablo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Pablo) and was crucified for [ye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ye_(album))      
- remember that [Jesus is king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Is_King)    
  
It's about being a real person, man.

Ye, like anyone else, is a person figuring out life along the way. Don't be too envious of his achievements because they remain on your list of wants. Instead, dedicate your time to getting after your own goals.
