# Brief Overview  

[Leslie Street Split](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Street_Spit) is certainly not a name I have ever referred to it as.  

It also seems like I am not the only one:  
> Its common name is technically incorrect, since it is not truly a spit, but Torontonians almost never use the official name. The road running along the peninsula is a southern extension of Leslie Street, hence the popular nickname.

A mild environmental retreat amidst the concrete jungle given that Toronto Region Conservation Authority actively manages this Environmentally Sensitivie Area as a result of having an important bird population. These birds from home boast a view of the CN tower unobstructed by condominiums or development, one of the best spots views of Toronto.  

If birds aren't your thing, you'll likely capture sites of muskrats and otters near the farthest tip of the area, usually only accessible on foot or bike.  

# The Lighthouse  

At the farthest end of the park, you can head there to get the nicest view of Lake Ontario in Toronto and similarly explore the beauty of Southern Ontario ecology.  With enough time, this is an excellent spot to spin up a fire and enjoy some s'mores with your friends.  Definitely a must see if you're in Toronto in the summer time and love the outdoors.
