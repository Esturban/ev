# Wuhan - COVID Ground Zero    

> Another COVID post. Great...    
  
Well, it's truly an admiration for the art work here by [@ericwychow](https://instagram.com/ericwychow) who posted the photo at the onset of the pandemic.  

# The Great Lockdown

If pictures can be worth a thousand words, this thousand word summary highlights the blind leadership which guided us into the beginning of a dark age of our modern history. Plaguing us similar to that of [the Great Depression by measures of unemployment, suicide, and economic decline](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-020-00875-4), the kung flu decimates the human experience with a ripple effect not yet calculable. The figure below keeps it real by some of the measures we have mentioned:

# Beauty in the ugly truth   

Like a pig with lipstick, hiding the reality is a form of deception which has been turned into an [art form by China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War). This is not a conspiracy, but a well hidden fact as Chinese intellectuals have compared modern government and military practices to that of the 3000 year old text, Art of War, [here](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4709&context=etd), [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2050423), and [here](https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/february/deception-chinese-way-war). The sources are worth critizing as they are not all by Chinese authors, although they do present an interesting conundrum as China approaches [a nominal GDP greater than the USA by 2028](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2020/12/27/2003749480), [which formerly was projected to happen by 2030](https://financialpost.com/news/economy/china-will-overtake-the-u-s-in-less-than-15-years-hsbc-says).  

Any advantage is an advantage, amirite?  

The efforts put forward by China are admirable when taken into the context of the [100 Year Marathon doctrine created by Mao Tse-Tung back in 1970](https://delawarestatenews.net/opinion/commentary-defining-the-legacy-of-maos-100-year-marathon/). 2049 is fast approaching and the future looks Chinese.
