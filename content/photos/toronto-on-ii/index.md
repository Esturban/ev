The [Scarborough Bluffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Bluffs) 
is a steep-sided escarpment along the ridge of Lake Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Measuring roughly 15km in length reaching 90m above the coast line, what is left is a dangerously beautiful clay cliff traversing a series of beautiful parks overlooking the lake with a few spots to access your boat.  


## Spots to checkout  

Bluffer's Park is definitely a must see, but specifically there are such beautiful parts to the area that exploring it is mildly rewarding to find a small oasis along the coast line.  

### Hidden Beach  

The location below is the spot in the primary picture which I encourage everyone from TOronto to check out to escape a bit of the city vibes while not having to go too far.

I love my city and the remarkable bite-sized beauty it has amidst the urban jungle.
