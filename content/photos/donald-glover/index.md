Something so brief and wholly encompassing with this dude's lyricism. Every artist has a peak and trough and Donald is no different.  His lyrical competence in this album just shock and awe'd a lot of folks who expected him to "only be an actor" or "comedian".  

No. Like most others, there is fidelity to who they are beyond their profession and offer uncanny wisdom by their experience in deep and superficial life.  

Whether it's Derek Comedy, Childish Gambino, Earnest or Donald, this man offers insight through accomplishment and error similarly.   Never be afraid to experiement, explore and fail. Growth in each respect is incredibly valuable.
