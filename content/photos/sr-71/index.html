<p><em>“The world’s fastest airplane was also a pioneer in stealthiness. Note angled tails that greatly decreased radar profile.

<p><em>“…It was during the mid-1960s that the Blackbird, the SR-71, as the successor to the U-2 began bringing us intelligence information both photographic and electronic….”</em></p>
<p><em>“It was 140,000 pounds and 108 feet long, about the size of a tactical bomber called the B-58 Hustler, but with the incredibly small radar cross section of a single-engine Piper Cub. In other words, that is what a radar operator would think he was tracking. Its peculiar cobra shape was only part of the stealthy characteristics of this amazing airplane that flew faster than Mach 3 and higher than 80,000 feet.”</em></p>

<p>This magnificent plane has always stood out to me as a beautiful achievement of aerospace technology in the free world. A rocket-designed jet with capabilities so advanced only for the purpose of collecting information, a thankless job mostly done by machines. Like the device you might be using to read this on, this machine too collects information about you and the things that it will survey. <strong>If you have other devices that connect to your mobile or desktop, these devices collect data to improve your experience in later releases</strong>.</p>
<p>This plane similarly collected information to manage and improve relationships with other geopolitical parties as the US was a novice in understanding all implications of Bretton Woods.</p>
