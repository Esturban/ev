Times Square alone holds 1/6th of the hotel rooms available in NYC with 56% of businesses in the professional services space.   
  
The few times I stayed in Times Square made me wonder just how much it required to keep the businesses afloat enough to pay rent and employees. Single room accommodations range from $1500 - $3000 USD / month.  Commercial real estate rent is easily a factor of 20x generally and 100x in retail locations.

Retail will quickly evolve to adopt event-based appointment spaces where fewer clients will have more options while shopping a custom retail experience.  

> *Most young brands starting out will still be online-based as it is far cheaper to build a national brand online than to open several storefronts across major cities. However, to grow the business, online retailers will need a few stores in good locations.*
