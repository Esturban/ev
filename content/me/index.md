Welcome to my site! 

{{<figure src = "https://media.giphy.com/media/OJqimXwqG7CQE/giphy.gif" height = "300px">}}

I'm Esteban Valencia, a Canadian who likes to build digital and physical products to solve problems.  Youâ€™ve now joined the many special people who have previously discovered my page. Congratulations! 

I have always been interested in sharing my personal and professional experiences with others, so I decided to try archiving and collecting my findings into a blog.  Since I graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I started my career in consulting and data science aimed at driving profitability or reducing costs for businesses by boiling down complex ideas into actionable insights.

I've had the privilege of working at great companies throughout my career since I have been developing software for a dozen years.  I enjoy development, but I love critical thinking and quality thought-provoking content.  Upholding these standards for you, my reader, is what is important to me.  If you like, dislike, or are indifferent to my content,I want to hear about it.
