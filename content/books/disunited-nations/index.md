description: "A third in a series of books about the politics and geography of the future, Peter Zeihan provides insight about the likely behaviours to persist by country in the near and existing future. One might be apprehensive to consider the realities that are conveyed in this book, but it's a starkly different world we have shifted towards living in due to the regular American-dominated order. The USA :us: will persist as an indifferent mercenary for hire that will work in their own interest while the God-complex race for the next \"Superpower\" will prove futile in the light of economic and social collapses in places like China, Germany and Brazil. Meanwhile, the least likely candidates such as France, Iran, and Argentina will supersede the fate others have cynically attempted to predict for them."
