      <description>The Scarborough Bluffs is a steep-sided escarpment along the ridge of Lake Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Measuring roughly 15km in length reaching 90m above the coast line, what is left is a dangerously beautiful clay cliff traversing a series of beautiful parks overlooking the lake with a few spots to access your boat.
Spots to checkout Bluffer&amp;rsquo;s Park is definitely a must see, but specifically there are such beautiful parts to the area that exploring it is mildly rewarding to find a small oasis along the coast line.</description>

      <description>Brief Overview Leslie Street Split is certainly not a name I have ever referred to it as.
It also seems like I am not the only one:
 Its common name is technically incorrect, since it is not truly a spit, but Torontonians almost never use the official name. The road running along the peninsula is a southern extension of Leslie Street, hence the popular nickname.
  Same Wikipedia as above  A mild environmental retreat amidst the concrete jungle given that Toronto Region Conservation Authority actively manages this Environmentally Sensitivie Area as a result of having an important bird population.</description>
