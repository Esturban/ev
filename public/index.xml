      <description>Controversial, Non-commercial The ye movement has gone intergalactic where it transcends the man. It&amp;rsquo;s no longer about a single album, song, or episode of keeping up with the Kardashians. As much as it could be said that Kanye became a sell out to the music industry that made him the inspirational artist, his following lost sight of the fact that it stopped being about Grammys or Platinum albums when everyone kept classifying him as just an &amp;ldquo;artist&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Stellisee - Zermatt, Valais</title>

      <description>Brief Overview Stellisee is a mountain lake in Zermatt, Valais with a clear reflection of the Matterhorn as the lake is a very desired photo op spot.
A few kilometer hike away from Zermatt, this slice of serenity offers more than a good location for photography; it offers peace, tranquility and warmth in November along a beautiful trail traversing glaciers. Although that might not seem like a substantial trail, consider the a 15 - 20% all along the way to the final destination.</description>

      <description>Charlotte&amp;rsquo;s got a lot of great things to do.
Charlotte Charlotte is a gorgeous small city deep into North Carolina with big green banks, both financially and environmentally. Charlotte left a lasting impact on me due to the relaxing ambience of a green and modern city.
Cool things about Charlotte:  No zoo animals in captivity - they consent to paying rent 150,000 square foot NASCAR Hall of Fame gives way to easy streets Mint Museum in a banking city capital to see the origins of cash Underwhelming skyscrapers to let you enjoy the sunrise and sunset  My time I have spent time travelling to Charlotte for work and pleasure in the past.</description>

      <title>Scarborough Bluffs - Toronto, ON</title>
      <link>/photos/toronto-on-i/</link>

      <description>The Scarborough Bluffs is a steep-sided escarpment along the ridge of Lake Ontario in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Measuring roughly 15km in length reaching 90m above the coast line, what is left is a dangerously beautiful clay cliff traversing a series of beautiful parks overlooking the lake with a few spots to access your boat.
Spots to checkout Bluffer&amp;rsquo;s Park is definitely a must see, but specifically there are such beautiful parts to the area that exploring it is mildly rewarding to find a small oasis along the coast line.</description>

      <title>Cheery Beach/Tommy Thompson/Leslie Street Split - Toronto, ON</title>

      <guid>/photos/toronto-on-ii/</guid>
      <description>Brief Overview Leslie Street Split is certainly not a name I have ever referred to it as.
It also seems like I am not the only one:
 Its common name is technically incorrect, since it is not truly a spit, but Torontonians almost never use the official name. The road running along the peninsula is a southern extension of Leslie Street, hence the popular nickname.
  Same Wikipedia as above  A mild environmental retreat amidst the concrete jungle given that Toronto Region Conservation Authority actively manages this Environmentally Sensitivie Area as a result of having an important bird population.</description>
