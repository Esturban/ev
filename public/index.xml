      <description>Welcome to my site!
 I&amp;rsquo;m Esteban Valencia, a Canadian who likes to build digital and physical products to solve problems. Youâ€™ve now joined the many special people who have previously discovered my page. Congratulations!
I have always been interested in sharing my personal and professional experiences with others, so I decided to try archiving and collecting my findings into a blog. Since I graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a degree in Electrical Engineering, I started my career in consulting and data science aimed at driving profitability or reducing costs for businesses by boiling down complex ideas into actionable insights.</description>
