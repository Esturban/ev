<p><em>During our hiring process, we gathered many perspectives on each candidate, in the belief that any single view might be skewed, but some of what we collected was irrelevant. Every candidate had to provide an SAT score, graduate school test scores if they had them, and college transcripts. When I interviewed, I couldn’t believe that Google wanted me to call my college and get transcripts from thirteen years ago. The requirement sounded even nuttier to people who had been out of school for twenty or thirty years.xviii We thought requesting grades and transcripts was a blunt instrument to get at smarts. And it did weed out the disappointing number of people who lied about their records. But in 2010, our analyses revealed that academic performance didn’t predict job performance beyond the first two or three years after college, so we stopped requiring grades and transcripts except from recent graduates. In the mid-2000s, interviewers could ask candidates any questions they wanted, but they didn’t follow any particular structure, so their feedback often lacked insight. The absence of coordination across interviewers also meant we often forgot to ask about some specific attribute, so the candidate had to come back for yet more interviews.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 67 (location ~ 1014-1023)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As you might imagine, the hiring machine moved glacially. Being hired by Google could take six months or longer, and a candidate could endure fifteen or even twenty-five interviews before getting an offer. A Googler might interview ten or more candidates out of hundreds or thousands who applied for a single job, investing ten to twenty hours of time in interviewing and writing feedback for every hire that was eventually made. Now multiply that across the fifteen to twenty-five interviews each successful candidate went through, and you have 150 to 500 hours of employee time invested in every hire before even considering the time spent by recruiters, hiring committees, senior leaders, and the founders.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 67 (location ~ 1027-1032)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>One of the main reasons we focus so much on growing the company is to have enough great jobs for our people. Larry once explained: “We’re a medium-size company in terms of employee count. We have tens of thousands of employees. There are organizations out there that have millions of employees. That’s a factor of a hundred, basically. So imagine what we could do if we had a hundred times as many employees.” He often tells employees that in the future they could each be running a business as big as Google is today, while still being part of the company. So the hiring system was functional, but it was a far cry from being a self-replicating talent machine. By the time I joined in 2006, it felt like every other person I met in Silicon Valley had had some painful experience with Google’s hiring juggernaut: One software engineer I met told me about the arrogance of the Googlers who interviewed him; my real estate agent’s brother had been rejected by Google and then a week later gotten a call from a Google recruiter for the same job; the waiter at the local diner had a friend who was interviewing at Google—and had been interviewing for the past eight months! Even Googlers complained about how long and arbitrary the hiring process seemed, even though they all agreed that it did result in remarkable hiring quality.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 69 (location ~ 1045-1054)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My first reaction was “How much Kool-Aid have these people been drinking?” But as I spoke to more people and looked at our surveys, I saw these responses weren’t a fluke. People actually loved their work experience and wanted other people to share it. Only rarely did people mention the referral bonus. A referral bonus is an extrinsic motivator, meaning that it is motivation that comes from outside yourself. Other extrinsic motivators include public recognition, salary increases, promotions, trophies, and trips. This is in contrast to intrinsic motivators, which come from inside yourself. Examples of these include a desire to give back to your family or community, slaking your curiosity, or the sense of accomplishment or pride that comes from completing a difficult task. What we learned is that Googlers were making referrals for intrinsic reasons. We could have offered $10,000 for each referral and it likely wouldn’t have made a difference. But something didn’t make sense. If people were making referrals for intrinsic reasons, why did the referral rate slow down? Were people having less fun at Google? Were we straying from our mission?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 70 (location ~ 1070-1078)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Our overreliance on referrals had simply started to exhaust Googlers’ networks. In response, we started introducing “aided recall” exercises. Aided recall is a marketing research technique where subjects are shown an ad or told the name of a product and asked if they remember being exposed to it. For example, you might be asked if you remember seeing any laundry detergent commercials in the past month. And then you might be asked if you remember seeing any Tide commercials.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 71 (location ~ 1088-1091)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Along the way, we noticed something startling. The very best people aren’t out there looking for work. Great-performing people are happy and being amply rewarded where they are today. They don’t occur to people as referrals, because why would you bother referring someone who is happy at their current job? And they certainly don’t apply for jobs. So we rebuilt our staffing team. In the past they had focused on filtering what came in: screening resumes and scheduling interviews. Now they’ve become an in-house recruiting firm, with the goal of seeking out and cultivating the best people on the planet. Using a homegrown product called gHire, a candidate database we’ve built and enhanced with a variety of tools for sifting through and tracking candidates, hundreds of brilliant recruiters find and cultivate these individuals over time—sometimes over years.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 72 (location ~ 1102-1108)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Today our own Google Careers website is one of our best sources of candidates, though we’re hard at work making it even better. Corporate job sites are awful. They are difficult to search, filled with generic job descriptions that don’t tell you anything about what the job really is or what the team you’ll be part of is like, and provide no feedback on whether you’d be good for a role or not. We started addressing this in 2012. For example, a candidate can now submit not only a resume but also develop a personal skill profile. Using Google+ “circles” (a group you select and which has access only to what you want to share… no more sharing the pics of your friend’s wild bachelor party with your boss), they can choose to share those skills with Google, other employers, or any subset of people and organizations they wish. They can get in touch with current Googlers to find out what it’s really like to work here. With an applicant’s permission, we’re then able to stay in touch with people who have skills we don’t need today but may in the future, and reach out to them as our needs change. We don’t use many recruitment firms, not because they are bad (some of my best friends are executive recruiters… really) but because the stringency and peculiarity of our hiring standards and process, combined with our existing capabilities in recruitment, mean that there are only a handful of situations where recruitment firms help us.</em></p>

<p><em>Tricia Prickett and Neha Gada-Jain, two psychology students at the University of Toledo, collaborated with their professor Frank Bernieri and reported in a 2000 study that judgments made in the first ten seconds of an interview could predict the outcome of the interview.81 They discovered this by videotaping real interviews and then having study participants watch short clips: Slices were extracted from each interview, beginning with the interviewee knocking on the door and ending 10 seconds after the interviewee took a seat, and shown to naïve observers. Observers provided ratings of employability, competence, intelligence, ambition, trustworthiness, confidence, nervousness, warmth, politeness, likability, and expressiveness. For 9 of the 11 variables, thin-slice judgments correlated significantly with the final evaluation of the actual interviewers. Thus, immediate impressions based on a handshake and brief introduction predicted the outcome of a structured employment interview.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 78 (location ~ 1190-1197)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Malcolm Gladwell spoke with Richard Nisbett, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, about our unwitting self-deception: The basis of the illusion is that we are somehow confident that we are getting what is there, that we are able to read off a person’s disposition.… When you have an interview with someone and have an hour with them, you don’t conceptualize that as taking a sample of a person’s behavior, let alone a possibly biased sample, which is what it is. What you think is that you are seeing a hologram, a small and fuzzy image but still the whole person.83</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 79 (location ~ 1203-1208)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Performance on these kinds of questions is at best a discrete skill that can be improved through practice, eliminating their utility for assessing candidates. At worst, they rely on some trivial bit of information or insight that is withheld from the candidate, and serve primarily to make the interviewer feel clever and self-satisfied. They have little if any ability to predict how candidates will perform in a job.84 This is in part because of the irrelevance of the task (how many times in your day job do you have to estimate how many gas stations there are?), in part because there’s no correlation between fluid intelligence (which is predictive of job performance) and insight problems like brainteasers, and in part because there is no way to distinguish between someone who is innately bright and someone who has just practiced this skill. Full disclosure: Some of these interview questions have been and I’m sure continue to be used at Google. Sorry about that. We do everything we can to discourage this, as it’s really just a waste of everyone’s time. And when our senior leaders—myself included—review applicants each week, we ignore the answers to these questions. As we saw with our billboard, some attempts at assessment just don’t work. Happily, the 2013 movie The Internship, about two washed-up watch salesmen who decide to become interns at Google, gave the answer to the blender question, so at least that one can’t be asked as an interview question anymore.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 80 (location ~ 1214-1225)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The best predictor of how someone will perform in a job is a work sample test (29 percent). This entails giving candidates a sample piece of work, similar to that which they would do in the job, and assessing their performance at it. Even this can’t predict performance perfectly, since actual performance also depends on other skills, such as how well you collaborate with others, adapt to uncertainty, and learn. And worse, many jobs don’t have nice, neat pieces of work that you can hand to a candidate. You can (and should) offer a work sample test to someone applying to work in a call center or to do very task-oriented work, but for many jobs there are too many variables involved day-to-day to allow the construction of a representative work sample.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 81 (location ~ 1234-1239)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The second-best predictors of performance are tests of general cognitive ability (26 percent). In contrast to case interviews and brainteasers, these are actual tests with defined right and wrong answers, similar to what you might find on an IQ test. They are predictive because general cognitive ability includes the capacity to learn, and the combination of raw intelligence and learning ability will make most people successful in most jobs. The problem, however, is that most standardized tests of this type discriminate against non-white, non-male test takers (at least in the United States). The SAT consistently underpredicts how women and non-whites will perform in college. Phyllis Rosser’s 1989 study of the SAT compared high school girls and boys of comparable ability and college performance, and found that the girls scored lower on the SAT than the boys.86 Reasons why include the test format (there is no gender gap on Advanced Placement tests, which use short answers and essays instead of multiple choice); test scoring (boys are more likely to guess after eliminating one possible answer, which improves their scores); and even the content of questions (“females did better on SAT questions about relationships, aesthetics, and the humanities, while males did better on questions about sports, the physical sciences, and business”).xxiv These kinds of studies have been repeated multiple times, and while standardized tests of this sort have gotten better, they are still not great.xxv As a proof point, Pitzer College, a liberal arts college in Southern California, made reporting test scores optional for applicants who had at least a 3.5 grade point average (GPA) or were in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. Since then, their average admitted-student GPA has grown 8 percent and they’ve had a 58 percent increase in students of color.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 82 (location ~ 1244-1258)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are two kinds of structured interviews: behavioral and situational. Behavioral interviews ask candidates to describe prior achievements and match those to what is required in the current job (i.e., “Tell me about a time…?”). Situational interviews present a job-related hypothetical situation (i.e., “What would you do if…?”). A diligent interviewer will probe deeply to assess the veracity and thought process behind the stories told by the candidate. Structured interviews are predictive even for jobs that are themselves unstructured. We’ve also found that they cause both candidates and interviewers to have a better experience and are perceived to be most fair.89 So why don’t more companies use them? Well, they are hard to develop: You have to write them, test them, and make sure interviewers stick to them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 83 (location ~ 1262-1269)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>So what assessment techniques do we use? The goal of our interview process is to predict how candidates will perform once they join the team. We achieve that goal by doing what the science says: combining behavioral and situational structured interviews with assessments of cognitive ability, conscientiousness, and leadership.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 84 (location ~ 1279-1281)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The neat trick here is that, while interviewers can certainly make up their own questions if they wish, by making it easier to rely on the prevalidated ones, we’re giving a little nudge toward better, more reliable interviewing. Examples of interview questions include: Tell me about a time your behavior had a positive impact on your team. (Follow-ups: What was your primary goal and why? How did your teammates respond? Moving forward, what’s your plan?)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 84 (location ~ 1287-1291)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A concise hiring rubric addresses all these issues because it distills messy, vague, and complicated work situations down to measurable, comparable results. For example, imagine you’re interviewing someone for a tech-support job. A solid answer for “identifies solutions” would be, “I fixed the laptop battery like my customer asked.” An outstanding answer would be, “I figured that since he had complained about battery life in the past and was about to go on a trip, I’d also get a spare battery in case he needed it.” Applying a boring-seeming rubric is the key to quantifying and taming the mess. If you don’t want to build all this yourself, it’s easy enough to find online examples of structured interview questions that you can adapt and use in your environments. For example, the US Department of Veterans Affairs has a site with almost a hundred sample questions at <a href="http://www.va.gov/pbi/questions.asp">www.va.gov/pbi/questions.asp</a>. Use them. You’ll do better at hiring immediately. Remember too that you don’t just want to assess the candidate. You want them to fall in love with you. Really. You want them to have a great experience, have their concerns addressed, and come away feeling like they just had the best day of their lives. Interviews are awkward because you’re having an intimate conversation with someone you just met, and the candidate is in a very vulnerable position. It’s always worth investing time to make sure they feel good at the end of it, because they will tell other people about their experience—and because it’s the right way to treat people.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 86 (location ~ 1312-1323)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In addition to testing technical hires on their engineering ability, we realized that there were four distinct attributes that predicted whether someone would be successful at Google: General Cognitive Ability. Not surprisingly, we want smart people who can learn and adapt to new situations. Remember that this is about understanding how candidates have solved hard problems in real life and how they learn, not checking GPAs and SATs. Leadership. Also not surprising, right? Every company wants leaders. But Google looks for a particular type of leadership, called “emergent leadership.” This is a form of leadership that ignores formal designations—at Google there is rarely a formal leader of any effort. I recall being asked what it meant that I was the “executive sponsor” for a project that culminated in 10 percent salary increases for everyone in the company. I explained that not only did I not know, but that within Google it was a meaningless designation. In all likelihood, a relatively new hire had put those words next to my name because my title was Senior Vice President, but my role on the project was the same as anyone else’s: Provide an opinion, do some analysis, and help get the right outcome.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 88 (location ~ 1337-1346)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Googleyness.” We want people who will thrive at Google. This isn’t a neatly defined box, but includes attributes like enjoying fun (who doesn’t?), a certain dose of intellectual humility (it’s hard to learn if you can’t admit that you might be wrong), a strong measure of conscientiousness (we want owners, not employees), comfort with ambiguity (we don’t know how our business will evolve, and navigating Google internally requires dealing with a lot of ambiguity), and evidence that you’ve taken some courageous or interesting paths in your life.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 88 (location ~ 1349-1353)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Role-Related Knowledge. By far the least important attribute we screen for is whether someone actually knows anything about the job they are taking on. Our reasoning and experience is that someone who has done the same task—successfully—for many years is likely to see a situation at Google and replicate the same solution that has worked for them. As the psychologist Abraham Maslow wrote: “I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail.”92 The problem with this approach is that you lose the opportunity to create something new. In contrast, our experience is that curious people who are open to learning will figure out the right answers in almost all cases, and have a much greater chance of creating a truly novel solution.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 89 (location ~ 1354-1359)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Todd Carlisle, now the HR leader for one of our business teams but at the time a PhD analyst on our staffing team, looked at the question of whether having up to twenty-five interviews per candidate was actually helpful or not. He found that four interviews were enough to predict whether or not we should hire someone with 86 percent confidence. Every additional interviewer after the fourth added only 1 percent more predictive power. It simply wasn’t worth the extra time for Google or the suffering for the candidate, so we implemented a “Rule of Four,” limiting the number of interviews a candidate could have on-site (though we allowed exceptions in certain cases). That change alone shaved our median time to hire to 47 days, compared to 90 to 180 days in the past, and has saved employees hundreds of thousands of hours.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>In every interview I’ve ever had with another company, I’ve met my potential boss and several peers. But rarely have I met anyone who would be working for me. Google turns this approach upside down. You’ll probably meet your prospective manager (where possible—for some large job groups like “software engineer” or “account strategist” there is no single hiring manager) and a peer, but more important is meeting one or two of the people who will work for you. In a way, their assessments are more important than anyone else’s—after all, they’re going to have to live with you. The third key difference in our approach, therefore, is to have a subordinate interview a prospective hire. It sends a strong signal to candidates about Google being nonhierarchical, and it also helps prevent cronyism, where managers hire their old buddies for their new teams. We find that the best candidates leave subordinates feeling inspired or excited to learn from them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 95 (location ~ 1446-1452)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If the hiring committee rejects the candidate, the process stops there. If they are supportive of a candidate, their feedback is added to the hiring packet and sent to the Senior Leader Reviews. In these weekly meetings, some of our top executives provide another layer of objectivity and assess that week’s candidates. We’ve had weeks with more than three hundred candidates and weeks with only twenty. At this stage, candidates are recommended for hire, rejected, or more information is requested, typically to test an attribute further or to reconsider the level at which the candidate would be hired. The most common reason for rejection at this stage in the process? Culture.xxxi While Googlers possess the gamut of political views, the cultural values of transparency and voice are widely held and core to how we operate. As Jeff Huber recently said about one candidate, “This is a great candidate—strong technical interview scores, clearly very smart and well-qualified—but sufficiently arrogant that none of the interviewers want him on their team. This is a great candidate, but not for Google.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 97 (location ~ 1480-1488)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If we followed a more traditional process, it’s likely we could hire people in a week or two instead of the six weeks it takes today. And we do have the capability to move more quickly when needed—every few weeks we’ll run an expedited process for candidates who have an offer from another firm that expires if they don’t respond quickly,xxxii and we’ve run one-day hiring programs on college campuses in the United States and India to test if that improved our offer acceptance rates. So far, the greater speed doesn’t materially improve candidate experience or the rate at which candidates accept our offers, so our focus remains on finding ways to hire people we might overlook rather than on moving faster.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 98 (location ~ 1496-1501)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>So how do you create your own self-replicating staffing machine? Set a high bar for quality. Before you start recruiting, decide what attributes you want and define as a group what great looks like. A good rule of thumb is to hire only people who are better than you. Do not compromise. Ever. Find your own candidates. LinkedIn, Google+, alumni databases, and professional associations make it easy. Assess candidates objectively. Include subordinates and peers in the interviews, make sure interviewers write good notes, and have an unbiased group of people make the actual hiring decision. Periodically return to those notes and compare them to how the new employee is doing, to refine your assessment capability. Give candidates a reason to join. Make clear why the work you are doing matters, and let the candidate experience the astounding people they will get to work with. This is easy to write, but I can tell you from experience that it’s very hard to do. Managers hate the idea that they can’t hire their own people. Interviewers can’t stand being told that they have to follow a certain format for the interview or for their feedback. People will disagree with data if it runs counter to their intuition and argue that the quality bar doesn’t need to be so high for every job. Do not give in to the pressure. Fight for quality.</em></p>

<p><em>Invariably, within a few meetings, that’s the seat that ends up left open. Humans turn out to be awfully good rule followers. Before 2007, the hiring policy at Google was “Hire as many great people as you can.” In 2007, we introduced hiring budgets because we were hiring more people than we could absorb. Each team now had a finite number of people they could hire each year. I was stunned by how quickly we shifted from an abundance mentality to one of scarcity, as jobs became a precious resource that had to be conserved. Roles would be held open longer than ever because teams wanted to be sure they were getting the best person. Internal transfers became more difficult because they required an open headcount slot.</em></p>

<p><em>Managers have a tendency to amass and exert power. Employees have a tendency to follow orders. What’s mind-blowing is that many of us play both roles, manager and employee, at the same time. We each have experienced the frustration of a controlling manager, and we have each experienced the frustration of managing people who just won’t listen. At this point you’re probably thinking, Wow, things got pretty dark all of a sudden. There is hope. “Does your manager trust you?” is a profound question. If you believe people are fundamentally good, and if your organization is able to hire well, there is nothing to fear from giving your people freedom. Remember that the primary definition of “asylum” is “a place of refuge.” One of the nobler aspirations of a workplace should be that it’s a place of refuge where people are free to create, build, and grow. Why not let the inmates run the asylum? The first step to mass empowerment is making it safe for people to speak up. In Japan there’s a saying: Deru kugi wa utareru. “The stake that sticks up gets hammered down.” It’s a warning to conform. This is why we take as much power away from managers as we can. The less formal authority they have, the fewer carrots and sticks they have to lord over their teams, and the more latitude the teams have to innovate.</em></p>

<p><em>To be transparent, it’s become harder to hold this line as we’ve gotten bigger. Titles that we used to ban outright, like those containing the words “global” or “strategy,” have crept into the company. We had banned “global” because it’s both self-evident and self-aggrandizing. Isn’t every job global, unless it specifically says it isn’t? “Strategy” is similarly grandiose. Sun Tzu was a strategist. Alexander the Great was a strategist. Having been a so-called strategy consultant for many years, I can tell you that putting the word “strategy” in a title is a great way to get people to apply for a job, but it does little to change the nature of the work. We policed the titles as people were hired, but failed to consistently scrub our employee database to catch the titles people gave themselves after joining.xxxvi We just hope our efforts make them matter less than in most other places.</em></p>

<p><em>If you want a nonhierarchical environment, you need visible reminders of your values. Otherwise, your human nature inevitably reasserts itself. Symbols and stories matter. Ron Nessen, who served as press secretary for President Gerald Ford, shared a story about his boss’s leadership style: “He had a dog, Liberty. Liberty has an accident on the rug in the Oval Office and one of the Navy stewards rushes in to clean it up. Jerry Ford says, ‘I’ll do that. Get out of the way, I’ll do that. No man ought to have to clean up after another man’s dog.’ ”99 What makes this vignette so compelling is that the most powerful man in the United States not only understood his personal responsibility, but also appreciated the symbolic value of demonstrating it.</em></p>

<p><em>Make decisions based on data, not based on managers’ opinions In addition to minimizing the trappings and affectations of power, we rely on data to make decisions. Omid Kordestani was at Netscape before coming to Google. As Omid tells it, “Jim Barksdale, the legendary CEO of Netscape, in one of these management meetings said, ‘If you have facts, present them and we’ll use them. But if you have opinions, we’re gonna use mine.’ ” The tone of Barksdale’s comment is both funny and on the edge of tyrannical, but it captures well how most successful managers think. After all, they (ideally) became managers because they demonstrated good judgment, so why shouldn’t we rely on their judgment? At the same time, Barksdale highlights the tremendous opportunity for all of us as individuals. Relying on data—indeed, expecting every conversation to be rooted in data—upends the traditional role of managers. It transforms them from being providers of intuition to facilitators in a search for truth, with the most useful facts being brought to bear on each decision. In a sense, every meeting becomes a Hegelian dialectic, with presenters providing a thesis and the folks in the room providing an antithesis, spurning opinion, questioning facts, and testing which decision is correct. The result is synthesis, a closer approximation of truth than if we had relied on mere pronouncements. One of the core principles of Google has always been “Don’t politick. Use data.”</em></p>

<p><em>Enter Brian Ong and Janet Cho. Brian leads the team that tracks and measures every part of our hiring process, but several years ago he was a member of our People Analytics team, charged with making sure we supplemented our judgment with facts. Janet is our VP in charge of all people issues related to our major product areas, such as search, advertising, data centers, and Gmail. They decided that a more effective and long-lasting approach would be simply to share all the promotion data with Googlers. They crunched the numbers, organized a series of talks, recorded them so people could watch them later, and built a site to share all the data. It turns out: Working with much more senior people has only a small effect. Fifty-one percent of all people nominated for promotion were promoted. For those who worked with much more senior people, the promotion rate was 54 percent. A little higher, but not much. The product area doesn’t matter. There are occasional differences of a few percentage points in one year or another, but in general your odds of promotion are the same no matter what you work on. Bad feedback doesn’t hurt you. In fact, almost every person who gets promoted has constructive feedback in their promotion materials. What ruins someone’s chances is evidence of something seriously wrong, such as poorly organized or consistently buggy code. The other warning sign is a conspicuous absence of information. A promotion packet that has no constructive feedback is actually a warning sign to review committees. Promotion candidates shouldn’t be afraid to solicit and receive less-than-glowing feedback, since it won’t derail them, and it will give them explicit coaching on how to improve. It turns out that when you present people with reality, they want to get better.</em></p>

<p><em>Find ways for people to shape their work and the company In addition to stripping leaders of the traditional tools of power and relying on facts to make decisions, we give Googlers uncommon freedom in shaping their own work and the company. Google isn’t the first to do so. For over sixty-five years, 3M has offered its employees 15 percent of their time to explore: “A core belief of 3M is that creativity needs freedom. That’s why, since about 1948, we’ve encouraged our employees to spend 15% of their working time on their own projects. To take our resources, to build up a unique team, and to follow their own insights in pursuit of problem-solving.”103 Post-it Notes famously came out of this program, as did a clever abrasive material, Trizact, which somehow sharpens itself as it’s used. Our version is 20 percent time, meaning that engineers have 20 percent of their week to focus on projects that interest them, outside of their day jobs but presumably still related to Google’s work (at Google that still covers a lot of territory). Outside of engineering, we don’t formally label projects as 20 percent time, but Googlers often find time for their own side projects, whether it was salesman Chris Genteel deciding to help minority-owned businesses get online (which eventually turned into a full-time job for him) or Anna Botelho, a former competitive ballroom dancer and member of our real estate team, enlisting other Googlers to teach dance classes at Google.</em></p>

<p><em>Googlers don’t restrict themselves to creating products. They also involve themselves in deciding how we run the company. A few years back, we gave a group of thirty engineers anonymous performance and pay data for everyone in engineering, and allowed them to shape how bonuses would be allocated. They wanted the system to be more meritocratic. For example, imagine two engineers performing at the same level, but one was better able to negotiate his salary when he joined Google. Let’s say he had a salary of $100,000 per year, and another engineer, who didn’t think to negotiate, had a salary of $90,000. Since they performed at the same level, both received a 20 percent bonus. That’s not fair, argued the engineers, because the first person received $20,000 in bonus, while the second had contributed the same impact but was paid only $18,000. So, at their request, we changed the basis for bonus calculation from actual salaries to the median salary of all people in that job. That ensured that both people received a bonus commensurate with their impact. As an aside, this is a very real issue in most companies. There is a well-documented average salary difference between men and women. One source of this is a difference in men’s and women’s propensity to negotiate when they are being hired. For example, Linda Babcock of Carnegie Mellon University and author Sara Laschever reported that starting salaries for male MBA graduates from Carnegie Mellon were higher than for females, largely because men were more likely to ask for higher salaries. Fifty-seven percent of men negotiated, compared to 7 percent of women.105 In part thanks to input from Googlers, our pay systems are built with a goal of eliminating this kind of structural bias and inequity. But we didn’t always approach compensation, utilization, hiring, or other people issues so analytically. Back in 2004, when we had about 2,500 Googlers, Larry and Sergey felt we were becoming so big that they couldn’t get an intuitive sense of how happy people were just by walking around and talking to people they knew. Their solution: Stacy Sullivan should interview everyone and find out.</em></p>

Every manager with more than three respondents gets a report, dubbed MyGeist. This report—which is actually an interactive online tool—allows managers to view and share personalized reports that contain a summary of the Googlegeist scores for their organizations. Whether their team is three or thirty Googlers strong, managers get a clear sense of how they’re doing according to their teams. With one click, managers can choose to share with just their direct teams, with their broader organizations, with a customized list of Googlers, or even with all of Google. And most do.</em></p>

For example, we have five questions that predict whether employees are likely to quit. If a team’s responses to those five questions fall below 70 percent favorable, we know more people will leave during the following year unless we intervene. If scores fall below 70 percent for just one question, the issue is identified and Googlers and leaders partner with their People Operations colleagues to improve that team’s experience (though note that results are never tied back to any individual Googler). We measure many other outcomes, such as our pace of execution and our culture, but above all we want to continue launching cool new stuff, and we want to ensure that the people we’ve worked so hard to hire remain at Google for a long time.</em></p>

<p><em>“Code health” refers to maintaining the overall sustainability and scalability of code to minimize this problem. (“Scalability” is tech industry jargon—it’s what we mean when we talk about being able to take a small solution and make it work for the entire world. “Scale” means something works equally well for a hundred users and for one billion users.) It requires regularly researching and creating techniques to reduce complexity, and integrating an ethos of simplification into our code development process. Googlegeist told us that we weren’t paying enough attention to this, or rewarding it sufficiently. Rewards were accruing to those who generated the most volume of code, rather than the highest-quality code. We could have set company-wide goals for code health, or created new jobs entirely focused on checking others’ work. Or our CEO could have just mandated that everyone had to focus on code health for the next month. Instead, a group of engineers self-organized and decided to tackle the problem after it was highlighted in Googlegeist. First, they worked to improve recognition of the importance of code health through education and publicity, including Tech Talks, articles on our intranet, and emails sent to our popular “eng-announce” internal listserv explaining why code health matters. They asked revered technical executives like Alan Eustace to work mentions of code health into public talks and emails about performance management and promotions. Second, the engineers partnered with People Operations to ensure code health became an essential component of performance calibration sessions and promotion committees, and incorporated questions into Googlegeist to check on progress annually. Third, they worked to build tools to automatically review code health. For example, our Munich code health group developed a tool that automatically detects dead code in C++ and Java. Spotting and excising dead code makes your programs run faster and more reliably. Finally, the engineers created the Citizenship Awards, an opportunity for Googlers who contribute to healthy code to be recognized by their peers and leaders, all of whom benefit from their work.</em></p>

<p><em>Expect little from people, get little. Expect a lot… Some will argue that this kind of mass empowerment leads to anarchy, or to a situation where, since everyone’s opinion is valued, anyone can object and derail an effort—an environment where ten thousand people can say no but no one can say yes. The reality is that every issue needs a decision maker. Managed properly, the result of these approaches is not some transcendent moment of unanimity. Rather, it is a robust, data-driven discussion that brings the best ideas to light, so that when a decision is made, it leaves the dissenters with enough context to understand and respect the rationale for the decision, even if they disagree with the outcome. This approach almost always works. When it fails, there’s a simple rule to follow: Escalate to the next layer of the company and present the facts. If they can’t decide, escalate again.

<p><em>You don’t need to have Google’s size or analytical horsepower to unleash the creativity of your people. As a leader, giving up status symbols is the most powerful message you can send that you care about what your teams have to say. When I worked for a fifty-person company, the greatest thing the chief operating officer, Toby Smith, did to make me feel like an owner was share an office with me. By watching him each day I learned about our business and how to connect with people (he always answered the phone with a startlingly warm “How ARE you?”), as well as benefited from his office tips (when you buy dress shoes, buy two identical pairs and rotate them so they don’t wear out from daily usexli ). There are free survey tools, including one built into Google Sheets, that let you ask employees how they are feeling and what they’d like to do differently. Using small pilots allows the most vocal employees to grapple with the complexities of a situation. It’s easy to complain from the sidelines. Being charged with implementing your ideas is often much harder and can moderate more extreme and unrealistic perspectives. All this adds up to happier people generating better ideas. The truth is that people usually live up to your expectations, whether those expectations are high or low.</em></p>

Most organizations are designed to resist change and enfeeble employees. When I tell CEOs that many Googlers can nominate themselves for promotion, or that they can ask our CEO any question, the most common response is that it sounds great in theory but would never work at their company: People won’t focus on their real work; gathering all those facts would just slow us down (!); the lawyers won’t let us do it; people (the very ones that are their “most important asset”) won’t make good decisions; I like my special parking space.… But it does work.

<p><em>We deliberately set ambitious goals that we know we won’t be able to achieve in all cases. If you’re achieving all your goals, you’re not setting them aggressively enough. Astro Teller,xlii who oversees Google[x], our team that developed Glass (an eyeglass-mounted computer with a viewscreen the size of your fingernail) and our self-driving cars, describes it this way: “If you want your car to get fifty miles per gallon, fine. You can retool your car a little bit. But if I tell you it has to run on a gallon of gas for five hundred miles, you have to start over.” We don’t set all our goals quite that aggressively, but there’s wisdom in his approach.

<p><em>Google’s performance management system has always started with goal setting. In the early 2000s, Google board member John Doerr introduced us to a practice he had seen Intel use with much success: OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results. The results must be specific, measurable, and verifiable; if you achieve all your results, you’ve attained your objective. For example, if the objective is to improve search quality by x percent, key results that contribute to that would be better search relevance (how useful the results are to the user), and latency (how quickly the results show up). It’s important to have both a quality and an efficiency measure, because otherwise engineers could just solve for one at the expense of the other. It’s not enough to give you a perfect result if it takes three minutes. We have to be both relevant and fast.</em></p>

<p><em>Across the board, the new process was viewed as no worse than the old. While it seems a Pyrrhic victory, it was actually a huge relief for me. Some Googlers had worried that the loss of the precision conveyed by a 41-point rating scale would mean that our ratings would become less useful and meaningful. Instead, Googlers’ survey responses revealed what we’d suspected all along: The forty-one points created only an illusion of precision. Most Googlers admitted that for many ratings it wasn’t possible to distinguish within plus or minus 0.1. For example, there was no consistent agreement about what a 3.1 was versus a 3.2. As Megan Huth, a member of our People and Innovation Lab, explained, “This created the possibility that the ratings were neither reliable nor valid. Given the same person and the same performance, she might be rated a 3.2 or a 3.3 depending on the rater and the calibration group. This means the rating isn’t reliable. And if she gets a 3.3 when she’s really a 3.2, then the rating also isn’t valid—it doesn’t reflect reality.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 141 (location ~ 2157-2165)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Calibration adds a step. But it is critical to ensure fairness. A manager’s assessments are compared to those of managers leading similar teams, and they review their employees collectively: A group of five to ten managers meet and project on a wall their fifty to a thousand employees, discuss individuals, and agree on a fair rating. This allows us to remove the pressure managers may feel from employees to inflate ratings. It also ensures that the end results reflect a shared expectation of performance, since managers often have different expectations for their people and interpret performance standards in their own idiosyncratic manner—just like in school, where some teachers were easy graders and others were tough. Calibration diminishes bias by forcing managers to justify their decisions to one another. It also increases perceptions of fairness among employees.117 The power of calibration in assessing people for ratings is not that different from the power of having people compare notes after interviewing candidates. The goal is the same: to remove sources of individual bias. Even if you’re a small company, you’ll have better results, and happier employees, if assessments are based on a group discussion rather than the whims of a single manager.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 144 (location ~ 2208-2217)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A fair process for ratings gets you only so far. As a manager, you want to tell people not only how they did, but also how to do better in the future. The question is: What is the most effective way to deliver those two messages? The answer: Do it in two distinct conversations. Intrinsic motivation is the key to growth, but conventional performance management systems destroy that motivation. Almost everyone wants to improve. Traditional apprenticeship models are based on this notion. An inexperienced worker wants to learn, and will learn best when paired with a more expert partner who teaches them. Remember the first time you rode a bike, or learned to swim, or drove a car? The thrill of mastery, of accomplishment, is a powerful motivator.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 147 (location ~ 2247-2253)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Deci and Ryan concluded that the introduction of an extrinsic reward caused people to think of their work differently from that point on by reducing intrinsic motivation. They went on to demonstrate that intrinsic motivation drives not just higher performance, but also better personal outcomes in terms of greater vitality, self-esteem, and well-being.119 Workplaces that permit employees more freedom tap into that natural intrinsic motivation, which in turn helps employees feel even more autonomous and capable. A similar dynamic exists when managers sit down to give employees their annual review and salary increase. The employees focus on the extrinsic reward—a raise, a higher rating—and learning shuts down. I once had a team member—I’ll call him Sam—who would obsess each quarter about his rating. If it was higher, he didn’t care why he earned the higher rating, or what behaviors he should be doing more of. If it was flat or lower, he would argue about why I didn’t have all the facts and was wrong in my assessment. And Sam would keep arguing until I was so worn down I gave up and assigned him a higher rating. I’m ashamed to admit that, but know that I’m not alone.</em></p>

<p><em>As Prasad Setty explains, “Traditional performance management systems make a big mistake. They combine two things that should be completely separate: performance evaluation and people development. Evaluation is necessary to distribute finite resources, like salary increases or bonus dollars.

<p><em>In 2013, we also experimented with making our peer feedback templates more specific. Prior to that, we’d had the same format for many years: List three to five things the person does well; list three to five things they can do better. Now we asked for one single thing the person should do more of, and one thing they could do differently to have more impact. We reasoned that if people had just one thing to focus on, they’d be more likely to achieve genuine change than if they divided their efforts. We used to ask individuals to list any and all accomplishments from the past year in a single, blank field.

This seems to be related to the dynamic that is seen in classrooms: In general, boys raise their hands and try to answer any question. Girls tend to wait to be certain, even though they are right as often as boys, if not more often.124 We also found that with a small nudge (an email from Alan Eustace to all technical Googlers describing this finding), women then nominate themselves in the same proportion as men.</em></p>

<p><em>Making sure our people are developing is not a luxury. It’s essential for our survival. But the fundamental concepts we’ve had to evolve make up a language that translates to just about any company. First, set goals correctly. Make them public. Make them ambitious. Second, gather peer feedback. There is a range of online tools, not the least of which is Google Sheets, that allows you to create surveys and compile the results. (Type “Google Spreadsheets survey form” into your browser.) People don’t like being labeled, unless they are labeled as extraordinary. But they love useful information that helps them do their jobs better. It’s this latter piece that most companies miss. Every company has some kind of evaluation system that is then used to distribute rewards. Few have equally disciplined mechanisms for development. Third, for evaluation, adopt some kind of calibration process. We prefer meetings where managers sit together and review people as a group. It takes more time, but it gives you a reliable, just process for assessment and decision-making. A side effect is that it’s good for the culture for people to sit together, reconnect, and affirm what we value. In-person meetings are most efficient for companies with up to ten thousand people. After that, you need an awful lot of conference rooms to fit everyone. We keep at it and make it work for more than fifty thousand people because it serves our people well. Fourth, split reward conversations from development conversations. Combining the two kills learning. This holds true at companies of any size.</em></p>

<p><em>What most organizations miss is that people in the bottom tail represent the biggest opportunity to improve performance in your company, and the top tail will teach you exactly how to realize that opportunity. Jack Welch popularized the “up or out” model of management described in the first pages of this book, where General Electric employees were rated each year, and the bottom 10 percent were fired: You either moved up in the organization or you were moved out. But isn’t there a cost to this? It takes time and money to recruit new people, who often are more expensive than current employees and who need to learn the new jobs—and even then may not succeed! In a study of over a thousand research analysts at investment banks, Professor Boris Groysberg of Harvard Business School found that “star analysts suffer an immediate and lasting decline in performance” when they move to a new company.131 Their prior success had been dependent on their coworkers, resources available to them, their fit with the company’s culture, and even the personal reputation or brand they had built up.</em></p>

<p><em>More important is to learn from your best performers.xlvii Every company has the seeds of its future success in its best people, yet most fail to study them closely. This is a missed opportunity, because as Groysberg demonstrates, high performance is highly context dependent. Benchmarking and best practices tell you what worked elsewhere, but not what will work for you. In contrast, understanding precisely what makes your best people succeed in your unique environment is the natural extension of Groysberg’s findings. If success depends on specific, local conditions, then you are best served by studying the interplay of high performance and those local conditions.</em></p>

<p><em>So managers did matter. And not only that, but amazing managers mattered a lot. We now knew who our best and worst managers were, but we didn’t know what they did differently. Our analysis was descriptive but not prescriptive. How could we figure out what the best managers were doing differently from the worst, and how could we then turn that into an engine that would continuously improve the quality of managers at Google? Proving that not all research requires teams of brainiac researchers, we took a very simple approach to finding out what the best and worst managers did differently: We asked them. A sample of managers was interviewed by Googlers who had been given interview guides to follow, but who didn’t know whether the managers they were interviewing were good, bad, or mediocre. This is called a double-blind interview methodology, because it prevents the interviewer from biasing the interviewee, and the interviewee doesn’t know which category they are in either. In other words, both the interviewer and interviewee are “blind” to the experimental condition. Michelle and Neal validated those findings by comparing them to the endorsements written for our Great Manager Award (a program where the best twenty managers are selected based on Googlers’ write-in nominations), to the Googlegeist comments employees made about their managers, and to peer feedback written for managers. They were checking to see if the behaviors the managers claimed were the reasons for their success or struggles were also the behaviors that affected Googlers.</em></p>

<p><em>Simple practice, without feedback and experimentation, is insufficient. I was on my high school’s swim team, and among other events competed in the exhausting 200-yard individual medley: fifty yards each of butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle. I joined because I was faster than my friends, and my uncle had played on the Romanian national water polo team, so I guessed I might have had some natural predisposition. But compared to real swimmers, kids who had been on swim teams since they were six years old and practiced year-round, I was terrible. Between my freshman and senior years, my best times improved by almost 30 percent, but in a typical heat of six swimmers, I’d still have to fight like crazy to come in fifth. Ericsson could have told me right away what my problem was. I showed up to practice twice a day and swam whatever the coach said to swim, but I couldn’t teach myself and was never good enough for the coach to invest even a few minutes in helping me improve my technique. I never experienced deliberate practice. As a result, I got somewhat better, but never had a chance of performing at a high level. In contrast, McKinsey used to send all second-year consultants to their Engagement Leadership Workshop, a one-week session for about fifty people at a time. The seminars ran throughout the year, rotating between Switzerland, Singapore, and the United States. I, of course, was sent to New Jersey. One of the skills we were taught was how to respond to a furious client. First, the instructors gave us the principles (don’t panic, give them time to vent their emotions, etc.), then we role-played the situation, and then we discussed it. Afterward, they gave us a videotape of the role play so we could see exactly what we had done.</em></p>

<p><em>I can’t tell you what to teach your team or organization, since that depends on what your goals are. I can’t tell you whether the best way to teach is in person or remotely, through self-study or group classes. That will depend on how your people learn best, and whether they are trying to learn job-specific skills, such as a new programming language, or more general skills, such as how to work better together as a team. I can, however, tell you exactly where to find the best teachers. They are sitting right next to you. I promise you that in your organization there are people who are expert on every facet of what you do, or at least expert enough that they can teach others. We’re all familiar with the concepts of maximum and minimum. In theory, you want the best person, the one with the maximum expertise, to be delivering training. But in mathematics there’s a more refined concept: the local maximum. The local maximum is the highest value within a more constrained range of values. The largest number is infinity, but the largest number between one and ten is ten. Yo-Yo Ma is considered the best cellist in the world by many. In South Korea, the very gifted Sung-Won Yang is the most prominent cellist. Yang is the local maximum.</em></p>

You don’t even need to pull your best salesperson out of the field to make this work. If you break selling down into discrete skills, there may be different people who are best at cold-calling, negotiation, closing deals, or maintaining relationships. The best at each skill should be teaching it. Former Intel CEO Andy Grove made the same point over thirty years ago: Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform. Consider for a moment the possibility of your putting on a series of four lectures for members of your department. Let’s count on three hours of preparation for each hour of course time—twelve hours of work in total. Say that you have ten students in your class. Next year they will work a total of about twenty thousand hours for your organization. If your training results in a 1 percent improvement in your subordinates’ performance, your company will gain the equivalent of two hundred hours of work as the result of the expenditure of your twelve hours.</em></p>

<p><em>Our spare presentation was so unorthodox that one of our earliest challenges was that users would look at the Google Web page and not type anything. We couldn’t figure out why until we went out and did a user study at a nearby college, actually watching students try to use Google. According to Marissa Mayer, at the time a Googler and now CEO of Yahoo, they were so accustomed to cluttered websites that “flashed, revolved, and asked you to punch the monkey” that they thought there had to be more coming.165 They weren’t searching because they were waiting for the page to finish loading. Engineering vice president Jen Fitzpatrick added: “We wound up sticking a copyright tag at the bottom of the page, not so much because we needed a copyright on the page, but because it was a way to say ‘This is the end.’ ” The copyright notice fixed the problem. Sergey once joked that the reason the Google home page was so empty was that he wasn’t very good at HTML, the programming language used to put up Web pages. According to Jen, the reality was that “It became a point of pride and a point of design intent to not throw lots of distractions at you. Our job was to get you from here to there as laser-fast as we could.” It was a better user experience: fewer distractions, faster load times, and a quicker path to the destination.</em></p>

In addition to offering higher wages, Costco paid 92 percent of the premiums for the 82 percent of employees who had health insurance at the time. Furthermore, 91 percent of employees participated in Costco’s retirement plan, with an average company contribution of $1,330 per employee. Despite this much-higher cost structure, and buoyed by a more affluent customer base and more big-ticket items, Costco generated $21,805 in operating profit per hourly-paid employee compared to $11,615 at Sam’s Club: 55 percent higher wages but 88 percent higher profit. Cascio explained that “In return for its generous wages and benefits, Costco gets one of the most loyal and productive workforces in all of retailing and… the lowest shrinkage (employee theft) figures in the industry.… Costco’s stable, productive workforce more than offsets its higher cost.” I’m now choosing to share some of the most sensitive details of how Google has tackled this most private issue, not to flaunt Google’s success but because we made a bunch of mistakes in how we approached rewarding people. Along the way, we’ve studied pay and fairness and justice and happiness. We’ve learned a bit about how to celebrate success without breeding jealousy. We’ve applied insights from others and proven that what people think will bring them joy may not always be what does.

<p><em>In a misguided attempt to be “fair,” most companies design compensation systems that encourage the best performers and those with the most potential to quit. The first and most critical principle requires you to turn your back on received practice—and it might feel uncomfortable at first. So-called best practices in compensation start with gathering market data for each job and then designing control limits around how much an employee’s individual pay can deviate from market pay and from that of other employees. Typically, companies might allow salaries to vary from market by plus or minus 20 percent, with the absolute best people perhaps 30 percent above market. An average performer might get a 2–3 percent salary increase each year, and an exceptional performer might get 5–10 percent, depending on the company. The perverse result is that if you are an exceptional performer, you will get a series of big increases that then get slower and eventually stop entirely as you approach the upper end of the permissible salary range.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 208 (location ~ 3182-3190)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The problem is that it’s very possible for a person’s contribution to grow far more quickly than her compensation. For example, a top-tier consulting firm might pay a new MBA $100,000 per year, and charge clients $2,000 per day ($500,000 per year), roughly five times her salary. In the second year, the MBA might earn between $120,000 and $150,000 and be billed at $4,000 per day ($1 million a year), about eight times her salary. Independent of whether or not this consultant is creating $1 million of value for her employer or client, her share of the value she’s creating is dropping each year. This is an extreme example, but it’s a pattern that holds in most professional service firms. In fact, economist Edward Lazear of Stanford University has argued that people are on average underpaid relative to their contribution early in their careers, and overpaid later in their careers.169 Internal pay systems don’t move quickly enough or offer enough flexibility to pay the best people what they are actually worth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 209 (location ~ 3200-3207)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fairness is when pay is commensurate with contribution.liv As a result, there ought to be tremendous variance in pay for individuals. Remember Alan Eustace’s argument in chapter 3 that a top-notch engineer is worth three hundred average ones. Bill Gates took a more aggressive view, purportedly saying, “A great lathe operator commands several times the wage of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth 10,000 times the price of an average software writer.” The range of values for software engineers may be broader than for other jobs, but while a great accountant might not be worth a hundred average accountants, he’s surely worth more than three or four of them! But don’t take my word for it. In 1979, Frank Schmidt, of the US Office of Personnel Management, wrote a groundbreaking paper titled “Impact of Valid Selection Procedures on Work-Force Productivity.”170 Schmidt believed, as I’ve argued in chapters 3 and 4, that most hiring processes fail to select truly talented people. He reasoned that if he could prove that hiring better people resulted in real financial returns, then organizations would focus more energy on doing a better job of hiring.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 210 (location ~ 3217-3226)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When rewarding people within our companies, our intuition leads us to make the same mistake that Schmidt made when studying government programmers. We equate the average with the median, assuming that the middle performer is also the average performer. In fact, most performers are below average: 66 percent of researchers are below average in the number of published articles. 84 percent of Emmy-nominated actors are below average in total number of nominations. 68 percent of US representatives are below average in the number of terms they have served. 71 percent of NBA players are below average in the number of points scored. Note that being below average isn’t bad. It’s just the math. As the data show, exceptional contributors perform at a level so far above that of most, that they are able to pull the average up well past the median. The only reason your organization or places like GE have normal performance rating distributions is because HR and management force them to look that way. Companies have expected performance distributions, and raters are trained to hew to them. And that forces pay outcomes to follow the same distribution, which is completely out of line with the value actually created by people.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 213 (location ~ 3266-3277)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course, this doesn’t apply everywhere. As O’Boyle and Aguinis point out, “Industries and organizations that rely on manual labor, have limited technology, and place strict standards for both minimum and maximum production” are places where you’ll see a normal distribution of performance. In those environments there’s little opportunity for exceptional achievement. But everywhere else, this distribution holds sway. How can you tell if you’re in this kind of workplace? Alan gave me a simple test. He asks himself, “How many people would I trade for one Jeff Dean or Sanjay Ghemawat?” Jeff and Sanjay, you’ll remember, invented one of the technologies that made Google and just about every big data company that exists today possible. How many people would you trade for your very best performer? If the number is more than five, you’re probably underpaying your best person. And if it’s more than ten, you’re almost certainly underpaying.</em></p>

<p><em>At Google, we do have situations where two people doing the same work can have a hundred times difference in their impact, and in their rewards. For example, there have been situations where one person received a stock award of $10,000, and another working in the same area received $1,000,000. This isn’t the norm, but the range of rewards at almost any level can easily vary by 300 to 500 percent, and even then there is plenty of room for outliers. In fact, we have many cases where people at more “junior” levels make far more than average performers at more “senior” levels. It’s a natural result of having greater impact, and a compensation system that recognizes that impact. To make these kinds of extreme rewards work, you need two capabilities. One is a very clear understanding of what impact is derived from the role in question (which requires a complementary awareness of how much is due to context: Did the market move in a lucky way? How much of this was a result of a team effort or the brand of the company? Is the achievement a short- or long-term win?). Once you can assess impact, you can look at your available budget and decide what the shape of your reward curve ought to be. If the best performer is generating ten times as much impact as an average performer, they shouldn’t necessarily get ten times the reward, but I’d wager they should get at least five times the reward.180 If you’re adopting a system like this, the only way to stay within budget is to give smaller rewards to the poorer performers, or even the average ones. That won’t feel good initially, but take comfort in knowing that you’ve now given your best people a reason to stay with you, and everyone else a reason to aim higher.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 215 (location ~ 3291-3303)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The other capability is having managers who understand the reward system well enough that they can explain to the recipient, and to others who might ask if word were to get out, exactly why a reward was so high and what any employee can do to achieve a similar reward. In other words, the allocation of extreme awards must be just. If you can’t explain to employees the basis for such a wide range of awards, and can’t give them specific ways to improve their own performance to these superb levels, you will breed a culture of jealousy and resentment. Maybe that’s why most companies don’t bother. It’s hard work to have pay ranges where someone can make two or even ten times more than someone else. But it’s much harder to watch your highest-potential and best people walk out the door. It makes you wonder which companies are really paying unfairly: the ones where the best people make far more than average, or the ones where everyone is paid the same.</em></p>

Team members receive awards based on their level of involvement and contribution, and the largest awards to individuals can reach several million dollars.… Like a small start-up, Google will provide substantial upside to our employees based on their accomplishments.

So, do the shortcomings of this program contradict my earlier advice to pay exceptional people exceptionally well? Actually, no. You should absolutely provide exceptional rewards. But you should do it in a way that’s just. The error we made in our Founders’ Awards was that we were celebrating money, even though we didn’t mean to.

<p><em>It’s essential that extreme reward systems have both distributive and procedural justice. Recognizing this, or more precisely, having learned this lesson the hard way, we revamped our reward programs. We decided that our public, top-down reward programs would truly be open to the entire company. Rather than just asking our technical leaders for nominations, we turned to our heads of sales, finance, public relations, and other nontechnical departments and encouraged them to nominate teams. We also shifted these programs from providing monetary awards to experiential awards. This was a profound change for the better. People think about experiences and goods differently than about monetary awards. Cash is evaluated on a cognitive level. A cash award is valued by calculating how it compares to your current salary, or to what you could buy with it. Is it as big as a paycheck or smaller? Can it buy a cellphone or will it help me get a new car? And because money is fungible, as often as not it’s spent on staples rather than splurging on a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes or a massage, and fades from memory. Non-cash awards, whether they are experiences (a dinner for two) or gifts (a Nexus 7 tablet), trigger an emotional response. Recipients focus on the fact of what they get to experience, rather than calculating values.</em></p>

<p><em>The result was astounding. Despite telling us they would prefer cash over experiences, the experimental group was happier. Much happier. They thought their awards were 28 percent more fun, 28 percent more memorable, and 15 percent more thoughtful. This was true whether the experience was a team trip to Disneyland (it turns out most adults are still kids on the inside) or individual vouchers to do something on their own. And they stayed happier for a longer period of time than Googlers who received money. When resurveyed five months later, the cash recipients’ levels of happiness with their awards had dropped by about 25 percent. The experimental group was even happier about the award than when they received it. The joy of money is fleeting, but memories last forever.187 We still make exceptional cash and stock awards for exceptional people. And our annual bonus and stock grant awards follow more of a power law distribution. But over the past ten years we’ve learned that how you determine those awards is as important as how much you award. Programs that failed tests of distributive or procedural justice have been replaced or been improved. We’ve added a strong emphasis on accumulating experiences, rather than just money. We recognize publicly through experiential awards and reward privately through substantial differentiation in bonus and stock. And Googlers are happier as a result.</em></p>

That said, the underlying notion that performance follows a power law distribution would have been true at almost any place I’ve worked, whether it was at a public school, a charitable nonprofit, a restaurant, or in consulting. In every environment, there were more exceptional people than you would expect based on normal performance management curves. And the exceptional people were clearly, obviously, far better than everyone else. Teachers who won awards every year, fund-raisers who brought in three times as much as the next person, waiters who would (maddeningly) get twice the tips I did every single night. And they were always paid “fairly,” which meant they couldn’t earn too much more than the average performers because the average performers might get offended. The truth was, we could all see how much better they were, and how much more they deserved. If your best person is worth ten of the average people, you must pay “unfairly.” Otherwise, you’re just giving them a reason to quit.</em></p>

<p><em>Take Your Parents to Work Day isn’t about humoring helicopter parents who continue to coddle their fully grown children. Instead, it’s a chance for us to say thank you and broaden the Google family. Not surprisingly, our parents are incredibly proud of us and, surprisingly, most of them have no idea what we do for a living. Helping them appreciate the impact their children have, even when those children are fifty years old, is heartwarming. I was stopped a dozen times by parents with tears in their eyes, delighted at the chance to get closer to their children, and grateful to be recognized for having raised such amazing people. The Googlers loved it too. Tom Johnson wrote that “Thinking about taking [my mother] around the place I am so proud to work [at] and seeing how happy she was to spend the time with me brings a wide smile to my face every time.” It was my favorite day at Google ever.</em></p>

There’s a series of Sum of Google conferences and events, ranging from potluck dinners and movie nights to career talks and volunteer projects, premised on the idea that many of these groups have common ground in what they experience in society. Other noteworthy groups include our fifty-two Culture Clubs, which in addition to keeping our culture strong in each office, organize events that both bring Googlers together and forge deeper connections with people outside Google.</em></p>

<p><em>Ronald Burt, a sociologist at the University of Chicago, has shown that innovation tends to occur in the structural holes between social groups. These could be the gaps between business functional units, teams that tend not to interact, or even the quiet person at the end of the conference table who never says anything. Burt has a delicious way of putting it: “People who stand near the holes in a social structure are at higher risk of having good ideas.”196 People with tight social networks, like those in a business unit or team, often have similar ideas and ways of looking at problems. Over time, creativity dies. But the handful of people who operate in the overlapping space between groups tend to come up with better ideas. And often, they’re not even original. They are an application of an idea from one group to a new group.</em></p>

Super annoying. Why wouldn’t we throw a few machines and detergent in a spare room on our campus to make life a little more pleasant? Why wouldn’t we have speakers come on campus and give talks? After all, I get to enjoy those presentations as well.

<p><em>In 2011 we decided that if the unthinkable happened, the surviving partner should immediately receive the value of all the Googler’s unvested stock. We also decided to continue paying 50 percent of the Googler’s salary to the survivor for the next ten years. And if there were children, the family would receive an additional $1,000 each month until they turned nineteen, or twenty-three if they were full-time students. We didn’t tell anyone about the change, not even Googlers. It would have been a pretty macabre thing to advertise. We didn’t think of it as a way to attract or retain people. There was no business benefit at all. It was just the right thing to do. Eighteen months later, I realized I’d made a mistake. I was being interviewed by journalist Meghan Casserly for an article in Forbes magazine and I let slip that we offered this benefit. She immediately realized what a big deal this was, and published an article with the eye-catching title, “Here’s What Happens to Google Employees When They Die.”200 The response was enormous and the article was quickly viewed almost half a million times. Once word was out, I immediately heard from my peers at other companies. The number one question was, “Doesn’t that cost a fortune?” Not even close. Our cost thus far has been running at about one-tenth of one percent of payroll. Put another way, the average US company spends 4 percent a year on salary increases: roughly 3 percent for annual increases and 1 percent for promotions. I bet if you asked any employee if they’d want a program like this at the price of getting a 2.9 percent raise instead of a 3.0 percent raise, almost all would say yes.</em></p>

<p><em>In 2011 we also changed our maternity leave policies. We decided to provide five months of maternity leave in the United States at a time when three months was more typical. But we made a more profound change as well. We decided that new parents would receive their full salary, bonus, and stock vesting for the entire time they were on leave. And any new parents receive a $500 bonus to help make life a bit easier by, for example, ordering home delivery of meals for the first few weeks. By now, you’d guess that this was a data-driven decision, based on a detailed analysis of Googler happiness, retention, and the costs of the program—the kind of decision I’ve been advising you to make. But, like the death benefits, we made this call based on instinct. I was driving to work one day and thinking about the developmental differences between a three- and a five-month-old infant. I’m not an expert by any means, but I remember watching my own children grow. It is in the later months that babies start responding more to interaction, and new parents stop panicking at every cough and sneeze and realize that things are probably going to turn out okay. When I got to work, I said “Let’s make the change.” Only later did I look at the data.</em></p>

After making the change in leave, the difference in attrition rates vanished. And moms told us that they were often using the extra two months to transition slowly back to work, making them more effective and happier when the leave ended. When we eventually did the math, it turned out this program cost nothing. The cost of having a mom out of the office for an extra couple of months was more than offset by the value of retaining her expertise and avoiding the cost of finding and training a new hire.</em></p>

Both cities are similarly cosmopolitan; it doesn’t seem that those in London would be any less interested in art or the rain; and the wait times weren’t different. So what was? The exhibit was free in London, but it cost $25 in New York.206 Complementary to what we saw in chapter 7—where professors Deci and Ryan saw intrinsic motivation and productivity drop once they started paying people to perform tasks—once you charge for something, people think about it differently. They want to “get their money’s worth.” Without meaning to, and despite requesting that people limit the length of their visits, the Museum of Modern Art instituted an incentive system that caused exactly the behavior they hoped to avoid.</em></p>

<p><em>In their book Nudge, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein, professors at the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School, document at length how an awareness of the flaws in our brains can be used to improve our lives. They define a nudge as “any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people’s behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives.… To count as a mere nudge, the intervention must be easy and cheap to avoid. Nudges are not mandates. Putting the fruit at eye level counts as a nudge. Banning junk food does not.”209 In other words, nudges are about influencing choice, not dictating it. Some argue that nudges are unethical, forcing people into choices they would not otherwise make or want. But opponents of nudging ignore the reality that someone first made a choice not to put the fruit at eye level. Scottish philosopher David Hume described this problem, referred to as the “is-ought” fallacy or as Hume’s Guillotine (because it severs the connection between “is” and “ought”). Just because something is done a certain way today, doesn’t mean it ought to be done that way. In fact, many nudges are changes to poorly chosen current conditions that result in less health, wealth, or happiness.</em></p>

<p><em>For example, grocers place the most essential and perishable products like milk at the farthest end of the store, requiring us to traverse the well-stocked aisles at every visit. And they put high-margin, impulse-purchase items like candy bars at the checkout—even though you can purchase the same items elsewhere in the store—because that causes us to buy more candy bars. Would it be wrong or evil for them to instead put fruit by the registers? It would surely be less profitable, but it would just as surely be healthier for their shoppers. The purpose of grocery stores is not to improve their shoppers’ welfare, however. It is to make money. Harsh, perhaps, but without profits a grocery ceases to exist. Even an all-organic neighborhood co-op grocer has to make enough revenue this month to pay salaries and rent, and buy inventory for next month. So I can’t blame my local co-op for putting the three-dollar, organic, honey-sweetened, hand-churned peanut butter cup by the checkout. But I’d be healthier if I grabbed an apple to munch on instead of a candy bar. Even if you accept that nudges can improve welfare, and you recognize that there’s no reason to hold the status quo sacrosanct, there’s still something we find unsavory about management’s icy decision to manipulate employees through nudges. In a way, it’s more comforting to know that the awful cube farms we live in are a result of simple ignorance or poor planning than to recognize that Bloomberg’s bullpen was a calculated attempt to manipulate his teams into being more open and collaborative. How dare my facilities department/boss/government try to trick me!</em></p>

<p><em>I suspect there are two reasons why nudges give some people the heebie-jeebies. First, the specter of lab coat–clad brainiacs secretly influencing us is unsettling. But nudges don’t need to be secret. At Google we believe in transparency as one of our cultural cornerstones. We typically don’t tell Googlers about our experiments as they are running, since that can change their behavior. After the experiment, however, we share what we found and how we intend to go forward. Second, people don’t like being reminded of the limits of our free will. Nudges raise all kinds of questions about desire (“Do I want a new Escalade because I need it, or because GM spent $3,100,000,000212 on advertising in 2012?”),lx about choice (Coke had 17 percent of the US market in 2012, compared to 9 percent for Pepsi,213 even though one study using MRI scans showed that people found it hard to tell the difference),214 and even about identity (“If the choices I make are a product of my environment and history, are any of my choices truly free?”). These are deep, deep questions, far beyond the scope of this book. But defensiveness is a natural reaction to being confronted with a threat to one’s self-conception and identity.</em></p>

<p><em>A sense of humanity compels us to be thoughtful, compassionate, and above all transparent when deploying nudges. The goal is not to supplant decision-making, but to replace thoughtlessly or poorly designed environments with structures that improve health and wealth without limiting freedom. Our guiding principle? Nudges aren’t shoves. Even the gentlest of reminders can make a difference. A nudge doesn’t have to be expensive or elaborate. It only needs to be timely, relevant, and simple to put into action. Much of our work in this area falls under a program called Optimize Your Life, which is led by Yvonne Agyei in partnership with Prasad Setty (People Operations), Dave Radcliffe (Workplace Services—he runs the shuttles and cafés, for example), and all of their teams. And Googlers, of course, are a great source of ideas and inspiration too.</em></p>

<p><em>In the pilot, managers received just-in-time emails the Sunday before a new hire started. Like the Project Oxygen checklist, which showcased the eight behaviors of successful managers, the five actions were almost embarrassing in their simplicity: Have a role-and-responsibilities discussion. Match your Noogler with a peer buddy. Help your Noogler build a social network. Set up onboarding check-ins once a month for your Noogler’s first six months. Encourage open dialogue. And as with Project Oxygen, we saw a substantial improvement. Nooglers whose managers took action on this email became fully effective 25 percent faster than their peers, saving a full month of learning time. I was shocked at how profound the result was.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>The remaining four checklist items followed a similar format. Significantly, they were all about helping the Noogler build a support network and developing a norm of clear communication. All the detail made the email a page and a half long, which we figured was the most we could expect someone to read. And it worked beautifully. So that covered the managers of new hires, but what about the new hires themselves? Research on how people join teams and companies shows that some employees don’t sit idly by, waiting for someone to “onboard them.” Rather, they onboard themselves by reaching out to coworkers, seeking out resources, asking questions, and setting up lunches to build their networks. People who demonstrate this scrappy, proactive behavior become fully effective faster and perform better on tests of acculturation.</em></p>

<p><em>So what were the results of this nudging experiment? Nooglers who got the nudge were more likely to ask for feedback, became productive faster, and tended to have a more accurate sense of their own performance than a control group. But the subset of people who needed it most—those who were less naturally proactive—scored 15 points higher on measures of engaging in proactive behaviors during their first month than did others.</em></p>

<p><em>Another challenge we had was that Googlers would often sign up for learning courses and then fail to attend. In the first half of 2012, we had a 30 percent no-show rate, which prevented Googlers on the waitlist from taking courses and caused us to run half-empty classes. We tried four different email nudges, ranging from appealing to our desire to avoid harming others (showing photos of people on the waitlist so enrollees could see who would be harmed by a no-show) to relying on identity consistency (reminding enrollees to be “Googley” and do the right thing). The nudges had the dual effect of reducing no-shows and increasing the rate at which people canceled their slots in advance, which allowed us to offer them to other Googlers. The effects of each nudge were different, however. Showing the photos of waitlisted enrollees increased attendance by 10 percent but did less to encourage unenrollment. Appeals to identity had the greatest effect on unenrollment, increasing it by 7 percent. Since then, we’ve incorporated these nudges into all course reminders and seen better attendance and shorter waitlists. Nudges have proven helpful in changing norms at Google as well. Given how much information we share inside the company, controlling access to our buildings is critical. It’s also not unheard-of in Silicon Valley for people to sneak into buildings to steal laptops and electronics, or even to try to get access to a company’s systems.</em></p>

<p><em>What we didn’t expect was that every one of these emails would trigger a reaction. Twenty-seven percent of Googlers receiving an email changed their contribution rates, and the average savings rate increased to 11.5 percent from 8.7 percent, regardless of which email someone received. Assuming an 8 percent annual return, this one year of contribution will add a total of $32 million to these Googlers’ retirement funds. Assuming they continue at Google and keep contributing at that rate each year, every one of these Googlers will retire with an additional $262,000 in their 401(k)s. Even better, the people with the lowest savings rates increased the most, averaging a 60 percent higher increase than those in the control group. As one Googler wrote, “Thank you! I had no idea I was putting so little away!” Each year since, we have continued to send out nudges, constantly tweaking them to further increase Googler savings. And each year, Googlers save more. The nudge itself is cheap, though it results in greater expenditures for us as we continue to match retirement contributions. That said, it’s money I’m delighted to spend.</em></p>

<p><em>Another reason I’m emphasizing food is that diet is one of the biggest controllable factors that affect health and longevity in the United States. More than one-third of adults are obese, which the Centers for Disease Control define as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher,235 and require almost $150 billion in medical services each year.236 Including those who are overweight (BMI between 25 and 29.9) brings the total to 69 percent of Americans. BMI is a measure of the relationship between your weight and your height. It’s not a perfect measure by any means. For example, people with higher than average muscle development can have BMIs that suggest they are overweight, when in reality muscle is denser than other bodily tissues. But it’s a simple-to-calculate starting point. BMI calculators are easy to find online if you want to check yours. Managing your health, and your weight in particular, has all the hallmarks of an impossible task. The results are slow to appear and difficult to observe, so you get little positive feedback. It requires sustained willpower, which we all have in only limited supply.</em></p>

<p><em>We decided to test three types of intervention:lxvi providing information so that people could make better food choices, limiting options to healthy choices, and nudging. Of the three, nudges were the most effective. One study tested whether shocking signage would reduce consumption of sugary beverages. It was inspired by the work of Professor David Hammond of the University of Waterloo, Canada.238 Starting in December 2000, Canadian cigarette packs were required to bear health warnings accompanied by graphic illustrations and blunt text about the risks of smoking, as can be seen in the side label. Hammond surveyed 432 smokers about the effect of the labels on their smoking habits over a three-month period. Nineteen percent reported smoking less as a result of the warnings. Those smokers who experienced fear (44 percent) or disgust (58 percent) in looking at the labels were much more likely to have reduced the amount they smoked and increased their likelihood of quitting.</em></p>

<li>Page 279 (location ~ 4273-4281)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If information by itself was insufficient, what if we reduced the range of options to include only healthy choices? I suspect it’s this kind of approach that is feared by those who oppose nudging. Reducing choice also ran counter to our democratic impulses, but we wanted to be responsive to Googlers who were enthusiastic about getting people healthier, now. Reducing options didn’t work so well. Our “Meatless Monday” pilot stopped serving land-based meat in two cafés on Mondays for one month. Attendance at one of the cafés dropped off, and the primary reason people gave for avoiding it was that they didn’t like having choices made for them. As we’ll discuss in the next chapter, there were much, much stronger reactions as well. Googlers also told us they valued options. Fifty-eight percent of the comments across six microkitchen-based studies were supportive of more healthy food only if it was in addition to existing offerings. Googlers were willing to eat healthier, but not at the expense of choice.</em></p>

<p><em>Rather than take away sweets, we put the healthier snacks on open counters and at eye and hand level to make them more accessible and appealing. And we moved the more indulgent snacks lower on our shelves and placed them in opaque containers. In our Boulder, Colorado, office we measured the consumption of microkitchen snacks for two weeks to generate a baseline, and then put all the candy in opaque containers. Though the containers were labeled, it wasn’t possible to see the brightly colored wrappers. Googlers, being normal people, prefer candy to fruit, but what would happen when we made the candy just a little less visible and harder to get to? We were floored by the result. The proportion of total calories consumed from candy decreased by 30 percent and the proportion of fat consumed dropped by 40 percent as people opted for the more visible granola bars, chips, and fruit. Heartened by the result, we did the same thing in our New York office, home to over two thousand Googlers. Healthy snacks like dried fruit and nuts were put in glass containers, and sweets were hidden in colored containers. After seven weeks, Googlers in our New York office had eaten 3.1 million (3,100,000!) fewer calories—enough to avoid gaining a cumulative 885 pounds.</em></p>

<p><em>Design deliberately and with intent Nudges are an incredibly powerful mechanism for improving teams and organizations. They are also ideally suited to experimentation, so can be tested on smaller populations to fine-tune their results. Prime Minister David Cameron of the United Kingdom established a “nudge unit” in 2010 that has improved collection of car taxes by 30 percent by sending overdue-tax notices along with a bold “Pay your tax or lose your [make of car]” label and a photo of the car. The unit also improved collection of court fines by 33 percent by sending notices by text message instead of mail. And in 2011 they replaced an attic insulation subsidy with an attic-clearing subsidy, with discounted rates for cleaning out clutter if insulation was subsequently installed. This cost people more, but the rate of adoption tripled.244 Up to 60 percent of people who are prescribed physical rehabilitation fail to complete their program or to fully comply with the rehabilitation protocols, according to Britton Brewer of Springfield College.245 A Bay Area physical therapy center, PhysioFit, appears to see a substantially larger compliance rate. What do they do differently? They send a text message to all new patients: “PhysioFit Physical Therapy and Wellness offers text reminders. Reply with ‘Y’ to sign up.” The patient receives a text reminder for their appointments, as well as a daily reminder to perform their at-home therapy. Simple, free, and effective.</em></p>

The data were pretty clear. Aside from a few notable examples, like Intel Capital, most corporate venture-capital efforts were failures. They lacked the expertise, clarity of purpose, and physical proximity to where the most lucrative deals were being hatched. I told the senior partner it was a bad idea. I showed him the data. I explained that there were almost no examples of these kinds of efforts being successful, and none that I could find that were thousands of miles outside of Silicon Valley and run by people who lacked any engineering background. He told me that the client was asking how to set it up, not whether to set it up, and that I should focus on answering the client’s question. Perhaps he was right. Or perhaps he had some superior insight into the issue that trumped my data. Maybe he’d already made that argument to the client, and they’d rejected it. But to me it felt like I’d failed. I thought the obligation to dissent required me to speak up, so it was all the more gut-wrenching to see my concerns brushed aside.

The room was filled with hundreds of Googlers, and thirty or forty Nooglers capping off their first week at Google. I was among the Nooglers, and none of us expected what came next. “These blueprints were leaked outside of the company. We found the person who leaked them. And he has been fired.” We believe we work better as a company if everyone can find out what everyone else is doing, Eric explained, which is why we share so much information among ourselves before any of it is publicly known. And it’s why he was sharing the blueprints with everyone that day. He declared that he trusted all of us to keep information confidential.

<p><em>Meatless Monday, which I mentioned in the last chapter, is an initiative sponsored by the Monday Campaigns in association with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It encourages people to avoid meat on Mondays as a way to improve their health and consume foods that require fewer resources to raise. For September of 2010, two of our twenty-plus cafés stopped serving land-based meat on Mondays, though they still served fish. We tracked café attendance on those days in September and compared it to August, and surveyed Googlers in the two Meatless Monday cafés, two control cafés, and online. Some people thought going vegetarian was great. Some didn’t. A vocal subset of Googlers in our Mountain View office were livid, sparking a lively set of discussions and holding a protest barbecue. The outrage was in part a reaction to more limited choice in those cafés, and in part a reaction to the perception that Google was mandating a certain ethos: that meat consumption was unhealthy. There was nothing wrong with the protest barbecue. It was funny, clever, and a pointed critique. In a wry twist, at least one “protester” had asked a chef if they could not only borrow a barbecue but also have some meat to cook. And, of course, our headquarters in Mountain View, California, are just across the highway from an In-N-Out Burger and a host of restaurants, so there were ample meat-laden choices if you were willing to pay for your own lunch. At the end of the month, we asked for feedback on Meatless Mondays. The complaints of the entitled few reached a crescendo, and I stood onstage at TGIF to share what we’d seen. I told Googlers about people ransacking the microkitchens, about the way our hardworking kitchen staff were being treated by a few petulant people, about the Googler who was throwing forks away. And I shared a piece of anonymous feedback that a Googler had written:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 291 (location ~ 4449-4463)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stop trying to tell me how to live my life. If you don’t want to provide us the traditional food benefit then shut all the cafés down.… Seriously stop this sh</em>* or I’ll go to Microsoft, Twitter or Facebook where they don’t f*** with us.*</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 292 (location ~ 4463-4465)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The silent majority of Googlers, who had been unaware that this was happening, were appalled. They soon weighed in by the hundreds via email, at TGIF, and with private notes of thanks and support to our café team. Among them too were voices that wisely reminded us to assume good intent and be mindful of witch hunts. Even the person who was throwing away forks clarified that she of course hadn’t meant that literally. Of course. No one was fired, but the level of abuse and entitlement fell away. The mores had shifted. A system like ours, which relies on people to be good and provides benefit of the doubt, is susceptible to bad actors. My very public statement, underscored by the appalling words of a fellow employee, made transparent what was happening and made it socially acceptable for Googlers to nudge one another. Snatching four takeout boxes at once was now greeted with a gentle “You must be pretty hungry,” and people stockpiling snacks on Fridays were looked at askance.</em></p>

<p><em>Each time we make changes to Google’s performance management system, two truths become self-evident: No one likes the system. No one likes the proposed change to the current system. We used to start our annual performance review process in December. It was a hearty undertaking: Everyone in the company received peer and manager feedback, performance ratings were assigned and calibrated across groups of managers, and it concluded with determining bonuses. Our sales teams didn’t like the timing. December was the last month of the last quarter of each year, when they were striving to finish deals. Other Googlers hated the timing too. They—quite reasonably—didn’t want to spend time over the holidays writing reviews. We asked ourselves, Why do we need to have reviews at year-end anyway? The timing didn’t seem to work for anyone, and it smacked of “convention” in precisely the way that made Googlers want to reject it. We decided to move the annual reviews to March, well clear of the year-end crunch. I tested the idea with our management group, who, after some discussion, were supportive. The People Operations team worked it through with their clients, who were also supportive.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 293 (location ~ 4486-4496)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I emailed managers that rather than push reviews into March, we would start them in October. That both took pressure off the very end of the year and allowed detailed reviews to happen before bonus planning. Because there would be a gap between the end of reviews and bonus planning, we gave managers the freedom to adjust ratings in extreme cases if Googlers’ performance trajectory changed materially. Superficially, it looked like a vocal group of Googlers had shifted the result for the whole company. In reality, we ended up with a better solution precisely because Googlers were vocal. It wasn’t easy to change direction publicly in front of thousands of people, but it was the right thing to do. The experience underscored not just the importance of listening to our people, but also the need to have a reliable channel for opinions well before decisions are made. We eventually assembled a group we call the Canaries, engineers of varying seniorities, selected based on their ability to both represent the views of the various constituencies within engineering and credibly communicate how and why decisions were made. The group is named for the nineteenth-century mining practice of bringing canaries into coal mines to detect accumulations of toxic gases. Canaries, being more sensitive to the buildup of methane and carbon dioxide, would suffocate long before miners would. A dead canary meant it was time to evacuate. Similarly, our canaries give us an early warning about how engineers will react, and are trusted partners and advisors in shaping our people programs.</em></p>

<p><em>Remember Google Lively? The product where you could create an animated avatar of yourself online and meet other people in simulated buildings and rooms? Surely you remember Google Audio Ads, radio ads that were delivered by Google? Or Google Answers, where you could post a question, offering a bounty to anyone who answered it to your satisfaction? These products were discontinued between 2006 and 2009. They were among the more than 250 products Google has launched over the past fifteen years, most of which not even I have heard of. A side effect of untrammeled freedom is a flood of ideas. In addition to hundreds of products, we had a project database, where Googlers would log the thousands of 20-percent-time projects that had been started. We had an ideas board, where more than twenty thousand ideas were posted and discussed.</em></p>

<p><em>Behind the scenes, more was going on. Larry had pulled together the top two hundred or so leaders in the company and explained that we were trying to do too many things at the same time, and as a result weren’t doing any of them as well as we could. He began leading an annual spring cleaning, shutting down products that weren’t gaining traction (like Google Health, a site for storing your health information), were being done better by others (such as Knol, an attempt at an online encyclopedia), or had simply ceased to be relevant (Google Desktop, a product you could download to better search your computer’s content, which became less relevant as most operating systems incorporated their own desktop search technologies). None of these shutdowns were easy, as every product had fans, champions, and people working on them. Some wondered whether this new “top-down” focus on deciding which products live or die meant that our values had changed.</em></p>

<p><em>In fact, we’d rediscovered a principle we knew to be true in our earliest days: Innovation thrives on creativity and experimentation, but it also requires thoughtful pruning. With tens of thousands of employees and billions of users, there are infinite opportunities to create. And we attract people who want to do just that. But freedom is not absolute, and being part of a team, an organization, means that on some level you’ve agreed to give up some small measure of personal freedom in exchange for the promise of accomplishing more together than you could alone.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 298 (location ~ 4556-4560)</li>

<p><em>The key to balancing individual freedom with overall direction is to be transparent. People need to understand the rationales behind each action that might otherwise be viewed as a step down the slippery slope that leads you away from your values. And the more central your values are to how you operate, the more you need to explain. As important as explaining each decision is explaining the broader context. In October of 2013, a Googler asked me whether the annual product shutdowns were a sign that we cared less about individual ideas. I told him that the pendulum of letting one thousand flowers bloom253, of fertilizing every idea, had swung too far and we were failing to make as much progress as our users deserved. Our product portfolio, like any garden, required regular, judicious pinching back. And in doing so, we would make our company healthier.</em></p>

<p><em>On that particular day in April, a chef decided to make a pie using goji berries that were from Tibet. All food at Google is free. So it was a free pie. With goji berries. From Tibet. But for many Googlers, that was very different from a “Free Tibet goji-chocolate crème pie.” Google operates around the world, and we have several offices in mainland China. For many mainland Chinese, Tibet was, is, and should always be a part of China. For many others, Tibet was and should be an independent nation. Stepping back from Google, I’m probably not taking too much literary license to say that there are probably a billion people who hold one view, and a billion who hold the other view. There were Googlers, like the one who emailed Eric and a few thousand of his closest friends, who were deeply offended by the implied notion in the pastry’s name that Tibet should be “free.” To make the point, some suggested that Westerners would be equally offended if “some chef in London” had offered “Free Wales pie” or a “Free Northern Ireland cookie.” Others went so far as to suggest “Free Quebec maple syrup,” “Texas polygamy steaks,” and “War of Northern Aggression hotcakes.”</em></p>

<p><em>I realized that these kinds of enormous, brawling, wildly inconclusive debates are part of a culture of transparency and voice. Not every problem can be resolved with data. Reasonable people can look at the same set of facts and disagree, particularly where values are concerned. But the Googlers who wondered if penalizing the chef would chill speech at the company were on to something. The name of a dessert doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. But if Googlers felt that they could be penalized for something as relatively trivial as this, then how could they ever be expected to ask our CEO the hard questions about whether we were staying true to our mission or putting users first? People knew they were free to have the conversation. And as painful as it is to live through, these debates are signs that you’re getting something right. Actually, one thing was resolved. I dug into the chef’s suspension, and reversed it. He came back to work the next day. His intentions were good and no harm was done. His manager overreacted, which was understandable in the face of hundreds of emails. I announced this in one of the last responses to the thread, and received more than two dozen notes thanking me, and management, for doing the right thing. The debate was important. And sparking a debate should never be a crime.</em></p>

<p><em>Work is far less meaningful and pleasant than it needs to be because well-intentioned leaders don’t believe, on a primal level, that people are good. Organizations build immense bureaucracies to control their people. These control structures are an admission that people can’t be trusted. Or at best, they suggest that one’s baser nature can be controlled and channeled by some enlightened figure with the wisdom to know what is best. That the nature of man is bad, and must be forged through rules, rewards, and punishments. Jonathan Edwards, an American preacher who played a key role in the 1730s religious revival known as the Great Awakening, wrote a sermon that encapsulated this philosophy. It chilled me when I first read it in my high school literature class: Natural Men are held in the Hand of God over the Pit of Hell; they have deserved the fiery Pit, and are already sentenced to it.… [T]he Fire pent up in their own Hearts is struggling to break out… [and] there are no Means within Reach that can be any Security to them.</em></p>

<p><em>Steven Pinker, in The Better Angels of Our Nature, argues that the world has become a better place over time, at least when measured by incidences of violence. In the pre-state, hunter-gatherer era, 15 percent of people died violently, declining to 3 percent in the early Roman, British, and Islamic empires. By the twentieth century, homicide in European countries had dropped by another order of magnitude. Today, rates of violent death are even lower. Pinker explains that “human nature has always comprised inclinations toward violence and inclinations that counteract them—such as self-control, empathy, fairness and reason.… Violence has declined because historical circumstances have increasingly favored our better angels.”256 States expanded and consolidated, reducing the risk of tribal and regional conflict. People built bonds with one another through trade that made going to war ever more irrational. “Cosmopolitanism—the expansion of people’s parochial little worlds through literacy, mobility, education, science, history, journalism and mass media… prompt[ed] people to take the perspective of people unlike themselves and to expand their circle of sympathy to embrace them.” Pinker lives in a world vastly different from that of Edwards. The world is more interconnected and interdependent. Yet our management practices remain mired in the mindset of Edwards and of Frederick Winslow Taylor, who told Congress in 1912 that management needs to tightly control workers, who were too feeble-minded to think for themselves: I can say, without the slightest hesitation, that the science of handling pig iron is so great that the man who is… physically able to handle pig iron and is sufficiently phlegmatic and stupid to choose this for his occupation is rarely able to comprehend the science of handling pig iron.</em></p>

<p><em>The good news is any team can be built around the principles that Google has used. Throughout this book I’ve offered short lists of “work rules” in each chapter, in case you want to focus on one area or another. But if you want to become a high-freedom environment, here are the ten steps that will transform your team or workplace: Give your work meaning. Trust your people. Hire only people who are better than you. Don’t confuse development with managing performance. Focus on the two tails. Be frugal and generous. Pay unfairly. Nudge. Manage the rising expectations. Enjoy! And then go back to No. 1 and start again.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 307 (location ~ 4702-4711)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>1. Give your work meaning Work consumes at least one-third of your life, and half your waking hours. It can and ought to be more than a means to an end. Nonprofit organizations have long tapped meaning as a way of attracting and motivating people.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 308 (location ~ 4712-4714)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>2. Trust your people If you believe human beings are fundamentally good, act like it. Be transparent and honest with your people, and give them a voice in how things work. It’s fine to start small. Indeed, the less trust you have been showing, the more meaningful the smallest gestures will feel. For a company with a history of opaque management, a suggestion box that employees know is read and attended to will feel revolutionary. Let your teams ask you what motivated your latest decisions. If you’re a small shop, regularly ask your employees what they would change to make things better, or what they would change if it was their company. Because that’s how you want them to behave. As if it were their company. And the only way for that to happen is if you give up a little bit of your authority, giving them space to grow into it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 309 (location ~ 4724-4731)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>3. Hire only people who are better than you Organizations often act as if filling jobs quickly is more important than filling jobs with the best people. I’ve had salespeople tell me “Bad breath is better than no breath,” meaning that they’d rather have the revenue that comes from a mediocre performer in a territory hitting 70 percent of their sales quota than have the territory empty. But it is an error ever to compromise on hiring quality. A bad hire is toxic, not only destroying their own performance, but also dragging down the performance, morale, and energy of those around them. If being down a person means everyone else has to work harder in the short term, just remind them of the last jerk they had to work with. Hire by committee, set objective standards in advance, never compromise, and periodically check if your new hires are better than your old ones.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 309 (location ~ 4736-4743)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>4. Don’t confuse development with managing performance Chris Argyris showed us how even the most successful people fail to learn. And if they can’t learn, what hope is there for the rest of us? It’s simply not pleasant to confront your own weaknesses. If you marry criticism with consequence, if people feel that a miss means that they will be hurt professionally or economically, they will argue instead of being open to learning and growing. Make developmental conversations safe and productive by having them all the time, just like my manager used to do when we’d leave every meeting. Always start with an attitude of “How can I help you be more successful?” Otherwise, defenses go up and learning shuts down.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 310 (location ~ 4746-4751)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>5. Focus on the two tails Put your best people under a microscope. Through a combination of circumstance, skill, and grit they have figured out how to excel. Identify not just your best all-around athletes, but the best specialists. Don’t find the best salesperson; find the person who sells best to new accounts of a certain size. Find the person who excels at hitting golf balls at night in the rain. The more specific you can be in slicing expertise, the easier it will be to study your stars and discern why they are more successful than others. And then use them not just as exemplars for others by building checklists around what they do, but also as teachers. One of the best ways to learn a skill is to teach it. Enlisting stars as faculty, even if it’s just for a thirty-minute coffee talk, will force them to articulate how they do what they do, and this very process helps them grow as well. If you’re exposed to one of these people as a coworker, observe them closely, pepper them with questions, and use the opportunity to suck every bit of knowledge out of them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 311 (location ~ 4760-4767)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>6. Be frugal and generous Most things we do for our people cost nothing. Have vendors bring services in-house or negotiate lunch delivery from a local sandwich shop. TGIF and guest speakers require only a room and a microphone. Yet they result in a Brownian abundance: Googlers are constantly bumping into a new service or intriguing discussion. Save your big checks for the times when your people are most in need, the moments of greatest tragedy and joy. Your generosity will have the most impact when someone needs emergency medical attention or when families are welcoming new members. Focusing on those most human moments underscores that your organization cares about each individual, personally. And everyone will draw comfort from knowing that should they encounter one of life’s lowest or highest moments, they’ll have the strength of a larger institution behind them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 312 (location ~ 4771-4778)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>7. Pay unfairly Remember that performance follows a power law distribution in most jobs, no matter what your HR department tells you. Ninety percent or more of the value on your teams comes from the top 10 percent. As a result, your best people are worth far more than your average people. They might be worth 50 percent more than your average people or fifty times more, but they are absolutely worth more. Make sure they feel it. Even if you don’t have the financial resources to provide huge differences in pay, providing greater differences will mean something.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 312 (location ~ 4784-4788)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>8. Nudge The single idea in this book with the most potential to tangibly improve the rest of your life is to change how much of each paycheck you save. If you compare people who have earned the same amount over thirty years, there can be a 3,000 percent difference in how much wealth they accumulate, and it is almost entirely determined by how much they save. And it is almost never easy to save. Unless you are richer than Croesus, every dollar of savings will feel like a trade-off. Do I buy the name brand or the generic? The $3 peanut butter cup or skip dessert? Trade in your car or hold on to it for one more year? In my first year after college, while working as an actor and a waiter, I used to frequent the Hostess Thrift Shop near my town, which sold bread and pastries that were just at the edge of expiration. I got my snack cakes (in moderation!), and was able to save a few extra dollars each week. Remember that getting Googlers to tweak their savings rates by less than 3 percent will add $262,000 to each Googler’s retirement fund.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 313 (location ~ 4791-4799)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>9. Manage the rising expectations You’ll trip up sometimes and need to take backward steps. Be prepared to eat your goji pie. Knowing that, tell people around you that you’ll be experimenting with ideas from this book before you start experimenting. That will help transform them from critics to supporters, and they’ll extend you more benefit of the doubt if things go awry.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 314 (location ~ 4810-4813)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>10. Enjoy! And then go back to No. 1 and start again Larry and Sergey set out to create the kind of place where they’d both want to work. You can do the same thing. Even if you join a company fresh out of school, as a junior employee, or as employee number 1,000,006, you can still be a founder by choosing how you interact with those around you, how you design your workspace, and how you lead. In doing so, you’ll help create a place that will attract the most talented people on the planet. This isn’t a one-time effort. Building a great culture and environment requires constant learning and renewal. Don’t worry about trying to do everything at once. Experiment with one idea from this book or with a dozen, learn from the experiment, tweak the program, and try again.</em></p>
