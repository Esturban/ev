<p><em>More than 1 million lawsuits are filed each year in this country. How many of those do you think are frivolous, but are nevertheless settled out of court? More than one reader has answered a knock on the door and went into shock at being greeted by reporters, photographers, and trucks with big satellite dishes outside of his or her home! From this day forward, when you read your newspaper or watch the news on TV, start searching for cases where an unknown person is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight, then ask yourself: COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAPPEN TO ME? The following are just a few of the many things that could bring the media, or worse, to your home: • A bomb goes off, you were in the area, and the FBI thinks you fit the profile. • An identity sketch of the person who robbed the convenience store at 11:45 p.m. last night is flashed on TV, and it looks just like you. And you don’t have a plausible excuse for that time that anyone’s going to believe. • You were innocently involved with the wrong people and the 60 Minutes crew is within minutes of tracking you down. • Someone faked your e-mail address when searching for sex with twelve-year-olds, and the police are at your door.</em></p>

<p><em>Before we continue, let me say that if someone with unlimited funds is after you, you will eventually be found. If you doubt this, contact a competent private investigator and say, “I wish to disappear so completely that even you couldn’t find me. Can you help me?” The six-word answer will be, “No, because I can find anyone!” And I agree. Repeatedly, private investigators (PIs) make this point in their books, articles, and personal interviews. And if the police are truly after you, their record isn’t bad, either. Captain Robert L. Snow, a police officer for more than twenty-five years, says in his book Protecting Your Life, Home, and Property that the Indianapolis Police Department finds 98 or 99 percent of all persons reported to them as missing. In the Private Investigator section of my home library, I find no PIs anywhere who will admit defeat under any circumstances, as long as payment is forthcoming. The closest I can come to a failure is a certain PI who says he successfully tracked down 298 of the 299 targets he was given over his lifetime. As for the one he missed, he eventually</em></p>

<p><em>A PI in Tennessee once outlined his standard method of searching for assets: The first thing I do when I search for hidden assets is pull the subject’s credit report. I look for credit cards, ATMs, etc., issued by banks. Some small banks like the ones you describe automatically issue these cards. You’d have to specifically tell them you don’t want them, otherwise they appear on your credit report and the bank is exposed. If he doesn’t find you with that method, or in the phone book, he’ll usually give up.</em></p>

<p><em>Francis Beaumont, one of England’s most popular playwrights in the Age of Shakespeare, had this to say about secrets: All confidence which is not absolute and entire is dangerous. There are few occasions but where a man ought either to say all, or conceal all, for, how little ever you have revealed of your secret to a friend, you have already said too much if you think it not safe to make him privy to all particulars. Allow me to rephrase his comment, boiled down to plain language of the present day: Do not reveal confidential information—and especially not your home address—to your attorney, CPA, banker, doctor, dentist, school authorities, relatives, family, friends, or anyone else unless you would trust them with your life.</em></p>

<p><em>INTERNATIONAL SLANT Most books on privacy—including the previous editions of this book—have been written specifically for Americans. The reason is that Americans are under more attacks for frivolous lawsuits, tracked by more PIs, targeted for more asset seizures by the Treasury Department, and jailed for more “Homeland Security” charges than any place else on the planet. Compare the United States to other nations (figures are approximate): United States 737 in jail, per 100,000 people South Africa 402 in jail, per 100,000 people Thailand 340 in jail, per 100,000 people Chile 204 in jail, per 100,000 people Israel 174 in jail, per 100,000 people Mexico 169 in jail, per 100,000 people New Zealand 160 in jail, per 100,000 people England, Wales 152 in jail, per 100,000 people Spain 144 in jail, per 100,000 people China 119 in jail, per 100,000 people Canada 116 in jail, per 100,000 people Australia 116 in jail, per 100,000 people Netherlands 112 in jail, per 100,000 people Germany 96 in jail, per 100,000 people Andorra 90 in jail, per 100,000 people Sweden 75 in jail, per 100,000 people Norway 64 in jail, per 100,000 people Iceland 40 in jail, per 100,000 people Nigeria 33 in jail, per 100,000 people Nevertheless, the entire world is now changing, and not for the better.

<p><em>Consider the case of George Joseph Cvek, as presented in the book Diary of a D.A. by Martin M. Frank, formerly an assistant district attorney in the Bronx. Frank writes: When the doorbell rang on that January afternoon, a young housewife opened her apartment door to find a slim, ordinary-looking man of about twenty-eight standing at the threshold. He was a stranger to her. “Are you Mrs. Allen?” he asked. “Yes, I am.” “Is your husband home?” “No,” she replied, “he isn’t here now.” “Gee, I’m sorry,” he said. “I know him from Norwalk, Connecticut. I thought this was his early day. Maybe I’ll come back tonight.” He seemed rather well acquainted with her husband, a route salesman in Connecticut for a bakery company. The caller half-turned to go, then stopped and apologetically asked, “Could I have a drink of water?” Sure,” she said, “wait here a second.” Leaving him at the door, Mrs. Allen went into the kitchen. When she returned, she found that he had walked through the foyer into the living room and was seated on the sofa.… The caller continued to deceive Mrs. Allen and then suddenly struck her down and</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>The caller continued to deceive Mrs. Allen and then suddenly struck her down and prepared to rape her. At that moment, the telephone rang. He jumped up and ran from the apartment, slamming the door behind him. But in the years to come, more than 200 women were not so fortunate. Their telephones did not ring. In each case, the caller gained entrance by telling the wife he knew her husband, and after gaining entrance through subterfuge, he raped and killed her, then burglarized the home. In each case it was the husbands themselves who had unwittingly made the crime possible. They had picked up a neatly dressed hitchhiker—George Joseph Cvek—who said he was from Boys Town, Nebraska, and given him a ride. When Cvek was dropped off, he asked the drivers for their home address so he could show his appreciation for the ride by mailing him a small gift. At that instant, each husband sealed his wife’s death warrant. Note: More than half the people who come to me for help are at the time receiving both mail and packages at their home address. In my opinion, this is an incredible error, a matter of life and death. An extreme viewpoint? Mike Ketcher of Burnsville, Minnesota, editor of The Financial Privacy Report, certainly doesn’t think so. He hired Yon Son Moon, a divorced woman, to work in his office. Yon Son’s ex-husband, Jae Choe, had been harassing her for years. When Mike hired Yon Son, Choe was furious. Eventually he went on a rampage, shooting Yon Son, their fourteen-year-old son John, and two policemen, after which he killed himself. The publisher of the newsletter, Daniel Rosenthal, sums up the two important lessons learned, as follows: First, if you think the police are there to protect you, let me tell you differently. Yon Son had a restraining order against Choe. So did we, at our home and our office. But the police ignored our repeated requests to enforce these restraining orders, despite Choe’s continual violations and threats. On several occasions they literally laughed at our requests for enforcement. Second, when the police don’t work, privacy DOES work. The only person in our company that was truly safe was Mike Ketcher. He was safe because he kept his personal affairs so private that Mr. Choe couldn’t find him. Hiding your home address is not easy, but it’s doable, one step at a time. The first step is to immediately stop sending and receiving mail at your home address.</em></p>

<p><em>When you walk out to the curb, place your mail in the box, and raise the red flag, your mail is as vulnerable to theft as your car would be if you left the key in it and the doors open. Every day more than 100,000 residential mailboxes in the United States are burglarized. This applies to mail being received both in the city and in the country, both in private homes and in apartment complexes. In Hammond, Indiana, before they were finally arrested, two men and a woman went from door to door but did not knock or ring any bells. The neighbors saw nothing more suspicious than each person depositing an advertising brochure in each mailbox. What they didn’t see was the sleight of hand when the person traded the brochure for whatever mail was in the box. More than a year prior to the rant about theft from a mailbox, the same Seattle newspaper had run a series of articles warning of mail theft not only from home mailboxes but from mail collection boxes on the street, plus the boxes used at thousands of apartments, condominiums, and commercial buildings in the Pacific Northwest. For months, thieves had been using counterfeit “arrow keys.” Each arrow key provides access to about 2,500 mail collection boxes, more than 10,000 apartments and condominiums, and virtually all office and commercial buildings in the region. (The keys give postal workers easy access to the mailboxes, making it easier for them to pick up and deliver messages and packages.)</em></p>

<p><em>TAKE THIS IMMEDIATE STEP TO PROTECT YOUR MAIL If you are presently receiving mail at home, turn in a forwarding address. But where should this mail go? Certainly not to any permanent address you will use in the future. The following are some options: 1. If you presently have a PO box, choose that address. 2. Have it sent on to your place of business if you have one, or perhaps to a friend who is in business. 3. Rent a box at a commercial mail-receiving agency (CMRA). 4. Obtain a ghost address (of which more will be said later) in some faraway state or country and have the mail sent there.</em></p>

<p><em>What is a “mail cover”? This is a system used by a number of governments to check your mail without a court order. Your mailman, or the clerk that “boxes” your mail will be instructed to note the return addresses and country of origin of your incoming mail. If you live a squeaky-clean life, you may say to yourself, imitating Mad magazine’s Alfred E. Neuman, “What? Me worry?” Read on: Suppose you send mail to a person or company that is the subject of a mail cover? If you list your name and return address, you yourself could end up on a suspect list. There are at least two obvious solutions: 1. Copy the British—eliminate a return address. 2. Use some other return address, far, far away. Recently, the postal authorities are getting more cautious, e.g., the current requirement of making you take any parcel weighing more than thirteen ounces to the counter, in person. For such parcels, they will insist you include a return address.</em></p>

<p><em>I send out large volumes of mail, so I use a postage meter. Any danger there? I don’t know how large a volume you refer to, but with one of my previous businesses, my wife and I used to mail 2,000 letters a week. We had a regular system, using self-adhesive stamps. First, we stuck one stamp on each of four fingers, then we put them on 4 envelopes, one, two, three, four, and repeat. Why didn’t we use a postage meter? Because each postage meter has an identification number that ties it to a renter and to a specific location, that’s why.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 372-376)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Does it matter if—unsure of the exact postage—I put on more than enough stamps? Judge for yourself. I know of a case in Missouri where a man put $38 postage on a small package that weighed less than two pounds. Destination, Los Angeles, but it didn’t arrive. In view of the excess postage, the DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) was called in, and the package turned out to contain $10,000 in cash. Although I do not know if the source of the money was legal, I do know that the DEA “arrests” and keeps most confiscated cash, even though the owner may never be convicted of anything. Actually, cash can be mailed most anywhere using many envelopes and small sums per envelope. With $38, the Missourian could have bought eighty-six first-class stamps. Had he then put just four $100 bills in each envelope, wrapping the money with a page or two from a magazine, he could have mailed out, not $10,000, but $34,400. And if mailed on different days from various post offices, and with a variety of fictitious return addresses, would anyone even have a clue? This was not the first time I heard of incorrect postage alerting the authorities. One of the telltale signs postal inspectors look for, in the case of letter bombs, is excess postage. I use an unusually accurate electronic scale and double-check all outgoing mail.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 377-387)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>How secure is my incoming mail? That depends on where it’s coming from, what it looks like, and who your enemies are. Under normal circumstances, I have far more confidence in regular mail (often referred to as snail mail) than in most electronic mail, because there is no possible way to scan the interiors of all letters in the U.S. postal system at any one time. Contrast this with electronic mail, which can be computer-searched at every junction along the way, red-flagging messages with any of hundreds or thousands of key words such as bomb, gas, gun, rifle, money, cash, or with any specific name including yours. Note, however, that certain government officials do monitor mail from tax-haven countries, especially those on the following list: Antigua Aruba Austria Bahamas Belize Bermuda British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Channel Islands Columbia Cook Islands Ecuador Estonia Gibraltar Germany Great Britain Guernsey Hong Kong Hungary Iran Isle of Man Latvia Liberia Liechtenstein Lithuania Luxembourg Marshall Islands Nauru Nevis Netherlands Nigeria Pakistan Panama Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Switzerland Thailand Turks and Caicos Islands United Arab Emirates Uruguay Vanuatu Venezuela</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Further, anyone with a spray can of freon gas—sold under various trade names in spy shops—can read what’s inside without opening the envelope at all. When hit with the spray, the envelope becomes transparent. Thirty seconds later, as the gas evaporates, it returns to its normal condition, with no evidence of this intrusion. (To find out if this is happening, have your sender mail you an innocuous letter, using a felt-tip pen for addressing the envelope. The ink will run when carbon tetrachloride is used—thus tipping you off that the mail was read.) Methods once confined to the CIA are now common knowledge, thanks to Amazon.com. They offer used copies of the CIA Flaps and Seals Manual that carefully details “surreptitious entries of highly protected items of mail,” and removing and replacing seals and using carbon tetrachloride on tape. What worries the CIA and other surreptitious readers of secret mail is not the sealed or taped envelope, but the normal one. “The most innocuous-looking envelope,” says the CIA manual, “may be the one that will get the operator in the most trouble.” Correct! See the following question and answer about innocuous-looking envelopes. How I can best protect my outgoing mail? First of all, the envelope should appear normal. A junk-mail appearance is best (as long as the recipient knows that in advance), and for that reason I prefer a standard #10 envelope with a laser-printed label. If a sealed, taped, or otherwise obviously protected envelope is desired, enclose and protect everything in a #9 envelope and insert that one in the #10 envelope. If you are not familiar with U.S. envelope numbers, note these measurements: #10 envelope: 41/8 × 91/2 in. (10.5 × 24 cm.) #9 envelope: 37/8 × 87/8 in. (10 × 22.5 cm.) To counteract the envelope’s transparency when sprayed with freon, wrap the contents of the #9 envelope with carbon paper, if you can still find it in this modern age.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>What’s the best way to have a letter remailed from some faraway place? For a few years after the anthrax scare that followed the events of 9/11, it was best not to even think about remailing a letter. However, the scare seems to have receded, so I’ll suggest a method that usually works quite well. Prepare your letter, seal it in an addressed #9 envelope (available at any office-supply store), and put on the correct postage. Enclose your letter in a #10 envelope, add a cover letter as shown below, and a $5 bill. Note that you don’t use a last name, so there is no way to prove you were not a guest. Sheraton El Conquistador Attention: Concierge I was a recent guest at your hotel, and most impressed with your fine service. I do, however, have a small problem, and I must ask you a favor. During my Arizona stay, I promised to write to a friend about an errand he gave me, and also to an associate while in Tucson. I forgot to do both things, so would you kindly help me cover my derrière by mailing the enclosed items? I enclose $5 for your trouble, and hope to thank you in person when I return to the Sheraton El Conquistador later this year. Yours sincerely, Jim Mail your letter to “Concierge” at one of the very best hotels in the city of your choice. (You can get the name and address from AAA, or off the Internet.) Here is a sample of how to address the envelope: For the CONCIERGE: Sheraton El Conquistador 10000 North Oracle Road Tucson, Arizona 85737 Note: If there is some doubt that the hotel has a concierge, just address the letter to “Reception.” (If there isn’t a reception desk, you’ve chosen too small a hotel.) From now on, when you travel, pick up sample envelopes and letterheads from luxury hotels. Staying at them is best, but you can often just drift up to the desk when they’re busy with check-ins and kindly ask for “a sheet of paper and an envelope.” One of each is enough, as you’ll never use a specific hotel for remailing more than once.</em></p>

<p><em>Conclusion: Normally, it makes no difference whether you put a return address on the front or the back of the envelope. However, mail handlers can make a note of the return addresses you are using, if they have a legitimate reason for doing so. If, therefore, you are concerned about certain sensitive mail, one suggestion would be to not include a return address on your outgoing mail. A better solution, however, would be to use a ghost address for the return. That way, you will know if your letter failed to arrive. (It may be returned for insufficient postage or for an error in the address. These things happen to the best of us.) It will also prevent your letter from ending up in Atlanta, Saint Paul, or San Francisco. These are the USPS’s three major mail recovery centers and once your letter gets there, it will be opened and examined.</em></p>

<p><em>Since lying is a moral issue, and since morality is basically a religious issue, I am going to cite the exact words from a small religious magazine I read back in 1954. It was published by the International Bible Students Association, and since it answered a question I had long wondered about, I memorized this sentence word for word: A LIE is a false statement made by one to another, who is entitled to hear and know the truth, and which false statement tends toward injury to the other. This is the only definition of a lie I’ve ever read that covers untrue statements made by the biblical characters Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, David, Jonathan, and Rahab. Did they disgrace themselves as liars by their caution? Not according to the above definition. You, dear reader, must make your own evaluation … and accept the responsibility. What I have to say here is about decisions I myself have made. Although they are presented merely as guidelines for your meditation, I recommend them. For example: 1. Where no harm will be done, and no sworn oath is involved, I often give incorrect information. So does my wife. 2. I never give incorrect information if I am to sign a sworn statement, whether or not before a notary. 3. I may withhold information from the police or from government representative but I won’t lie to them. 4. Under no condition whatsoever will I file a false tax return.</em></p>

<p><em>I also confess to withholding information in other ways. If I run a small business out of my home, I neglect to get a business license. If I move, I neglect to inform the postal authorities. If asked for information when obtaining an e-mail address, I fail to list my true name and home address. You, the reader, have three choices: 1. You can follow the pattern I have set. 2. You can tell no untruth under any circumstance. 3. You can lie about everything and sign anything, true or not.</em></p>

<p><em>If you do not already have a post-office box, you may wish to obtain one for your personal mail. Then, you could rent a private mailbox from a CMRA and use both your name and a made-up “company name” for business mail, magazine subscriptions, and deliveries from FedEx and UPS. Until such time as you move, of course, your present street address will be in dozens—or more likely, hundreds—of databases. However, from this moment on, you will never again give out your street address. Then, when you move, and follow the advice in the chapters to come, you will drop below the radar.

<p><em>If a choice is available, rent a box as far away from your home as is convenient for picking up mail once or twice a week. The ideal situation—often the case if you have a long commute to work—is to have the box in another town. This is sometimes possible for those who live in “twin” cities. (If you live in East Minneapolis, get a box in West St. Paul.) ADVANTAGES First and foremost, you avoid having to give out your street address. In addition: • If you move to another location in the same area, there will be no changes to make for incoming mail. • Your mail will be safe from thieves, no matter how long you leave it in the box. • When you are on vacation, mail will not pile up at the mailbox at your home—a clear signal that the occupants are away. DISADVANTAGES The biggest single disadvantage of getting a post-office box is the process you have to go through. Prior to the passage of the U.S. Patriot Act (officially “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001”), it was fairly easy to rent a PO box and retain your privacy. This is no longer the case. Thus: • You must show two forms of ID, and one of them must show your current home address. (This violates the rule of never allowing your true name to be coupled with your true home address.) • If you list other persons who will also be receiving mail at this address, they, too, must now furnish two forms of identification. • If in the United States, you must sign PS Form 1093 right next to this chilling statement: Signature of Applicant: I certify that all information furnished on this form is accurate, truthful, and complete. I understand that anyone who furnishes false or misleading information on this form or omits information requested on this form may be subject to criminal and/or civil penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Fortunately, I know of no holder who has ever been jailed for fudging on the application, as long as the box was never used for any fraudulent purpose. Hopefully, after filling out the form truthfully, you will then soon move. I am not a lawyer but as I understand it, failing to inform the post office of a move is not a criminal offense. If they ever find out—which is unlikely—they will almost certainly just close your box.</em></p>

<p><em>Might you have a friend or relative with the same last name? If he or she is agreeable, you could receive mail in their box. Most postal employees have more important duties than to check the first names of everyone in a family. Another suggestion is to open the box in the name of a limited liability company. Example: Your name is Abraham Goldstein but you wish to establish a new identity under the name of Robert Johnson. Form an LLC named “Robert Johnson LLC.” Then rent a box in your own name (check the box for Residential/Personal Use). There will be a space for other names (currently on the back of PS Form 1093 July 2011), and this is where you list the LLC. Send yourself a few letters from time to time, addressed to “Robert Johnson LLC.” After that, there may be no problem in receiving mail in your new name, even though the ending “LLC” is not included. Or, for total anonymity along with a new name, find someone whose mailbox you can take over. Either they are moving away or are poor enough so that a cash contribution will allow you to take over their box. (Naturally, you will send their mail on to whatever address they later give you.) Use this person’s basic name—with a slight alteration—as if it were your own. For instance, if the box holder’s name is José L. Hernandez, just change the first name to Joe, or the middle initial to R. Or, if you are determined to use a different name—say, Veronica Victoria, slowly work your way through the series below, sending letters to this box number and addressed to: 1. Veronica Victoria, c/o José Hernandez 2. V. Victoria &amp; J. Hernandez 3. Victoria &amp; Hernandez 4. V. Victoria My experience has been that—in many cases—after six months, mail in whatever name will be delivered to the box. When time comes for paying the annual fee, do not of course show up at the counter. Mail in a money order with the name “José L. Hernandez” as the sender. Here’s one more idea: Third-class mail from the previous box holder may still be coming to the box you’ve just rented. Hmm … might that be as good a name as any for your alternate identity? (If you do, however, make sure you never apply for credit in that name, nor use it for any other fraudulent activity. Also, you might check him out on the Internet, to make sure he isn’t on something like a sex-offender list!)</em></p>

<p><em>Can I rent a PO box with a single visit? Post office employees are not consistent. Some of my readers report getting a box on the first visit by showing ID with their home address. Others, however, have had an experience such as this: “I went to the post office to rent a box. They told me I had to fill out the form and they would then verify the information. After that, they said they would mail me a letter. I would then have to take that letter back to the post office and only then could I obtain a box.” Can I open a PO box without showing my driver’s license (which is from another state)? Normally, yes. Use your passport and, if asked for a second piece of ID, use a current lease, a mortgage, a voter or vehicle registration card, or a home or vehicle insurance policy. One senior citizen writes: The clerk used my credit card (she did not know it was canceled) as the second ID. She wrote down my credit card number on the application. Another clerk told her that it was illegal to write the number down. She scribbled it out and said she had gotten yelled at last week by her boss for not writing down the second ID. She then commented that she had never used anything but a license before. Note: Form 1583A specifically excludes credit cards as identifications.</em></p>

Discuss whatever services they offer, and then, as you’re leaving, imitate the late Peter Falk in the old Columbo shows: “Oh, by the way, do you happen to accept mail here for any of your clients?” If they do not, move on. If, however, they say, “Well, only for three or four…” see if they will take you on. If they agree, you can almost certainly be added to their list without showing ID. These small services sort mail by name alone, without a box number added.

<p><em>SHOULD YOU ALLOW ANYONE AT YOUR GHOST ADDRESS TO KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE? Only you can answer that question. Hopefully, when you made the arrangements, you gave an address other than your own, and no telephone number. However, have they gotten to know you? Do they recognize your car? If so, might they have seen it in front of your home? What follows is a chilling example of what unfortunately goes on all too often, not only at commercial mail drops, but even at some of the ghost addresses. Sally Overstreet (not her actual name) is a newspaper reporter who has twice moved to avoid an ex-lover who has been stalking her for years. Unknown to Sally, her stalker is now working with a Level Three private investigator. The PI shows up at her new address. He is wearing a UPS uniform and carries a box addressed to Sally Overstreet. The return address is that of a major New York publisher. The supposed UPS man says he must pick up a certified check for $200 before leaving the box. The next day is a Saturday—or a holiday—and the UPS man insists the box is something Ms. Overstreet has to have today. Could the folks at the new address kindly tell him where Ms. Overstreet can be reached? How about a telephone number? Where does she work, maybe the box can be delivered there? This ruse often works, which is why it remains so popular. The PI’s uniform need not appear to be from the UPS. Perhaps it is from FedEx, Brink’s Security, or Flowers “R” Us. The return address and the story that comes with it can be anything. The object is the same, to find anyone at your mailing address that knows how to locate you. There are two ways to protect yourself from this deception. One is to make sure that no one at your new address knows anything about you. The other is to use persons who, although they know you, will positively protect you. If the latter, then make sure to educate them about the various scams that may be used in an attempt to deceive them.</em></p>

<p><em>YOUR HOUSE NUMBER There may be some local laws about displaying house numbers but if so, I have never known it to be enforced. The reason we do not display a number on our house, much less give anyone the number, is that eventually someone will write it down. Then they may use the address to send a thank-you note and the mailperson will discover (1) who lives at this address, and (2) that there is no mailbox. A friend of ours did let both the mailbox and the number remain on a house he purchased. He neglected to warn a visiting aunt that he never received mail at home. At Christmastime, she sent him a gift subscription to Robb Report in his real name, of course, and with his true street address! If you delete the number on your house but still need to have others find it, here’s a little trick. If guests are coming, tell them that once they pass a certain landmark or cross street, “Watch for a house on the right with a pink flamingo on the lawn.” (Don’t forget to go out and plant the bird before they arrive. Extract it after they leave. They may never find the place again.)</em></p>

<p><em>We do use our home address on our tax returns, but isn’t that information confidential? Louis Mitzel Jr., a former special agent and intelligence officer with the U.S. Department of State and a prolific author, tells the story of Lee Willis, a lowly clerk with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Willis had been stalking his ex-girlfriend for sixteen months. She thought she was safe because her home address was kept secret, her telephone number was kept secret, and she made sure her friends and neighbors kept a lookout for the stalker. Although 56,000 IRS employees have access to taxpayer files, Willis was not one of them. He did, however, persuade a coworker to illegally run a search for him. The ex-girlfriend was filing her tax returns under her true address. Willis raced to her apartment building. The lobby was locked, but he pressed all the buzzers and one of the neighbors let him in. At the last moment, the girl discovered he was in the building, called the police, and they arrested him. When they then searched Willis’s car, they found a stun gun, rope, latex gloves, duct tape, and a knife. Does that answer your question? Let’s say each of the 56,000 IRS employees with access to the records has 5 close friends, and each of these friends has 5 close friends of his own. Are you willing to bet your life that not one of these 1.4 million persons would ever commit an illegal act, or coerce another into doing so?</em></p>

<p><em>How can I avoid giving out my daughter’s Social Security number, as well as our street address, when she starts school next year? Privacy in a public school system is nonexistent—simply unachievable. To maintain privacy, you do have two options: 1. A private school. 2. Home schooling (check out <a href="http://www.k12.com">www.k12.com</a>). In our own case, we raised our three children in Spain, at a time when—thanks to Generalissimo Francisco Franco—drugs were simply not available and sex among teenagers was unknown. We put the kids in a private school (German, with professors from Berlin), and when classes let out, my wife spent the next two hours with them teaching English. Although we took each child out of school at age fifteen, each in turn was better educated than the majority of today’s high school graduates, and could speak, read, and write in three languages. Friendly tip: Raise your children to be self-employed when they leave home, so that their names will never, ever, go into the National Directory for New Hires. And just think of all the money you’ll save by not sending them to college! (Like Mark Zuckerberg, I am a university dropout. I don’t know about Zuckerberg, but I myself have never regretted dropping out during my senior year, back in the 1940s. Not for a day, an hour, or a minute.) Says columnist Arnold Ahlert from Jewish World Review, October 13, 2011 (italics added): Maybe the smartest thing the protesters, and perhaps of lot of other Americans, could do would be to pressure businesses to stop making a college degree the ultimate criterion for getting a job. If one considers where the so-called “best and brightest” among us have taken this country in the last few years, one could make a compelling argument that a college degree is the most over-rated product on the planet.</em></p>

<p><em>OBTAINING CONSENT TO ENTER BY DECEPTION The following is based on information from the January 1994 F.B.I. Law Enforcement Bulletin, now in the public domain. The below applies to any home that federal agents would like to search, but for lack of evidence are unable to obtain a warrant. A van that appears to be from a well-known courier service pulls into your driveway and the driver, with a package in hand, rings your bell. He asks for a certain person and when you say no such person lives at this address, he asks to use your telephone to supposedly “call the company.” If you allow him to do it, and if—while in your home—he observes anything that might be illegal, he may return within a few hours. This time he’ll be with police officers who have a warrant to search your home, based on what the “deliveryman” observed earlier. You and I are law-abiding persons, with nothing to hide. Nevertheless, why invite strangers into your home? Just say no, and give the location of the nearest pay phone. Or, if you need an excuse, here are two: • “My husband,” says the wife, “told me never to allow strangers into the house when he’s not here.” • “All we have is a cell phone and I lent it to my father today.” Sometimes, of course, no warrant is needed, as the following section explains.</em></p>

If you feel that it is imperative to have a delivery made to where you really live, it must not be in your name. All courier companies keep a national database of names and addresses and countless thousands of their employees can run a search of your name. PIs know this and many have contacts inside these companies. If, in fact, you have ever received a letter or package at your present address under your real name, the only way to protect your privacy is to move. Once this move has been made, then any future delivery must be in another name. When you sign for the delivery, sign your other name. You may get by with no problems doing this, as long as you do not order expensive items from out of state. If you do, however, keep in mind that in states with a sales tax, it is not uncommon for irate neighbors to call the tax department and report that the people next door are buying such-and-such to avoid the state’s sales tax.

The logical solution to anonymity with courier services would be to have your parcels come into one of their nearby offices and just pick them up there. Unfortunately, these companies do not employ logic. Whereas they never ask for ID at a private home, they absolutely demand it if you stop by one of their offices to pick anything up. I have argued this point in vain with the various home offices, pointing out that if I send a package in a certain name, I will sign a waiver to the effect that they may deliver to any person asking for it in that name. After all, this is similar to item number 8 on all FedEx labels, which reads: “Release Signature. Sign to authorize delivery without obtaining signature.” In fact, if you really wish to remain incognito, have the sender sign on the line for this release and when you see the FedEx truck arrive, do not answer the door.</em></p>

Call the police department or even 911 on your cell phone, to check them out.

<p><em>What about the cleaning lady or the carpet cleaner? At the very least, use someone that your friends have used for years and will recommend without reservations. However, if you have deep secrets to protect, this precaution may not be enough. PIs have been known to offer serious money to obtain trash from a home office before papers have been shredded. My next suggestion may be worth far more to you than the price you paid for this book. Employ only longtime members of Jehovah’s Witnesses. Unlike the mainstream religions, virtually no Witnesses are in jail anywhere unless (as in many countries)—they are there for their faith. These people would rather die than cheat, use drugs, steal, or accept a bribe to sell their employer out. For this reason, Witnesses do up to 80 percent of the nightly janitorial work in office buildings in major American cities, and are much in demand for nighttime janitorial work in clinics (due to drugs being present). They also do the cleaning in many upscale homes and mansions where security is paramount. The Witnesses often have no objections to working late at night or very early in the morning, because this gives them time for their ministry during the day. Another plus is that they’ll work on December 25, January 1, July 4, or any other national holiday. Although they call their meeting places “Kingdom Halls,” you can find them in the Yellow Pages under “Churches.” Over the years we’ve learned that the best time to call a Kingdom Hall is at 6:45 p.m. on a Tuesday, or 9:45 a.m. on a Sunday. (This is fifteen minutes before a meeting is about to start.) Ask to speak to one of the “elders.” If they are busy, leave your number and have them call back. When an elder comes on the line, do not call him an “elder,” and don’t use a title such as pastor or reverend—they do not use titles. Just explain what you need and add that you prefer a worker who is a “pioneer.” This is the term Witnesses use for those who put a certain minimum number of hours in their Bible-teaching work. They cannot be pioneers unless they have an excellent reputation both within and without their congregation.</em></p>

<p><em>One of my PI friends reports getting the following information about a couple with two teens. It took him less than a week. None of the information came from an informant or from the Internet. • The name of their doctor and the information that the father was buying Viagra. • Someone in the family was consuming a lot of cheap whiskey. • The son was working for minimum wage at a hamburger joint. • The family was behind on their phone bills, due to lengthy calls to Spain. So where did the information come from? From their trash. Once set on the curb, it’s fair game for anyone! And such items as empty pill bottles, paycheck stubs, bank statements, telephone bills, magazines, and want ads that are circled in a newspaper can reveal amazing amounts of information.</em></p>

<p><em>The intrepid PI takes the job, despite the following drawbacks: • If Victor is with friends, there is no way to track him down via rental agreement, telephone, or utilities. • There are more than 10,000 Latinos in the Lake Tahoe area and nearly 80 percent of them come from the same place: Ameca, Jalisco (Mexico). • A quick check shows that there is no landline telephone at Fernando’s apartment. Our resolute PI is on the job that very evening, prepared for action. What he wants is every bit of trash that leaves Fernando’s apartment for the next thirty days. He observes that there are two large Dumpsters near the entrance of the parking lot, and learns that they are dumped between 3 and 4 a.m. every day. There is no uniformity in the bags the residents are using. Some are paper, some are white plastic bags from the supermarkets, and some are large black trash bags. The PI knows of a Guatemalan family where three teenagers are desperate for work, any kind of work, even diving into Dumpsters. If you wish to play detective, see if you can answer this question: How will his Guatemalan friends know which garbage belongs to Fernando? Okay, check your answer with what happened next. Late one evening, the PI goes from door to door, calling at each of the sixteen apartments that were on Fernando’s floor. He wears a uniform with a name tag and presents each renter with a free supply of thirty trash bags, speaking Spanish or English as the occasion warrants. “This is part of an experiment by our company,” he says with a disarming smile. “The idea is to see if these extra-strong bags will cause less spillage when our trucks unload at the processing plant. If you and your neighbors use these bags for the next thirty days, we may continue to furnish them at no charge.” A young, pregnant woman answers the door at Fernando’s apartment. He gives her the pitch and hands her the bags. “Muchas gracias,” she says. Then the three Guatemalans got their assignment. They are to take turns drifting past the Dumpsters both morning and evening, checking to see if there is a bag from Fernando’s apartment. For every bag they bring in, the PI pays them $20 cash. If he finds what he is looking for, there will be a $100 bonus. In the next two weeks, they bring in eight bags, and two days later they bring in the bag that pays a $100 bonus—Fernando has a smartphone and he’s tossed the statement in the trash after tearing it into tiny pieces. Pieced together with tape, the statement shows six long-distance calls to the same number at Zephyr Cove on the Nevada side of Lake Tahoe. That’s all it takes to track down Victor, at a cost of $280 to the kids and $96 for the bags. Have you have already guessed how the kids knew which bags to pick up? At fifteen doors, the PI gave away dark green bags. At Fernando’s door, he handed over dark blue bags. To paraphrase the late Johnnie Cochran: If it can be read, Then you must shred.</em></p>

<p><em>WHAT YOUR TRASH REVEALS ABOUT YOU Trash is not the remains of food. That is garbage. Trash is everything else. Unfortunately, the two may be mixed unless it is coming from an office building. Trash is to a detective what a gold nugget is to a prospector. Just imagine what investigators would have learned about you and your family if they had secretly gone through your trash for the last ninety days. We shall assume they started with a blank sheet, having no idea as to the occupants of your home. To put a picture together, they would have watched for any of the items in the following list. If there were any items that you had merely torn up (rather than using a shredder), they would have put the pieces back together. • Bank statements with your name, address, account number, and balance. • Telephone bills revealing your number. • Utility and other bills, showing the name and address you use for those. • Credit card statements and receipts, invoices, ATM receipts. • Paycheck and/or money order stubs. • Empty bottles from prescription medicine, with your doctor’s name. • Personal and business letters; all address labels. • Scraps of paper revealing a phone number or e-mail address. • Beer cans, wine, and liquor bottles. • Anything to indicate drug use, including triangular scraps of paper. • Itemized grocery and pharmacy slips, for evidence of alcohol, illness, condoms, birth control pills, or anything to indicate homosexual activity. • Classified ads from newspapers, to see if anything is circled. • Magazines, travel brochures, or anything that would indicate interest in weapons or strange practices. What else can you think of, in your particular case? Or that of your friends, relatives, or even your children? Do you have a weekly arrangement for a woman to come in and clean? Does she have access to the trash? If you work in an office, who handles the trash? Did you know that janitors are sometimes bribed to turn trash from a specific office over to private investigators or government agents? Mostly likely, if you do everything else right, no one will be able to sift through your trash because they cannot find you in the first place.</em></p>

Do not furnish her Social Security number or date of birth. A quick-and-dirty method of setting up the utility accounts on short notice is to use a nominee (proxy), someone who will act on your behalf (see chapter 13.) Usually, the utility company will demand a cash deposit in lieu of being able to check your credit by using your Social Security number. Fine, give them a money order or a bank check for the deposit. It will be returned to you after one year of timely payments. Make sure that the bills never come to your home address. Give them your “ghost” address (see chapter 5), explaining that (a) you do not have a mailbox at the street address, and (b) all bills are paid from your “business” (ghost) address. What has been accomplished? Just this: If a private investigator—acting on behalf of a stalker or working with a law firm or insurance company—starts searching for you, one of the first places he will check (after cable TV) will be the utility companies. If your name is in any database, the PI will obtain the address. But as long as your name never shows up, the search will be in vain.</em></p>

<p><em>We have a small business that deals with top-secret information. How can we make sure that trash taken from our office building at night does not, under any circumstances whatsoever, fall into the hands of a private investigator from one of our competitors? First on the list is to cross-shred everything. Then, give the job to the class of janitors recommended previously. Here is an additional suggestion, in case you do not want anyone to even read what may be lying open on a desk. In larger cities, there are congregations of Jehovah’s Witnesses who speak other languages besides English, such as Spanish, Russian, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, French, Hindi, Japanese, Albanian, Polish, Portuguese, Greek, Punjabi, Hmong, and—in California—Quechua. Communication may be a problem, but if the workers speak a little if any English, that may be a plus. If fact, if a PI tries to bribe a worker who speaks only Albanian or Chinese Mandarin, best of luck!</em></p>

<p><em>YOUR DATE OF BIRTH (DOB) No matter how common your name, you can be quickly identified in a database by coupling either your name or your birth date with your address. Keeping your true home address a secret has already been discussed. As for a birth date, I seldom give out any date whatsoever. For instance, I once stopped in at a shopping mall to have my eyes tested. The doctor’s assistant handed me a long form to fill out, asking, among other things, my address, telephone number, Social Security number, and date of birth. I explained that I did not live in the area, did not give out my Social Security number, and my age was “more or less old.” No objection was raised. During the exam, the doctor asked me what I did for a living. “I’m a writer.” “Oh? What do you write?” “Articles and books about keeping your private life private. Which is why I didn’t give you a Social Security number nor a date of birth.” “Oh, well,” replied the doctor, “except for insurance cases, I don’t need that stuff on the form anyway!” (But they don’t tell you that when they hand you the form, right?) My next stop was nearby, at one of those national chains that have optical shops in malls. I picked out the two frames I wanted and the young sales clerk started to fill in the form. “Address?” she asked. “No local address, I live in Spain.” After a puzzled look, she wrote down the address of the store itself.</em></p>

Then she left it blank. The next question on the form was for a Social Security number but at this point the girl just shrugged and didn’t even ask me. Personally, I enjoy these challenges, but some of my clients do not. In fact, they hate confrontations of any kind. Often, if filling in a form yourself, you can just write “legal age.” Another alternative is to give a fictitious month and day, and a year a bit before or after the real one. If you feel obligated to give a date of birth, choose one that is easy to remember, such as a national holiday. Why not make yourself a few years younger at the same time?</em></p>

<p><em>YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER (SSN) The Privacy Act of 1974 (Pub. L. 93–579, I section 7) requires that any federal, state, or local government agency that requests your Social Security number (SSN) must tell you four things: 1. Whether disclosure of your SSN is required or optional. 2. What statute or other authority requires this number. 3. How they will use your SSN, once they have it. 4. What will happen if you do not provide them with your SSN. So if you are asked for your SSN by any federal, state, or local government agency (including any state university that accepts federal funds), look for the Privacy Act Statement. If it isn’t there, ask to see it before you give your number. Since the subject of this book is privacy, not tax evasion, I see no problem in furnishing your SSN to the Internal Revenue Service.</em></p>

<p><em>YOUR EMPLOYER’S DEMAND FOR YOUR DL, DOB, AND SSN The ideal employer is you yourself. I have been self-employed since 1958, and I recommend that course to one and all. But if this is not possible for you, then here comes some bad news. When you work for wages, the IRS requires the employer to get your Social Security number. Often they will ask for it before you’re hired, so they can check your credit and criminal (if any) record. Tell them you’ll give them your SSN if and when actually hired for the job. If this is not acceptable, ask yourself, “How badly do I want this job?” If you do take the job, know that your name, address, and Social Security number must by law go into the database for the National Directory of New Hires within twenty calendar days. This applies to virtually every person who is hired in the United States. The only wiggle room here is with the address. Do all within your power to give your employer only your ghost address. (If you don’t yet have one, perhaps you can use the address of a relative who lives in the same area.) In some cases, you may be able to work as an independent contractor and thus avoid giving out your Social Security number. An independent contractor is someone who works for another person or firm as a separate entity. The details are too complex to go into here, but if you think you might qualify, consult a CPA.</em></p>

<p><em>Remember, when a private investigator has an associate search for your records in the Medical Information Bureau, many identical names may come up. His first choice for picking you out will be your date of birth, and his second choice will be whatever address he may have for you (if any). The very last thing you want on your record is a consultation that indicates a nervous disorder, a psychiatric problem, or a sexually transmitted disease. For these consultations, pay cash and use a false name. Better yet, pop over into Canada or Mexico. If you can afford it, skip Medicare altogether and just pay all bills in cash. No personal information needed for that.</em></p>

<p><em>BANKS If you must have a U.S. bank account, open it in a business name or in the name of another person. When cashing checks, do not use your driver’s license for identification. Rather, use your passport because: • It does not show your Social Security number. • It does not show any address for you, not even the state or country in which you live. • Unlike the Department of Motor Vehicles (or whatever name it has in your state), you cannot easily be traced with your passport number. Occasionally, after presenting my passport, I have been asked for my driver’s license. I reply that I do not use my driver’s license for ID. In one small town, the bank teller confessed that she had never seen a passport before! I had to point out where the number was, so she could write it on the third-party check I was cashing.</em></p>

<p><em>In your present circumstances, you may find it impossible to get around these demands. If such is the case, my advice is to give in on most of the points but not on the Social Security number. (Once the SSN is used to check your credit, you can be targeted in a heartbeat.) Dress well, be polite, use your passport for ID, and offer to pay several months in advance. Above all, prepare beforehand to explain the reason—perhaps fear of a stalker—why you are simply unable to allow anyone to have your Social Security number. If you must furnish a copy of your tax return, black out your Social Security number, and then (to make sure it cannot still be read in front of a strong light) make a copy of that copy. Warning: If you succeed in renting an apartment without revealing your Social Security number, then never pay the rent with a personal check. Otherwise, a PI can trace it back to your bank and your bank does have your Social Security number. Instead, pay either in cash or with a money order purchased at a post office, a supermarket, or a convenience store.</em></p>

<p><em>John moved to a new area where he was having a home custom-built. Due to a myriad of delays and problems, the builders were six months away from completion. He checked the classifieds and found this one: For lease: 3,000 sq. ft. home on golf course. $1700/month plus $2000 deposit. Credit check mandatory. Call Amy at 783-99xx. The “credit check mandatory” did not scare John. As “Martin” Tallman he called Amy for an appointment, showed up in a conservative suit and tie, introduced himself as an investor who was considering a move to the area, and asked to see the property. The house had been on the market for nearly a year. After six months, the asking price of $495,000 had been reduced to $449,000, but, due to a current recession, the home had still not sold. Amy’s boss, who had built the home on speculation, had decided to lease it out until the market improved. Although the owner had hoped to lease it out for a minimum of one year, it was agreed that John could lease for just six months, with an option to extend the lease to one year. “You mentioned a credit report in your ad,” he said. “I prefer to keep my private affairs private, and for that reason I never give out my Social Security number. Since I always—” “Sir, we need your Social Security number for a credit report.” “As I started to say, since I always pay cash, a file has never been opened for me in any credit agency.” “Nevertheless,” said Amy, “we can make a routine check. If nothing turns up—” “Excuse me,” said John with a smile, holding up his hand. “If you send in a request, they will open a file for me, and there goes my privacy. Now then, I totally understand that you do not plan to lease this home unless you are sure that the monthly payments will come in, right?” “Of course, and that’s why—” “In my case, no monthly payments will be involved. I’ll pay cash in advance.” “For all six months?” “Yes, for all six months, and if I extend the lease at the end of that time, I will again pay for six months. I can give you the name of my attorney in San Francisco who will confirm that I am a law-abiding citizen. Here is my passport (showing it), and I will leave you a photocopy. We have no children, we throw no parties, my wife’s only hobby in life is scrubbing and cleaning, we have no pets, and neither of us smoke. You can leave the utilities in the present name and I’ll leave a deposit with you to cover them. I can have a bank cashier’s check for you within the hour. How shall I have it made out?” “I’ll have to talk to my boss.” “Fine, I’d like that. Is he here?” “No, I’ll have to call him. Could you come back at this same time tomorrow?” The lease went through the next day. Note: • No one was called for a reference. • No Social Security number was given. • The lease was in John’s middle and last name only, and did not include the name of his wife. • He listed no previous addresses. • Not one of the utilities was put into his name. • He never received any mail or deliveries at that address. • He avoided giving his date of birth.</em></p>

<p><em>OBTAINING CREDIT In many cases it may be extremely difficult to obtain credit without revealing your Social Security number, so you’ll have to ask yourself a question: “How desperately do I need this credit?” The correct answer should be, “Not that desperately!” In the Computer Privacy Handbook, author André Bacard quotes his grandfather’s opinion of credit: I’m 80 years old and free because I never owed a dime. Young people are addicted to credit. Mark my words, André. Credit will lead to a police state in America. I hope I die before then. My Scottish father and my Norwegian mother ran their lives the same way, quoting Proverbs 22:7 to my sister and me: “The borrower is a servant to the man doing the lending.” The advice was sound. I pass it on to you.</em></p>

<p><em>Can I get by without a passport, and still maintain my privacy? Yes of course … if you never travel by air, never pay in a store by check, never cash a check at a bank, never receive a registered letter, and are never otherwise called upon to prove your age or identity. Since this may not be practical for you, let’s discuss another aspect of drivers’ licenses. A recent news program on national television discussed the sale of pictures that go with state drivers’ licenses. The buyer is a company called Image Data. What had previously been kept secret was now made public (i.e., that the source of Image Data’s financing came from the U.S. Secret Service). Image Data says the only use for these pictures will be for businesses that accept checks. They will scan your driver’s license and check the picture on the screen to be sure it is really you. Two questions arise: 1. What use does the U.S. Secret Service have in mind for these pictures? 2. Why was Image Data attempting to hide the U.S. Secret Service connection? I cannot answer these questions. What I can do, however, is to continue to urge you not to use your driver’s license for anything other than showing it to a policeman if you are stopped for a violation. (And do all within your power never to be stopped!) Remember, for the past thirty-five years, most states have been selling the data from driver’s licenses. This includes your height, weight, and home address, none of which shows up on a passport. Also, if an investigator wishes to check you out, one of the places he will check is at the DMV in the state in which you live. I therefore say—once again—that one of the very best ways to maintain your privacy is to obtain a passport and use it alone for identification. (On the rare occasion when a second piece of ID is required, use something other than your driver’s license.)</em></p>

<p><em>Can’t I just apply for a new Social Security number? Many books have been published with advice about how to illegally obtain a new Social Security number. Some authors recommend you tell some wild story about how you were living in the jungles of New Guinea and just got back. More often, it is suggested you comb old newspapers for children who died young, and obtain—or fake—their birth certificate. These books are out of date because the Social Security Administration now requires anyone eighteen or older to show up in person with original or certified documents to prove age, identity, and U.S. citizenship, along with positive proof that no card has ever been issued previously. There are just three exceptions. These are for: 1. Those relocated with new identities under the Federal Witness Security Program. 2. Individuals who can prove they were victims of “identity theft” when criminals used their number repeatedly to get credit cards, make loans, and engage in other financial transactions. 3. Abused women who are hiding from husbands, ex-husbands, or former lovers. Until the latter part of 1999, only about 150 new numbers were granted each year. Since then, however, the Social Security Administration has been granting new numbers much more freely. In addition to original documents establishing your age, identity, and U.S. citizenship or lawful alien status, you will be asked for both your old and new names if you have changed your name. You must also present evidence showing you have custody of children for whom you are requesting new numbers; and evidence you may have documenting the harassment or abuse. The best evidence of abuse will come from third parties such as police, medical facilities, or doctors. Other evidence may include court restraining orders; letters from shelters, family members, friends; counselors or others who have knowledge of the domestic violence or abuse. (For additional information about new numbers for abused women, go to the agency’s Web site, <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10093.html.">www.ssa.gov/pubs/10093.html.</a>)</em></p>

<p><em>Can I avoid giving my Social Security number on the basis of Revelation, Chapter 13? I assume you are referring to the belief, held sincerely by some, that a Social Security number is the “mark of the beast.” It is true that in the past, several persons have won court cases objecting on religious grounds to state requirements for a SSN as a condition to receiving a driver’s license. In Leahy v. District of Columbia, the circuit court upheld John C. Leahy’s religious objection to providing his Social Security number in order to get a driver’s license. Later, five plaintiffs sued the city of Los Angeles on religious objection grounds, objecting to the state’s requirement that driver’s license applicants must provide a Social Security number as a condition to getting a license. They won the case in the State Superior Court, but I believe the state appealed that decision. If you really, truly believe that the use of a Social Security number violates your religious beliefs, then take your stand. If you go to jail—and some have—you will be suffering for what you feel is a righteous cause. But if you are thinking of challenging the authorities and just using religion as an excuse, then I urge you to back off. Join the rest of us who do furnish the number when absolutely necessary … but never otherwise.</em></p>

<p><em>You cited an example of a friend who paid his rent six months in advance in order to avoid giving out his SSN. But what if we can barely scrape together a deposit and one month in advance? If you are that broke, set the privacy issues aside for the moment. Get right to work on setting up an emergency fund—$5,000 minimum. (If you are making monthly payments on nonessentials like furniture, TV, or a fancy car, sell them.) Until you reach your goal, pay for nothing other than rent, gasoline, minimal repairs on an old car, utilities, insurance, and groceries. No cable TV, no movies, no newspapers, no soft drinks, no eating out, no alcohol, no cigarettes, and no new clothes or shoes. Don’t tell me it cannot be done. I know Mexicans with minimum-wage jobs who send money to their parents back in Mexico every month. Once you have your emergency fund in place, you can then—when necessary—pay your rent for six months in advance. This is the same as money in the bank.</em></p>

<p><em>Anyone can sign your name. If your attorney, CPA, or anyone else warns you that you cannot legally sign another person’s name, ask them to prove it. The only caveats are that the person whose name you are about to sign would confirm that you are authorized to do so, and that this action is not remotely associated with fraud. Example: You have the tax return for your Wyoming corporation, Oliver’s Oddities, Inc., ready to mail on the due date. However, you forgot that your cousin Oliver, who is substituting for you as the sole director, will have to sign. And Oliver is currently on an Arctic fishing trip. As long as you are absolutely convinced that Oliver would have signed, if he were present, then go ahead and sign his name. All the IRS wants to see is a signature. My only suggestion here is that, when Oliver returns, have him sign an acknowledgment affirming for the private corporate records that permission was given to sign his name.

In the morning’s mail comes his Social Security check. Can you sign his name and deposit his check in your joint account? Yes, because you know that, if any question comes up later, he will acknowledge your signature as his own. Naturally, you sign the check before you go to the bank. (Note: Many husbands and wives practice signing each other’s signatures for just such purposes as this, and some are skilled enough to fool any banker in the land.)

<p><em>YOU CAN USE ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SIGNATURES, INCLUDING ILLEGIBLE ONES In fact, among European businessmen, illegible is the order of the day. I used to work with a banker in Santa Cruz de Tenerife. His name was Hector Adelfonso de la Torre Romero y Ortega. This was his signature: “But why,” I’m often asked, “would anyone want an illegible signature?” Well, for signing letters to your friends, you do not want one, but why not have an alternative, illegible signature you can reproduce at will? Here are two reasons why such signatures are used so widely in Europe: • If a copy of a secret letter comes to light, the identity of the signer will not be evident. • Bank accounts can be in the name of another person or in the name of a legal entity, and the one receiving such a check will have no clue as to the signer. (Note: There should be no problem, in any event, with the bank itself. Only a few of the smallest banks actually check signatures.)</em></p>

Try one of the following: • Wife’s middle name and maiden name. • Your middle name or initial, and last name. • The name of a friend or relative (find someone with a very common name) who is willing to have the phone put in their middle/last or middle/maiden names. Another system that many have used successfully is to explain that you are a writer and that your telephone number must be listed in your well-known pen name. (In this case, you may choose to have the name listed.) The usual procedure is that you will be instructed to go to one of the company’s offices and prove your true identity, so they have that for their files. They will then allow you to list whatever name you’ve chosen. The trick here is to choose the most common name you can think of, with no middle initial, so that the name will be lost in a sea of similar names.</em></p>

The sound quality is still better than any cell phone, and the new models are better than ever, thanks to 1.9 GHz DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications). Some models support Bluetooth technology. This means you can route cell calls through your cordless phone, giving you better reception in otherwise hard-to-reach places. Nevertheless, technology advances too quickly to endorse any kind of normal telephone. The below is from theregister.co.uk: Cryptographers have broken the proprietary encryption used to prevent eavesdropping on more than 800 million cordless phones worldwide, demonstrating once again the risks of relying on obscure technologies to remain secure. The attack is the first to crack the cipher at the heart of the DECT, or Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications, which encrypts radio signals as they travel between cordless phones in homes and businesses and corresponding base stations.</em></p>

If she had a cell phone (and she should have!), she could have used that to make the call to 911. 2. Had prior arrangements been set up, she could have called a friend who would in turn call 911 from her home, directing the ambulance to such-and-such an address where the detective’s wife was visiting. 3.

Captain Robert L. Snow, in his book Protecting Your Life, Home, and Property, says that if you live in a high-crime area and call 911 on a hot summer weekend and/or a busy day, there may be a delay in getting a policeman to your home. He says there have been cases where police dispatchers have listened as a caller was murdered before the police arrived. Some persons, under these circumstances, have called the fire department and reported a fire. “This should be done only in desperate situations,” says Snow, “since there will likely be some legal consequences later because of calling in a false fire alarm.… But if you have absolutely no doubt there is an intruder who knows you’re in the home and is trying to get in anyway, there’s a very good chance you will be raped, beaten, and/or murdered.

If you are the target, and the PI has only your ghost address, he may send you a convincing postcard or letter, asking you to either call him or send a fax. If you call or fax from home, he’s got you. Or, perhaps he does not have an address for you but he does have a telephone number of a friend or relative.

<p><em>YOUR VOICE-MAIL BOXES CAN BE HACKED As far back as the year 2007, Clive Goodman, former News of the World royal correspondent, went to jail briefly for intercepting voice-mail messages of members of the British Royal family. Not much has changed—we are still at risk to determined snoops. For example, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile do not require cell phone customers to use a password on their voice-mail boxes. Because of that, many people simply do not bother to make one up. Big mistake, and here’s why. Any decent PI can use a spoofing program to make it appear he is calling from your number. Further, with just a bit of additional personal information about you, he can gain access to the automated phone systems for Bank of America and Chase credit card holders. If, then, you have a BofA account or a credit card with Chase, he can come up with debts, late payments, and credit limits. Bank of America’s computer will even read off a list of dozens of recent charges, including names of doctors and other businesses you may have patronized.

<p><em>LIFE WITHOUT A SMARTPHONE For many years I’ve used one of the mainstream cell-phone providers. I gave them a bank cashier’s check for a $1,000 security deposit (in lieu of a Social Security number), my middle and last name, and they handed me a new phone on the spot. A year later, my deposit was returned to me. The bills go to a remote address and are paid from there. It is never turned on except when I am away from home and expecting a call, or when I need to make one. Therefore it is rather difficult to locate the phone, should anyone try to do so. The service does include password-protected voice mail, which I usually check once a day. The way one of my readers obtains his cell phones is to search for them on eBay or Craigslist.

<p><em>USE A PAGER WITH YOUR CELL PHONE Although clerks in electronics stores may tell you, “People don’t use pagers anymore,” pay no attention to them. I am a great fan of those small, cheap pagers that cost less than $10 a month. A big plus is that—unlike cell phones—the basic models cannot be tracked. A cell phone, which both receives and transmits, is tied to a single tower. As you move down the highway with the cell phone on (even though not in use), it transfers your number from tower to tower. With pagers, although they, too, use towers, there is a vital difference: Each tower broadcasts all the messages, and there is no clue as to which tower is used when your pager rings. For example, suppose a friend is trying to locate you at a huge airport. A message goes out on all the loudspeakers: “Miss Loretta Lindstrom, please meet your party at gate 10 on the B concourse.” Unless you decide to show up (only to discover a stalker, a PI, or the police), no one can possibly know you were even in the airport, much less in which part. The small, cheap pagers offer you this same protection. The best way to use your pager is in conjunction with a cell phone that is not turned on. If you receive a message that appears urgent, either turn your cell phone on just long enough to reply, or go to a pay phone. Here is a simple code used by one of my readers. He carries a pager clipped to his belt and keeps his cell phone in his car. The pager is always on, and the cell phone is always off unless in use. First digit: Is always 1, 2, or 3: 1. Call me in the next day or two. 2. Call back as soon as convenient. 3. Emergency! Second digit: Will be between 1 and 7:   1. Call wife at home.   2. Call wife on cell phone.   3. Call wife at work.   4. Call secretary.   5. Call parents.   6. Call friends Larry and Carol.   7. Package received at ghost address. Look how simple it is to translate these two-digit codes: 22. Call wife’s cell phone number as soon as convenient. 15. Call parents, perhaps this evening. 31. Call home this very minute! How often have you been asked for your telephone number, and have been reluctant to give it out? (One such example is when you’re arranging a blind date.) From now on, give out your pager number. Take the time to record a greeting in your own words, such as: “This is Hillary. Please leave a message.” (You will, of course, check for messages from time to time.)</em></p>

<p><em>What is the dumbest dumbphone I can get? According to Engadget, it’s John’s Phone. According to a review: It certainly is basic. In the age of smartphones and cheap featurephones, John’s Phone is more clearly defined by what it lacks than what it has: no fancy color touchscreen display; no camera; no 3G radio, WiFi, Bluetooth or even GPRS data; no FM radio; no user-accessible storage; and no music player or apps of any kind. It can’t even send a text message. It’s just a quad-band GSM phone with an ink pen and paper notepad tucked neatly into its capacious recesses. That’s right, pen and paper. What do you think about Zfone? I’ve never used it, but I asked a PI friend to check it out. He answers, “Other than the GSMK CryptoPhone, Zfone is the only encryption system I’d trust for telephony.” Note: Zfone doesn’t work with Skype. However, it does work well with services like MagicJack. When I leave my car at the dealer’s for servicing, shouldn’t I give them my cell phone number and then leave it on, so I’ll know when my car is ready? If you carry a small pager, just give them that number and tell them to enter some simple number several times (such as 1111 or 7777) after the beep. This works equally well when you’re waiting to pick up eyeglasses at the mall, at the golf course when your tee time is ready, or when your wife is ready to be picked up after the baby shower.</em></p>

<p><em>Far too many people leave sensitive information sitting in their inbox—a treasure trove for criminals. And unfortunately, sometimes you do have to deal with sensitive information. Maybe you’re submitting a school or job application. Perhaps a friend sent you something confidential. How do you protect these messages? One option is to use a relatively secure e-mail service, the first feature of which is SSL, or Secure Socket Layers. You can tell a secure site by the first part of its Web address—it starts with “https.” (The “s” at the end stands for “secure.”) This is advertised to create an encrypted pathway between your computer and the e-mail provider’s server. It makes it nearly impossible for hackers to steal messages en route. (I should note that https is available in Gmail and Hotmail but it isn’t necessarily turned on by default.) All online banking services and all payment pages where you enter credit card numbers should start with https. Another important feature is message encryption. E-mail is typically sent as plain text. If hackers intercept the e-mail, they can read it with no problems. Encrypted e-mail is much harder for hackers to read. In most cases, they won’t be able to decrypt it. Encryption is best when both parties are on the same service. The e-mail you send back and forth stays encrypted the whole way. It is also encrypted on the mail provider’s servers. Even if hackers broke in, the message wouldn’t be readable.</em></p>

<p><em>There are other security aspects you need to consider. Here are three of the more important ones. 1. Make sure you have a strong unique password guarding your account. Include upper and lower case letters, a number, and at least one symbol. Otherwise, fancy encryption may be useless. 2. Use extreme care to avoid spyware and keyloggers. These can steal your passwords and send them to hackers, giving them full access to your accounts. 3. What about the recipients? You might send an encrypted message to a friend, but he or she could store it as plain text. If so, all a hacker needs to do is just to break into your friend’s account.</em></p>

<p><em>YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER The moment you sign up for an Internet account, your invisibility begins to fade. At the government’s request, every Internet service provider (ISP) must furnish—with no advance notice to you—the following information about your account: • The name you gave them, and the address where bills are sent. • Records of your Internet sessions (including session times and duration). • Your telephone number or other subscriber account identifying number(s); including any Internet or network addresses assigned to you. • The source of your payments, including any credit card or bank account numbers. • The content of and other records relating to your electronic mail messages, including attachments.</em></p>

<p><em>INTERNET SCAMS New Internet extortion techniques arise on a daily basis. Here is a typical example, this one aimed at those of you who use a computer at your place of employment. 1. You receive an unsolicited e-mail containing a link to a seemingly innocuous site such as a review of the latest SUVs, or a great place to buy laptops at a discount. 2. When you click on the link, a file transfer from a site in Bulgaria is initiated in the background. Files with child pornography are then secretly downloaded to your computer. (Perhaps the extortionists use a malicious Java application that uses reverse tunneling to bypass your company’s firewall.) 3. Three days later, you receive an e-mail threat. It accuses you of downloading child pornography and directs you how to find these illegal files on your computer. “Either provide a valid credit card (name, expiration date, and billing address) or we will present this evidence to your boss!” Three out of every twelve employees will actually furnish the credit card details, but only one in twelve will report this threat to his or her employer. Other scams involve opening an attachment instead of clicking on a link. Therefore: • Never open an incoming attachment unless it is not only from someone you know, but you are either expecting it or there is a valid explanation in the message that accompanies it. • Never, ever, click on a link that is contained in an unsolicited e-mail from an unknown source.</em></p>

<p><em>THREE BASIC RULES 1. Do not click on any ads you see on a Web site, including this ironic one: “Has your credit card number been stolen on the Internet? Enter it below and click ‘Go’ to find out.” 2. Never enter accurate information into your computer or on a Web site, and especially not for an e-mail account. 3. When you sign up for whatever, use a different name, a different username, and a different password each time. Your address can be 123 Main Street, and your telephone number any area code plus 555-1212. If a Web site doesn’t accept the “555” number (since 555 is invalid), feed them some other number such as that of a library or a cremation service.</em></p>

<p><em>Using a different password, even just for your e-mail account, is incredibly important. I have heard of many friends and families whose computers were never infected, however their friends and acquaintances starting received phishing scams and other male enhancement ads apparently from them. They call me in a panic but the damage has already been done. “Change your password with your Internet provider right away,” I tell them. An incredibly simple system I use to make my passwords strong and easy to easily remember is use part of the business name to which they go to. For example, I use the first and last letter of the service’s domain name I’m logging into at the end of my passwords. The start of my password is always uppercase, the middle lower, it contains a number, and is 9 characters long—thus it meets most website password strength requirements. So if your base strong password was “RJK&amp;r2d” and you were logging into “Yahoo.com” you would add the letters “y” and “o.” Your final password could be “yoRJK&amp;r2d”, “yRJK&amp;r2do”, or “RJK&amp;r2dyo” depending on where you decide to put the two letters. This system works very well and ensures I have just “one” password to remember, but a different password for every system. If that system gets compromised hackers will think I’m using a strong password and give up when they try it elsewhere and it doesn’t work. For the more cautious reader, or if you’re logging in from a public terminal, you can even copy/paste those two letters from the domain name into the password box after you finish typing. This will help to confuse any physical keyboard keystroke logger as they won’t know you’ve added those two letters by mouse movement.</em></p>

<p><em>No matter how innocent you are, if you are named you have to defend yourself, and that costs time, money, and extreme aggravation. So then, if you wish to remain invisible, your name must not surface anywhere. Is that difficult? Yes! But is it impossible? No, but you almost certainly cannot do this without the help of a proxy, or nominee. (Although the word nominee usually refers to a person nominated for a political office, in this book I use it in its secondary meaning: someone who takes your place as the apparent owner or manager of a company you own, or who opens a bank account for you and signs up for utilities and other services.) Despite the tremendous advantages of using a nominee, few people are willing to do this. Some of the excuses offered are: • “It’s too much trouble.” • “I don’t know who to use.” • “I don’t want this additional expense.” • “I plan to get a nominee later on.” The problem with “later on” is that problems often arrive with no advance warning.</em></p>

I didn’t give out the true nature of the position in this ad although I did mention that I was ‘privacy-oriented’ and expected complete discretion. I asked for an educated (preferably with a liberal arts degree) person who was well-organized, professional in demeanor and appearance, had at least an average credit rating, and who was seeking part-time work.” But that was not all. Mike specified that the successful applicant “must have had some international travel experience, preferably outside Western democratic countries. My political science background and my own travels have taught me that many Americans have little understanding of how sadly lacking personal privacy and security are in many countries. We just don’t realize how precious our privacy really is. Travel abroad gives one a different perspective.”</em></p>

Our nominee arrangement began that very day.” When the terms were agreed upon, Mike drew up a simple memorandum for both of them to sign. Thus, there would be no later misunderstanding about what each had agreed to do. Mike’s candidate, acting as his nominee, then undertook the following tasks, obtaining each service in his own name: • Rent a PO box. • Order cable TV. • Sign up for all utilities. • Obtain a cell phone.</em></p>

<p><em>HOW MUCH TO PAY THE NOMINEE Although you may prefer to pay the nominee a flat sum to start, plus a lesser annual fee, Mike had a different plan. “I compensate the nominee for every new service he provides for me, plus reasonable expenses. For example, when he set up a PO box for me, I paid him for his time and driving expenses in addition to $120 for the annual fee of renting the box. “For each utility, he receives the same amount as I pay. If the electric bill is $40 for the month, then I pay him $40 in cash and send a money order to the power company for the same amount. Thus, my nominee earns a 100 percent commission for every service. This doubles my costs for mail, cable, utilities, and phone but it provides a continuing incentive for him to continue.” Mike’s arrangement with his nominee had now been in force for many years. When preparing this chapter, I e-mailed Mike for an update. “So far,” he answered, “no problems at all. The relationship is working well.”</em></p>

<p>*I wish to have you, Mr. Luna, furnish a nominee who will open a bank account for me. I am willing to show you my passport, give you my SSN and DOB, and give you three ironclad references to prove that I am a solid citizen. If you wish to run my name on background searches, I will pay the fees. So will you furnish a nominee for me, for everything? Yes, I could probably find you a rock-solid nominee, but unless you are a millionaire, you will consider the cost to be excessive. Below is a better suggestion: If you have a good friend in another country, invite him or her to come and visit you, all expenses paid. Your friend can then open an account, sign checks, have a rubber stamp of the signature made, and fly back home. Or, check with your friends. One of them may have a trustworthy friend or relative in another country. If that person has never before been able to afford a visit to the United States, such an offer may be irresistible! <em>NOTE REGARDING BANK CHECKS Ideally, the imprinted checks should carry only two initials and no address. The bank’s “free” checks will not allow this, but you may be able to order such checks from independent check printers such as CheckWorks.com or ChecksUnlimited.com.</em></p>

<p><em>Did you know that financial institutions are required by the federal government to spy on their customers? The Bank Secrecy Act, which has been around for a long time, authorizes the Treasury Department to require any financial institution to report any “suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation.” These reports, called “Suspicious Activity Reports,” are filed with the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). This is done secretly, without your knowledge or consent, any time a financial institution decides that you have done anything “suspicious.” For example, each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment transfer that involves a “transaction in currency” (a physical transfer of currency from one person to another) of more than $10,000 will be reported. Reportable currency transactions include: • Checks or drafts cashed for over $10,000. • Cash deposits over $10,000. • Cashier’s checks purchased with cash over $10,000. • New account opened with more than $10,000 in cash. • Exchange of currency—small to large or vice versa; foreign to the United States or vice versa. • Multiple cash transactions totaling more than $10,000 made in one day by or for the same person, if the bank is aware of them. Does it appear from the above that you could safely purchase a $9,000 bank cashier’s check with cash and still avoid a Suspicious Activity Report? No, because the Bank Secrecy Act also requires all banks to log purchases of any monetary instrument involving currency in the amounts from $3,000 to $10,000, inclusive. (If you happen to own a sports arena, racetrack, amusement park, licensed check-cashing service, vending-machine company, or theater, you may be exempted.) What about foreign transactions, for an individual? Again, a report will be made if $10,000 or more is involved, whether or not it involves cash, traveler’s checks, money orders, investment securities, or negotiable instruments in bearer form.</em></p>

<p><em>Any bank account you have in your own name (other than the type mentioned at the start of this chapter), tied in with your Social Security number, can be tracked down by agencies specializing in asset searches for lawyers. This includes Certificates of Deposit as well as IRA accounts. Robert O’Harrow Jr., from The Washington Post, writes that “… lawyers, debt collectors and private investigators buy the data to help in civil lawsuits, divorces, and other financial matters. Prices range from just over $100 to several thousand dollars for a look at banks nationwide and a report that includes information about stocks, mutual funds, and safe-deposit boxes.” O’Harrow relates the account of a security official at BankBoston “… who noticed an ad for one of the services and anonymously ordered a search on himself.</em></p>

Consider newsletter subscriptions, contributions, trips, purchases of alcohol, guns, ammunition, or whatever. Consider rentals, from autos to motels to videos.)

<p><em>USE A NOMINEE This method requires the assistance of a proxy or nominee—another person who will act on your behalf. Let’s call this nominee Debbie E. Faith. Debbie will open a bank account in her own name. Here are the steps: 1. Choose an independent bank in a state where neither you nor Debbie lives. This will isolate both of you from routine searches and will hide Debbie’s possible death (should such occur) from the bank authorities long enough for you to cash a final check, closing out all but the last $10 from the account. 2. Prepare Debbie for obvious questions such as, “Since you live in California, why are you opening this account here in Pioche, Nevada?” The answer might be “I’m thinking about moving here within the next three months.” (She should have no problem saying something like that, because she can certainly think about it.…) 3. Withdraw cash from your present account(s), perhaps $1,000. Purchase a bank cashier’s check from a bank where you are not known, made out to Debbie Faith and with a fictitious remitter. 4. Next, Debbie practices, hour after hour, an indecipherable signature, the kind businessmen use all over Europe. She then assembles the necessary identification (a passport is best, if she has one, since it gives far less information than a driver’s license), travels to the city where the bank is located, and opens a personal account, using any legitimate address other than where she actually lives. She will receive a minimum order of checks from the bank that will have her name and address printed in the upper left-hand corner. The checks will be mailed to the address she gave them. 5. When the printed checks arrive, tear out the two checks with the highest numbers (so it appears the account has been used), along with a printed deposit slip. You will need these to order new checks from a mail-order company such as Checks Unlimited (ChecksUnlimited.com) or Checks in the Mail (checksinthemail.com). Use one of the two checks to pay for the order, and mark the other check (sent as a sample) “VOID.” Cross out both the name and address on the sample check, as well as the present number. Write in a starting number of 6001 or higher, so that the account will appear to have been established years ago. Above the deleted name and address, write in Debbie’s initials “DEF.” Choose a type style such as Old English that is difficult to read.</em></p>

<p><em>HAWALA BANKING This is the oldest banking system in existence, used for exchanging money across international borders. Since no money actually moves anywhere, it cannot be traced.

Suppose you wish to send $25,000 from Vancouver, British Columbia, to a friend in Helsinki, Finland. You would hand $25,000 cash to a Vancouver money changer (Hawaladar) in Vancouver, and receive code words (or an agreed signal such as a secret handshake) and a contact address in Helsinki.

To review: • There are no written documents. The exchanges are based on mutual trust (perhaps for that reason unpopular in the United States?). • Only local currencies are used. Thus, if you are sending money from the UK to Mexico, you pay in pounds and the receiver in Mexico collects in pesos. • This exchange cannot be traced because no money crosses a border. The hawala system has been under attack since 9/11 and by the time you read this it may be illegal in many countries. However, it does make for interesting conversations among friends.

<p><em>HOW NOT TO HAVE A SECRET ACCOUNT REVEALED Nazita Aminpour and her husband, David, have a joint account at a Chase branch in Kew Gardens, Queens, along with a custodial one for their three children. But Nazita also had a secret bank account of $800,000—money that was apparently hers alone. Unbelievable though it seems, the suit alleges that a bank employee at Chase called David to encourage him to move some of that $800,000 in his wife’s account into other investments with Chase. David knew nothing about that account until the phone call came in. Here is what Nazita should have done: 1. Used a different bank. 2. Given a ghost address when she opened the account. 3. Listed a secret voice-mail number that only she could access. Do you have a secret bank account? If so, does the banker have your true address and telephone number? If so, move that account to another bank!</em></p>

<p><em>What do you think about credit unions, as opposed to banks? In answer, I’ll pass along the experience of one of my readers, who, as a college student years ago, worked in the customer service department of “one of the largest banks in the U.S.” His job, as a “call center rep,” was to respond to phone calls and check account data. “Not only did I have access to the customer’s name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth,” he writes, but “I saw every financial transaction on the account, including credit card purchases and ATM withdrawal locations.” According to my reader, there were thousands of call center reps at the bank with this kind of access. “For fun (and because we were low-paid and unethical), we’d check out the accounts of friends, lovers, coworkers, etc. Further, during late-night calls with angry/rude callers, I occasionally heard a rep reminding a caller to cool it, because we knew where they lived. Scary huh?” (Hopefully, of course, your bank has only your ghost address!) Take to heart this warning from one who knows: “Thousands of low-paid workers have access to your personal life and feel no shame in monitoring you. Remember that the next time you open an account at the big bank with the most conveniences. (Note: I joined a small credit union after that experience. I like to think things are a bit different there.)” What if a bank requires my fingerprint on the back of a check? I agree that this is an extremely irritating request, but what if your financial circumstances do not give you the option of just walking away? Keep these two points in mind: 1. As long as the check does not bounce, it will disappear into the bank archives forever. 2. If that still worries you, then try this: When you give your thumbprint, press hard and slightly twist your thumb. Practice at home first. The goal is to smear the print just a trace. If done right, this will make a match impossible, and yet the clerk may not notice it at all. There is also such a thing as filling in the grooves of your thumbprint with glue, then allowing it to dry. Then a second coating is given and while still moist you press it against the thumb of another person. But I don’t think you need to get into all that, unless you are on the FBI’s top ten list. (And if you are, better not to cash that check at all!)</em></p>

<p><em>Can I pay cash to a dealer for a new car? Not unless you are prepared to be quizzed, sign a federal form, and perhaps be reported as “suspicious” to authorities. In fact, I do not recommend ever buying a car from a dealer, new or used. Most if not all will require a photocopy of your driver’s license, and sometimes your Social Security number as well. Buy your vehicle from a private party, even if you have to travel to another state to do it. You’ll certainly save money over the price of a new one. Most of the vehicles we buy are from original owners, and with 20,000 miles or less. Private parties will happily accept cash with no problem—even if you are paying $20,000 or $30,000 or more.</em></p>

<p><em>From now on, when I mention LLCs, I refer specifically to a legal entity that has all of the following characteristics: 1. No one will know who owns it unless the owner tells them. 2. It will be filed in New Mexico—a state that protects privacy and does not require an annual report. 3. It will be managed by a single member. 4. When used (such as to buy a vehicle or real estate), it will list a ghost address as the principal place of business. 5. It will cost about $100 to form, and less than $100 a year for the resident agent (a minimum of three years is normally paid ahead). 6. The LLC name will never appear on a state or federal tax return.</em></p>

<p><em>PROOF OF OWNERSHIP “How can I prove I own the company,” I’m often asked, “if my name doesn’t appear anywhere?” If privacy is the goal, I recommend New Mexico LLCs because they do not show ownership in the Articles of Organization (which are a public record). The best way to prove ownership, then, is to have the original LLC documents coupled with an operating agreement. This explains who owns and operates the company. If the sole objective of the LLC is to hold title to vehicles, an operating agreement is seldom necessary, but it is necessary for opening bank accounts as well as for holding title to real estate. This is a specialized field so I suggest you check with an attorney (see Appendix).</em></p>

<p><em>PURCHASING A VEHICLE IN THE NAME OF AN LLC Everything I have to say in this section makes one assumption: You will pay cash. I paid cash for the first car I ever bought—a 1931 Chevrolet, and I’ve been paying cash ever since. As long as you do not finance your purchase, taking title is usually a simple process. Nevertheless, many of my readers have been reluctant to use an LLC simply because they’ve never done it before. One such person was Jim in San Francisco, who asked me to help him purchase a used Lincoln Town Car with almost no miles on it. It was for sale by a private party in Washington and Jim wanted to title it in that state for personal reasons. He asked for my help because he was not sure he could handle the registration and yet keep his name out of it. The description below is how I handled this particular transaction, step-by-step. 1. Since Jim was in a hurry, I pulled a “shelf” LLC from my files that I’ll call Golden Gateway LLC. (A shelf LLC is one that has been formed in the past for future use, and just put “on the shelf” until needed. I recommend this procedure to all readers, and I personally keep shelf LLCs on hand at all times. The ones I have all show an address in Spain as their principal place of business.) We then flew to Seattle, rented a car, and drove out to Port Angeles to make the deal. 2. The seller, a ninety-seven-year-old (!) woman who had purchased the car in 1991 and then stored it, signed off on the title. She also signed the bill of sale I had prepared beforehand. We filled in “Golden Gateway LLC” as the buyer and gave a ghost address that Jim had already arranged for beforehand. 3. Rather than go to the Department of Motor Vehicles in Port Angeles, we went to a private licensing bureau. (They charge a small fee for handling the paperwork, but the lines are shorter and they are sometimes easier to deal with than clerks at the DMV.) Jim went through the line with me, but only as an observer. He wanted to see how I would answer the questions. (He had arranged for the LLC’s address to be a ghost address in Alaska.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 153 (location ~ 2333-2349)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Clerk: What’s the UBI number for this company? (Washington requires an ID number for all legal entities doing business in their state.) Me: Golden Gateway LLC doesn’t do business in this state, and Alaska doesn’t require a UBI number. Clerk: Then why not license it in Alaska? Me: For at least six months the car will be in this state, and the law requires we therefore license it here. (100 percent correct, in all states.) She then pushed a computer printout over to me and showed me where to sign. I scrawled an illegible signature that matched the one on the bill of sale (although she didn’t ask to see it). Clerk: Print your title after your signature, please. Since I was neither a member nor a manager of Jim’s newly acquired company, I wrote in “Sales Mgr.” (Jim retroactively appointed me “Sales Manager for a Day.”) We paid the various license and transfer fees in cash and were on our way. The title arrived at Jim’s ghost address in Fairbanks and was sent on to him, as were all annual registration notifications. Note: If you run into trouble, don’t make a scene. Stay calm and leave if necessary. So much has to do with the person you’re dealing with. Consider ways around the roadblock and try again another day at a different office or with a different clerk.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 154 (location ~ 2350-2362)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED? First and foremost, total privacy. Suppose a private investigator sees Jim’s car parked in Las Vegas at what he considers a suspicious address, and obtains whatever information is on file with the DMV in Olympia, Washington. He will get the name “Golden Gateway LLC” and Jim’s ghost address in Alaska. If the PI then checks with the secretary of the commonwealth in Juneau, he will learn that it is not an Alaskan company. He’ll then check with Olympia. No, not a Washington company, either. That leaves him forty-eight states plus the District of Columbia to check out. The search usually ends right there. However, assume the PI continues doggedly on and eventually does do a search of New Mexico’s database. All he will find there is an address in Spain.</em></p>

<p><em>INSURING YOUR VEHICLE The easiest—and recommended—way to obtain insurance is to use your own name. This will keep your rates low, especially when you have multiple vehicles titled in separate LLCs. As far as I have been able to learn, this will not compromise your privacy because only the LLC name will show up on the registration. CHOOSING A NAME It’s often fun for the whole family when it comes to choosing suitable names for the various LLCs that will be used for future purposes. North Dakota Sodbusters LLC family home Victoria’s Sea-Crate LLC SeaSport cabin cruiser King of the Road LLC husband’s Dodge Ram 3500 Her Royal Majesty LLC wife’s Toyota Highlander One Cool Chick LLC daughter’s Mazda Miata Road Less Traveled LLC son’s Jeep Wrangler All of the above could, of course, be titled in a single limited liability company to keep costs down. The main problem to having everything in the same LLC is the protection you lose if a PI is on the trail of your assets. Let’s say that in the example above, everything is titled in King of the Road LLC. If a PI comes up with the driver of any one of the vehicles and checks the plate, he’ll follow this with a search for anything owned by King of the Road LLC. What will he find? All the other vehicles, the boat, and the address of the family home.</em></p>

<p><em>You mentioned driving a Jaguar, but doesn’t that draw undue attention to yourself? I confess that from an early age I’ve had a weakness for upscale cars—Packards in the old days, and in later years Mercedes, Jaguars, and Lexus. However … it’s never too late for common sense. Thus it was that just one month after the second edition of this book went to press, your humble servant stepped down to a used Toyota pickup. My wife followed suit by selling her Lincoln Continental and buying a used Camry. Now that we’ve finally set the right example (with four “vanilla” vehicles), here are some reasons why I suggest you follow suit. • You’ll save some serious money. Less initial cost, less depreciation, less money at the gas pump, and a lower insurance rate. • You’ll no longer be the subject of envy by your less-fortunate neighbors, relatives, and friends. • You’ll no longer be a prime target for carjackers or burglars. (Burglars have been known to spot a luxury car and follow it home. Later, when the owner leaves, they break into the home, assuming that valuables must be there.) • You’ll have more privacy as you travel about, blending in with hundreds of similar vehicles on the road. What about long trips? In our case, we prefer a heavy car with lots of room when we’re going to be driving for many hours, so we rent a Lincoln from Hertz. Not only is this cheaper than owning the car, there is an additional advantage. If the car should break down or be involved in a fender-bender far from home, Hertz just delivers another Lincoln and away we go.</em></p>

<p><em>David White spent a long evening at the home of Maria Flores, an attractive young Mexican widow who lives in a village nearby. His beige Camry was parked in her driveway. When the time came to leave, David opened Maria’s front door, snapped on the outside light, and spotted two men at the back of his car. One was holding a flashlight and the other had a pad and pencil in his hand. David yelled and reached into his jacket as if to withdraw a handgun. Both men fled. He called me at sunrise the next morning and asked me what to do. “I need to keep using my car, but these guys have got my license plate number.” “It can’t be traced, David.” (Following my instructions, the car had been titled in the name of a New Mexico LLC with a ghost address.) “But these guys and their pals will be watching for it.” “I’ll meet you down at the licensing bureau when they open,” I said. “You’ll get new plates that show you contribute to a law-enforcement memorial. You’ll pay an extra forty dollars a year, but you’ll have a new number and will get the vanity plates right away.” I keep a drawer full of decals and bumper stickers for every occasion, and I selected one before heading out to meet David. His car now has a new license plate with a silhouette of some law-enforcement officers on the left side, and also a prominent decal in one corner of the rear window noting the following: FRATERNAL ORDER OF POLICE ACTIVE SUPPORTER</em></p>

<p><em>Will having license plates that cannot be traced protect me from stalkers? You mean, like, “guaranteed?” When it comes to privacy and security, there are few if any guarantees, but the precaution you mention will certainly balance the odds in your favor. However, if someone seems to be able to mysteriously track you down after a “foolproof” move, perhaps he followed your U-Haul trailer or truck when you moved. Some stalkers have trailed their victims from one coast to the other. Or perhaps: • He found out where your children go to school, and followed them home. • He followed you home from work, church, or a visit to a relative. • He followed you home from the airport. • He requested a hearing, forcing you to show up in court, then followed you home. The only sure way to avoid being followed is to never be located in the first place. If you have to meet with the stalker for any reason whatsoever, he certainly may attempt to follow you. Then again, ask any private investigator who the toughest person is to follow, and he’ll tell you that it’s the target who is aware. Perhaps not conscious of any specific thing, but just alert in general. Looking around when walking, watching the mirrors when driving, etc. Carjackers say the same thing—many crimes would have been avoided had the victims been aware of their approach. In my own case, I never allow any specific car to follow me for a period of time in rural areas (where our homes usually are). I drive a few miles over the speed limit, and if a car comes up behind me I turn on the right-turn signal, slow down, and force him to pass. If you live in a city and think a certain car is following you, make four consecutive right or left turns, i.e., go around the block. If the car you’ve seen in your mirrors follows you, do not go home. Drive to the nearest police or fire station or to a well-lighted gas station with a number of cars filling up. Hopefully you will have your cell phone with you, in which case you can dial 911.</em></p>

<p><em>What precautions can be taken against carjackers? Privacy and security go together. In the words of the Los Angeles Police department—referring to carjackings—“Don’t give up your privacy.” In other words, never get into your own car at gunpoint. Just pretend to faint (or maybe for real!) and fall down limp. Here’s a scam I hear about from time to time. It’s an oldie, but it still works. The latest is a report about a BMW that was parked late at night outside an upscale restaurant in Marin County, California. Someone called the restaurant to report that there was a white BMW 740i in the parking lot and its lights were still on. When the owner showed up (and of course the lights were not on), he was robbed at gunpoint and his car was taken. Female drivers, when alone, attract more attention than males. One solution is to tint your windows as dark—or darker—than the law allows. Then have a male mannequin in the passenger seat. In fact, with dark enough tinting you may even get by with one of those rubber masks from a costume store. Just slip it over the headrest—can’t hurt, might help. (Just don’t use this gag for the carpool lane, however. You may stumble across a cop with less than an adequate sense of humor.) While on this subject, below is an article from the Skagit Valley Herald, titled “Accused Rapist Had Been Jailed.” According to police, the man rammed his car into the woman’s vehicle about 7 p.m. Wednesday. The woman later told police she got out and the man then pushed her into his own car, climbed in, and drove south … he beat her up and raped her. Hint to you, husbands: Note the words “she got out.” Might this be a good time to review security with your wife, and make sure she always keeps her car doors locked and has her cell phone with her?</em></p>

When locked, a remote signal slides iron bars across the back. All windows face the open sea, which protects him against monitoring by laser, and he uses only laptops with screens and fonts designed to foil anyone trying to monitor the low-level radiations. At home, of course, a steel entrance door may be of little help because of all the windows.

<p>*DO NOT TRUST YOUR NEIGHBORS Jim and Jane B____, a young working couple with no children, had long planned on a two-week trip to Hawaii. When the time came to leave, they left a key to their home with Jane’s brother, Karl. This was to be used only in the case of an emergency. Upon their return they picked the key up from Karl and all seemed to be well. Several months passed. One evening, when they returned home from work, they found the computer turned on. Jim was positive it had been off since the previous evening. Alarmed, he checked the history and the cookies and found a sea of child pornography Web sites! He checked all the windows and doors. No trace of a break in. Jane checked the drawer in her nightstand. The money she kept there had not been touched. This had all the markings of an inside job by someone who had a key. Karl, when contacted, was persuaded to avoid a serious beating by confessing. He’d copied the key they had once left him and had been slipping into their home to use the computer while Jim and Jane were away at work. When an emergency call had come in on his cell phone, in his haste to leave he’d forgotten to clear the history and the cookies and to also turn off the computer. If you are ever caught in such a situation, the first thing to do is to back up the files you need and then destroy the hard drive. Sand the surface of the disk with a belt sander, melt it down, or hammer it into tiny pieces and then feed them slowly into a fast-moving river. Otherwise, what remains on that drive could someday be used against you. As for leaving a key behind, here is how we do it when we will be absent for a period of time. A key is hidden outside in such a way that not even the Homeland Security boys will ever find it. If an emergency should ever come up (and so far it never has), our neighbor Maggie has instructions to call my cell number and leave a message. I will then call her back and describe in detail the hidden location of the key. Maggie is in her eighties and doesn’t know a modem from a monitor. In fact, she’ll never see the computers because I leave them in an undetectable secret room.*</p>

<p><em>“The great omission in American life,” writes author Marya Mannes, “is solitude … that zone of time and space, free from the outside pressures, which is the incinerator of the spirit.” “In so many ways we, as a people, have declared war on solitude and meditation,” said Simeon Stylites in the December 1, 1954, Christian Century. “The worst possible calamity is to be alone. If you enjoy anything alone, you are ‘antisocial’ and ought to be rushed to the psychoanalyst’s couch, or better still to the mental hospital.” “We seem so frightened today of being alone,” wrote Anne Morrow Lindbergh in her book Gift from the Sea, “that we never let it happen.… Certain springs are tapped only when we are alone. The artist knows he must be alone to create; the writer, to work out his thoughts; the musician, to compose; the saint, to pray.”</em></p>

<p><em>SIX LEVELS OF ADDICTION “Facebook Addiction Disorder” [FAD] is a condition in which the healthy balance of an individual’s life is adversely affected by excessive amounts at time spent on Facebook. It has been said that approximately 350 million people are suffering from the disorder. According to many psychologists, if a person displays at least two to three of the following criteria during a six- to eight-month time period, he or she is a victim of the condition. 1. Tolerance: The person needs increasing amounts of Facebook time in order to obtain satisfaction. A sign to look out for is having multiple Facebook windows open. Three or more is a clear warning. 2. Withdrawal symptoms: These become noticeable when victims are restricted from using Facebook because they have to participate in normal everyday activities. Common signs are anxiety, distress, and the obsessive need to talk about Facebook and what might have been posted on their wall in their absence. 3. Reduction of normal social/recreational activities: Facebook addicts reduce the time spent catching up with friends, playing sports, or pursuing hobbies, simply to spend time on Facebook. In extreme cases, the person will even stop answering a parent’s phone calls, instead insisting that friends and relatives use Facebook to contact them. 4. Virtual dates: It is obvious that things are out of hand when real dates are replaced with virtual dates. Instead of going to the movies or out to dinner, a Facebook addict will tell a girlfriend or boyfriend to be online at a certain time. 5. Fake friends: If eight out of ten people appearing on their Facebook page are complete strangers, they have a serious case of FAD. 6. Complete addiction: When serious Facebook addicts meet new people, they tend to say their name, followed by “I’ll talk to you on Facebook.” Even their pets have Facebook pages. Any notifications, wall posts, inboxes, or friend requests give FAD victims an addict’s “high,” much like the highs felt by gambling addicts.</em></p>

<p><em>On October 11, 2006, Joshua Lipton, a twenty-year-old college junior, was driving under the influence of alcohol. As a result, he injured a woman in an accident. Lipton was not jailed at the time, but a court hearing was set for a later date. Two weeks later he attended a Halloween party dressed as a prisoner. Pictures from the party showed him in a black-and-white striped shirt and an orange jumpsuit labeled “Jail Bird.” So far, not good. It gets worse. An unknown “friend” who was also at the party took some pictures of him and posted them on his or her Facebook page. Enter Jay Sullivan, the prosecutor handling Lipton’s drunk-driving case. He (or someone under his direction) searched Facebook and found Lipton’s pictures. When the case came to trial, Sullivan used the pictures to paint Lipton as an unrepentant partier who lived it up while his victim recovered in the hospital. The judge agreed, calling the pictures depraved when sentencing Lipton to two years in prison. Note: I make no defense for Lipton or for anyone else who drinks and drives. The point here is that whoever posted Lipton’s picture on Facebook had no thought of the unintended consequences. The results of such thoughtless actions can cause the loss of someone’s job, the breakup of a marriage, or even rape and murder. In the case of young women, sometimes it’s the victim herself who fails to foresee where her foolish choice may lead.</em></p>

<p><em>SEXTORTION IS INCREASING Teens are more vulnerable to blackmail because they’re easy to intimidate and embarrassed to tell their parents. The result is that they will do almost anything to keep naked pictures of themselves from getting out. ALABAMA. Jonathan, twenty-four, extorted nude photos from more than fifty young women who were on Facebook or MySpace. WISCONSIN. Anthony, eighteen, posed as a girl on Facebook to trick male high school classmates into sending him nude cell phone photos, which he then used to extort them for sex. CALIFORNIA. A thirty-one-year-old man hacked into more than 200 computers and threatened to expose nude photos he found unless their owners (many of them juveniles) posed for more sexually explicit videos. Here is a suggestion to any of you parents with a teen daughter. Have a serious talk with her about the dangers of sexting. Explain that if, despite your warnings, she takes some revealing pictures of herself and sends them to anyone on the planet Earth, she may soon get a threat to take and send more pictures, or else. Kindly explain to her that she will at this point have two options: Plan A. She can confess to you and ask for your help. There will be some consequences such as grounding involved, but this will pass and you love her and will help her and protect her. Plan B. Instead of coming to you, she can submit to the threats and send the blackmailer whatever he asks for. Explain that this will eventually come to light anyway and at that point, life as she’s known it will disappear.</em></p>

<p><em>IS PRETEXTING AGAINST THE LAW? According to the Federal Trade Commission, the answer is yes. They define pretexting as using false information in order to get private information such as credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, and banking and telephone records. However, not all pretexting is against the law. Author Christopher Hadnagy, in his book Social Engineering, writes:. Pretexting is also used in areas of life other than social engineering. Sales; public speaking; so-called fortune tellers, neurolinguistic programming (NLP) experts; and even doctors, lawyers, therapists, and the like all have to use a form of pretexting. They all have to create a scenario where people are comfortable with releasing information they normally would not.</em></p>

<p><em>HACKING VS. SOCIAL NETWORKING PIs, skip tracers, and bounty hunters often have more success with social networking than they do with hacking. Kevin Mitnick, in his best-seller Ghost in the Wires, tells how he once took some temporary work serving subpoenas. One job was to serve a subpoena on a target who lived in Las Vegas, but was in hiding. All Mitnick had to go on was the man’s last known phone number. I called the number, an elderly lady answered, and I asked if the man was there. She said he wasn’t. I told her, “I owe him some money. I can pay half now and half next week. But I’m leaving town, so I need you to call him and find out where he wants to meet me so I can pay the first half.” And I said I’d call back in half an hour. After about ten minutes, I called the Switching Control Center at Centel, the local phone company. Posing as an internal employee, I had DMS-100 switch tech to do a QCM (Query Call Memory command) on the lady’s number. She had made her most recent call about five minutes earlier, to a Motel 6 near the airport. I called and when I was connected to his room, I said I was from the front desk, and did he still want the roll-away bed he had asked about. Of course he said he hadn’t asked about a roll-away. I said, “Is this room 106?” Sounding annoyed, he said, “No, it’s 212.” I apologized. My grandmother was kind enough to drive me over there. My knock was answered by “Yeah.” “Housekeeping, have you a minute?” He opened the door. I said, “Are you Mr.—?” “Yeah.” I handed him the documents and said, “You are served. Have a nice day.” The weak link? The elderly lady fell for a fake story and called Mitnick’s target.</em></p>

And if you are on Facebook (even if it’s set to private), your page will be a gold mine. Keep in mind that unless you’ve changed your privacy preferences to the strictest settings, strangers will be able to see your friends list, even if they haven’t “friended” you. Oh, but you can only see a handful of friends, you say. Right, but if you keep hitting “Reload,” that handful will change every time.

<p><em>NEVER HIDE CASH IN THE MASTER BEDROOM One of the essentials in maintaining your privacy is to pay cash at the gas station, the supermarket, and when you go shopping at the mall. Further, you need a cash reserve to prepare for the day when banks may close, or you are forced to flee, or if a government agency froze your bank accounts without warning. To do this, you must keep a fair amount of cash on hand that is easily accessible and yet invisible to burglars. But where should you keep it? There is no such thing as a burglar-proof home that cannot be entered, nor a security system that cannot be bypassed. However, the average burglar will be inside your home for less than ten minutes. Your goal, therefore, is to keep your cash hidden for more than that length of time. The burglar will head straight for your master bedroom. He’ll check your underwear drawer, then your other drawers, and he’ll look under your mattress. If he can find some cash in any of these places, he may just grab that and run. If you can afford it, therefore, leave a few hundred dollars under the mattress. Otherwise, the burglar will next check your refrigerator and your freezer so don’t keep any “cold” cash in either place. Instead, if you have a file cabinet, use one or more of the file folders for holding the cash. Title them with dull names such as “Old Tax Receipts” or “Travel Brochures.” Or, if you have a library, use a box cutter to cut the center out of some book you no longer want. (Outdated computer books or AAA travel books are ideal for this.) Put your money inside and then mix the book with others in your bookcase. My favorite method, however, is to use one or more “can safes” that are available on the Internet. One of our friends from the Canary Islands keeps half a dozen such cans. She scatters them under her sink, in her pantry, and among a box of bug-spray cans in her garage.</em></p>

<p><em>Sadly, burglars are not the only ones to worry about. Add to the list Level Three PIs, local police, U.S. marshals, and special agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). Here are a few suggestions for hiding small items in your home and yard: • Inside hollow doors. • In water hoses. • Inside fuse boxes. • In doghouses. • Under attic insulation. • Inside or under a furnace. • Under fence-post tops. • Behind wall phones. • Under an ironing-board cover. • In the bottom of a dog food bag. • Behind plumbing inspection doors. • Inside a plastic rolling pin. • Above acoustic tile ceilings. • In salt and pepper shakers. • Within a sanitary napkins box. • Above false ceilings. • Inside zippered cushions. • Inside the handle of a vacuum cleaner. In any of our various homes, it would seem to be no problem to leave cash and other valuables out in plain view. After all, the addresses are secret, and if the bad guys can’t find the house, they can’t raid it! However, I do keep valuables well hidden and so should you. Can you guess why? If a burglar is attracted to your home, it doesn’t matter what arrangements have been made for privacy because it’s not you he’s after, it’s the house. On the other hand, since the burglar has (hopefully) never attended a DEA seminar, nor will he have the time for that kind of a search, many of the hiding places on the DEA list are worth considering. Here are some of the ways to hide small, medium, and large items in your home.</em></p>

<p><em>SMALL Save old junk-mail envelopes and put a few $50 or $100 bills in each one. Hide the envelopes in such places as: • Sheet music in a piano bench. • In the box of old tax receipts in a storage unit. • In the hollowed-out section of an out-of-date software manual • In one of the hanging files in a file cabinet • Rolled up and inserted into a “foot powder” spray can with a removable bottom. When my car was stolen from the airport parking building at SeaTac, the thieves broke open the glove compartment searching, I assume, for a gun. All they found were stacks of what appeared to be junk mail, so they tossed all those envelopes on the floor and the envelopes were still there when the police recovered the car. The police didn’t notice, either, that two of those so-called junk-mail envelopes each had five $50 bills in them. When I travel, I use a slim dress belt with two sections, each of which will hold three bills folded lengthwise four times. At one time I carried six Canadian $1,000 bills, but in 2001, the Canadian government pulled them off the market. However, about that time euro notes appeared, so I switched to 500 euro notes.</em></p>

<p><em>LARGE A three-drawer fireproof file cabinet is best stored in a secret room that will hopefully be large enough to hold one or two persons as well. A room such as this will give you added security, especially if you are the wife of a traveling man who leaves you home alone. I pass this idea on to you as worthy of consideration when you plan your next new home. The only hesitation I’d have would be that the secret room would be common knowledge among the architect, the contractor, and the workers. Also, the building plans would be on file with the city or county. Gone are the days when pirates buried treasures in deep holes, then murdered the men who’d done the work.</em></p>

<p><em>the usual result of a complaint is merely a warning, so stay cool and keep these tips in mind: • Never, ever tell your neighbors about your business. • Do not have your customers or clients come to your home. • Never receive deliveries at home—but then, you already knew that. The best invisible business is run online. Payments can be either online or money orders received in the mail. No one will know your age, race, background, or if you’re a first cousin to the Roswell aliens. You can sell such a business to someone else in any state or—in some cases—any nation in the world. In 1989, one of my clients started a mail-order business from the spare bedroom in his cheap tract house in a small town in Nevada. The initial investment was $1,500. The product had to do with a paralegal service that was attractive to Europeans. The first year all he did was break even, so he lived on his savings. Then sales began to grow by word of mouth. In 1992, he withdrew a six-figure bonus (using a convoluted tax-free transaction) and kept working. In 1994, a privacy-oriented entrepreneur from Nebraska purchased 100 percent of the stock in the corporation that owned the customer list for $500,000. Not a single neighbor knew a business had been run from that home, much less that he had been netting up to $20,000 a month before taxes. And the taxes weren’t all that much—90 percent of the stock was in a charitable remainder trust, not subject to income tax. (A detail beyond the scope of this book.) However, the basic reason for starting the business was privacy. The fact that it did better than expected was a bonus.</em></p>

Some, of course, are in another country and unable to get a work permit—think of the million of Latinos in the United States, and hundreds of thousands of others who work illegally in Europe, Australia, and South Africa. I have several friends from Spain, for example who are currently in the States on student visas. They are working underground because they do not have and cannot get green cards.

They relied on just Facebook’s public profile information and off-the-shelf facial recognition software, then accessed profile information through Facebook’s search engine APIs. Nevertheless, they matched Facebook users with their pictures on otherwise anonymous Match.com accounts.

<p><em>THE NEXT STEP IN FACIAL RECOGNITION The next step is the face-scanning glasses that the Brazilian police plan to wear at the 2014 World Cup. A small camera fitted to their glasses will be able to capture 400 facial images per second and send them to a central computer database storing up to 13 million faces. The system can compare biometric data at 46,000 points on a face and will immediately signal any matches to known criminals or people wanted by police. In the future, this sort of thing won’t be limited to the police. Facebook has the largest collection of identified photographs in the world outside of a government, and they are currently at work on a major photo-tagging project.

<p><em>DOES YOUR DRIVER’S LICENSE MATCH THE STATE WHERE YOU LIVE? After reading previous editions of this book, some of you moved to a new state, but kept your driver’s licenses from the old state. No one other than a cop or a car rental agent would of course know this, because you’ve been using only your passports when an ID was required. However, what if a search of photos brings up your driver’s license? It will show that you are licensed in a state different from where you actually live.

<p><em>CAN FACIAL RECOGNITION BE DEFEATED? Perhaps, but only with extreme effort. Facial recognition works by measuring the distance from your eyes to another point on your face, such as your hairline, the bottom of your chin, your cheekbones, or the edge of your mouth. This is more difficult if you: • Wear a baseball cap. • Wear tinted or dark glasses. • Have facial hair. • Have on dark eyeliner. • Wear a ski mask (you wish!). • Smile.</em></p>

How would you like to hide your identity and thus avoid calls from persons such as ex-employees, ex-wives, ex-in-laws, or even private investigators? In days gone by, you could hide your identity by checking into a hotel under any name you liked, pay cash, and that was it. No longer, of course. All major (and most minor) hotels will not rent you a room without a valid credit card and government-issued ID. So, can you still hide your identity today? Yes, you can. Since I am a privacy consultant, many readers of How to Be Invisible know that I often meet my clients at the Westin in Bellevue, the Encore in Vegas, or the W in San Francisco.

<p><em>Burnett Williams, recently retired, sold his home where he had lived for thirty years and moved from Montana to a secret address in Arizona. Given the way the Federal Reserve is currently printing money by the trainload, he feared that a serious devaluation was coming within a few years, so what to do with all the cash? After checking with some knowledgeable friends, he decided to put 20 percent of it into silver bullion. The immediate problem he faced was that silver bullion is heavy and is usually shipped only by UPS. UPS keeps an international database with the address of every shipper and every receiver. Once your address gets into their system, it never gets out. Williams was not about to let any neighbor or friend accept this shipment on his behalf because the contents (given the shipper’s business name and the weight) would be obvious. End of privacy! He therefore gave the following name and address to the supplier. (This is the address of a UPS Customer Center. Note that he did not give them his distinctive first name.) B. Williams ATTENTION—HOLD 1975 E. Wildermuth Tempe, AZ 85281 When he picked up the shipment he used his passport for ID, since passports never include an address. And if anyone googles “B.

Your credit card will read Susan Wellington TTEE. The TTEE is short for trustee and is listed because you are the trustee for your trust account.

When you go by to pick up your package, show your passport when asked for ID. You may or may not be questioned about this, but if asked, show your credit card. A simple explanation might be: “I ordered this online and I had to fill out my name as shown on my credit card. I guess they didn’t understand that Ttee just means that I am a trustee on this account but anyway, the package is for me. My name is Susan and my last name does start with a W.”</em></p>

<p><em>4. HOW TO AVOID TROUBLE FROM TRASH TRUCK DRIVERS The following information came from one of my readers: I know of one city that pays the trash truck drivers a cash bonus every time they report someone who is building or remodeling without a permit. If the drivers see any activity, they report the address to the permit office. If no permit has been issued for that address, the building inspector makes a visit. The trash truck drivers go to every house &amp; business in the county once or twice a week, and any construction activity is easily noticed. Even swapping out an electric water heater, a very easy job, will get you busted if you toss the box &amp; packaging out to the curb to be picked up. I don’t know how many cities pay cash bonuses to the trash drivers but I suspect they are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to Homeland Security. Also, what if a burglar is paying a trash driver to watch for empty cartons from computers, flatscreen TVs, and home theater systems? The burglar can then target those homes for a visit! Most of the trash truck drivers, of course, are just out to do their job and deserve our respect. Nevertheless, I suggest you keep a low profile by disposing of telltale boxes at some other location.</em></p>

Further, you may assume the letter was received, whereas actually, it was not. Many of you readers may already have a ghost address in another state or a foreign country. If so, why not use that address as your return address on some of your mail? That way, if a letter bounces, you will get it back from your mail-forwarding service.</em></p>

<p><em>LEVEL TWO ESCAPE This is when you need to vanish for a few years, perhaps until some certain time period has run out. If you can afford to do so, get out of the country. One of my readers had to make a run in 2008. He fled to Thailand and has been happy there. However, that’s a long and expensive trip. My own preference would be Mexico. Take a bus or (preferably) fly to Guadalajara, Jalisco, then catch a taxi or a bus up to the Lake Chapala area. Stay for a few days at a bed-and-breakfast in Chapala or Ajijic, then look for a condo. You can rent a two-bedroom condo in a gated community for about $35 a day or $750 for a month, no questions asked. Why Lake Chapala? One reason is the climate—one of the world’s best. Another is that violent crime is low in that area. English is spoken in most business places, unlike some other parts of Mexico. Best of all, you’ll not stand out, because you’ll be among thousands of Americans and Canadians who live all along the north shore of the lake.</em></p>

<p><em>SLOW DOWN ANY PURSUIT Before you run from an abusive ex-husband or ex-wife, plan your escape in advance. Confiscate any firearms they may have and get rid of them. Clean out your bank accounts, scoop up anything small that you can later sell on Craigslist or use to get a loan at a pawn shop. Disable your ex’s vehicle, but not by setting it on fire or crashing it somewhere. Do something that will not be obvious, such as pouring long-grain rice into the radiator. Be sure not to do that in a garage, however, as the green fluid will slop out on the floor and give away the plan. So if that won’t work, then take off the oil filler cap and pour in as much sand as you can. (Don’t bother with sugar in the gas tank, however. That’s been debunked on Snopes, MythBusters, and Tom and Ray’s Car Talk.) On the other hand, if giving away your flight does not matter, then just cut every cable you can find under the hood. Or, drop a wrench across the battery terminals and jump back. Or, remove the valve caps to flatten all four tires. Or if you’re really mad, all of the above.</em></p>

<p><em>PRIVATE HOME Before you leave on a long trip, do you leave a key with a neighbor? I suggest you not only not leave a key, but do not even say you are leaving. (Use timers that turn on lights, TV, stereo, sprinklers, etc., at varying times.) Louis R. Mitzell Jr., in his book Invasion of Privacy, tells the story of a Maryland couple who, before leaving on a vacation in August 1994, left a key with a neighbor. When they returned from their trip they picked up the key, thanked the neighbor, and thought no more about it. “Then,” writes Mitzell, “in January 1995, the couple was adjusting a heating vent in their bathroom when they discovered a camera. Later that night, the couple found a second camera behind a heating vent in a dressing room and followed cables leading through their attic, down a drainpipe, and underground into their neighbor’s home. The neighbor had been watching the couple in the bathroom and dressing room for months—and it wasn’t against the law.”</em></p>

<p><em>APARTMENT The problem here is that even if you do not leave a key with anyone when going on vacation, the landlord does have a key. Landlords surreptitiously enter apartments more often than you might think—in fact, it once happened to me. That was fifty-six years ago, but there were such serious consequences that I haven’t forgotten it yet. Anthony Herbert, in his book Complete Security Handbook, has this to say in the section about locks: Change them without the management’s knowledge. (Remove the cylinder, take it to a locksmith, and get combination changed.) If the manager or janitor later complains, ask why he was attempting to enter your apartment while you were not present. Better to incur a minor lease violation than to be dead! No one should be permitted to visit your apartment unaccompanied, except in a life-and-death emergency!</em></p>

<p><em>You should know, however, that there are two types of border inspections, primary and secondary. You do not want secondary, not ever, because then your name will go into the computer and, to paraphrase the ads for the Roach Motel, travelers who check in to the computer never check out. Suggestions: • Dress like a tourist. Clean and neat, but no tie. • Do not cross with anything to declare, or with any item even remotely suspicious. No fruit, no weapons, no drugs. Best way to cross is on a tour bus. Next best way is on foot, at a busy crossing, during the busiest hours, but taking a car is certainly more convenient, despite the fact that your license plate may go into a computer. (Here’s where it pays off to have your car registered in the name of an LLC.) • Do not cross into Mexico with an RV if you can avoid it. Some Americans have been arrested in Mexico and held under false pretenses, with the goal of allowing the American to go free if he leaves his motor home behind. (An RV is okay for Canada.) • If there are several lines leading to multiple booths at the crossing, pick your lane and then stick with it. If you change lanes, the inspector from the original lane may spot you, think you’re trying to avoid him, and make you get back in line. Then, when your turn comes, you’ll get more attention than you really wanted to receive. Never cross in either direction with a flippant attitude, because both customs inspectors (CIs) and immigration inspectors (IIs) have you in their total power. They can search you, your vehicle, and your belongings for whatever reason, or for no reason at all. Therefore, before you approach the border, first check your wallet or purse, and then the glove compartment and the trunk. (If you carry my book with you, put on a different dust jacket!) Be prepared to answer any questions whatsoever, no matter how personal or insulting. Lawyers (and some egocentric businessmen) have been known to say, “Do I have to answer that?” The response, as given by Customs Inspector Ned Beaumont in his book Beat the Border, is: You don’t have to answer. But then again, you don’t have to cross the border. And you’re not going to cross the border until you answer that question and any others I see fit to ask. Understand? CIs and IIs are skilled at deception, aka lying. If they preface something by saying, “You don’t need to worry about thus-and-so…” start worrying! They may try the good cop/bad cop routine, like in the movies. Remember that it’s really bad cop/worse cop. These folks are not your buddies. Keep cool and collected on the outside, skeptical and cynical on the inside. Beaumont makes this point in his “People Smarts” section: An inspector talks to more liars in a month than the layman does in a lifetime. How good at spotting liars do you think that inspector is going to be in a year? Or five? Or ten? I’ve worked with inspectors who’d been on the job for twenty years. They could detect a lie … without fail, in the first five seconds of the inspection.</em></p>

<p><em>HOW TO DEAL WITH CLERKS AND TELLERS First of all, dress like they do, or just a bit better. No matter how convinced you are that clothes make the man or woman, reading John T. Molloy’s bestseller, Dress for Success, will make you even more of a true believer. To Molloy’s book I add the following: If you are a woman, dress and act like a woman, emphasis on “dress” as in the noun. If you are a man, and if getting others to accept your requests for privacy is high on your list of priorities, show up freshly shaved and with a short haircut. Right or wrong, I often refuse requests from anyone who draws attention to himself or herself by outward appearance rather than by inward qualities of honesty, integrity, loyalty, and virtue. (I wish they’d teach that in grade schools.) Next, private investigators suggest that when at all possible, deal with the opposite sex. This applies to trips to the bank, the county courthouse, the utility companies, and to any other location where low-level clerks deal with the public. If you are a woman, seek out a man. If you are a man, talk to a woman.</em></p>

<p><em>CREDIT CARD SECURITY MEASURE Restaurants and other businesses sometimes toss out credit card receipts without shredding them. To protect yourself against this possibility, as soon as you sign the slip, cross out the last four digits of the number (both on the original, and on your copy). If anyone protests, assure him or her that you absolutely positively have this legal right. However, the best protection is to never, ever, use a credit card at a restaurant, bar, saloon, massage parlor, or anywhere else where you are allowed to pay your bill in dollars, euros, pesos, rubles, pounds, yen, or rupees. FAKE IDS It is useless to order fake IDs on the Internet. Either you won’t get anything at all, or what you do get will be worthless. Here is an additional reason: Sooner or later these companies get busted. When they do, the authorities will of course grab the customer list.

<p>*HERE’S A REALLY LOW PROFILE Consider the methods of Kate M____, one of my readers, who takes her privacy very seriously indeed. She has found the people she meets uninterested in privacy, and skeptical about her concerns, but that hasn’t stopped her. “I’ve mostly quit telling others about it and just quietly go about the business of protecting myself without telling anyone what I’m doing,” says Kate. She’s chosen to work from home for maximum flexibility and privacy, staying in control of her own schedule and managing to avoid the crowds. “Often, I go grocery-shopping late at night (eleven P.M..) or even at two or three A.M., at the store that’s open twenty-four hours. Advantages include no traffic; parking right at the front door of the supermarket; no lines.… I can do my shopping in 30 percent less time. Plus, I see almost no one. Also, I can check my PO box and drive by my ghost address (a lockable mailbox on a rural road.) Even without tinted windows, driving at night means fewer people can recognize me. Even my nondescript old car and its color are harder to recognize at night. When I park the car out in public in the daytime, I’m now very sensitive to making sure there are no identifying items inside (letters or anything with my name on it). But I’ve also discovered that when I shop in the daytime, if I park in an out-of-the-way place at the outer edge of the parking lot, there are fewer people who will walk past my car on their way into the store/mall.*</p>

<p><em>NEVER HIRE AN EMPLOYEE There is only one way to keep your private life private (and stay out of the dreaded New Hires list). You must work for yourself. If you are (or plan to be) a carpenter, a salesperson, an artist, an architect, an interior decorator, a hairdresser, or any similar profession where you can work alone, I suggest you do work alone. The same applies to starting your own small business. You may not get rich, but you can certainly shoot for $100,000 a year. That will be sufficient to live a simple, debt-free life. In fact, the absolute best kinds of home-based businesses are those that can be run alone or just with help from family members.</em></p>

<p><em>INFORMATION-SHARING Airline passengers are not the only ones being secretly profiled to determine if they are a danger to flight safety or for any other reason. Since 9/11, the private sector has also been sharing information with the government. Many supermarkets, of course, make this information available, but so do clubs you might not think of, such as the National Association of Scuba Divers. Libraries and bookstores are under pressure as well. And especially FedEx and UPS. By the way, did you know that some national hotel chains share lists of movie titles—including pornos—rented by its customers? While the name of the movie isn’t on the bill, it is included in the customer profile. This information is shared with their many affiliates, including other hotels and restaurants.</em></p>

<p><em>A $20 UNIT THAT WILL PUT ANY BURGLAR ON THE RUN! The authority for the above statement comes from Jack MacLean, an electronics genius with an IQ of 167 and the author of Secrets of a Superthief. Before he went to prison, he was responsible for hundreds of burglaries that netted him $133 million worth of jewels. MacLean interviewed 300 other burglars during his years in prison and included their answers in his amazing book. He asked them such questions as how they chose which homes to burgle, how they broke in, whether or not they cut the phone lines in advance, and what might scare them into calling off the job. The following is one of the questions in the book: If you had cut the phone lines of a resident you were burglarizing and at some point heard from inside that same residence, coming from the window, an extremely loud horn, what would you do? “Ready for this?” asks MacLean. “One hundred percent said they’d be gone in a second.” (The actual answers were cruder but the author preferred not to print them.) Note: To obtain an “extremely loud horn,” pick up a portable air horn at any marine supply store or order it on Amazon.com. Be sure to get one that sells for about $20, because the $10 ones are not as loud.</em></p>

He started up a small company, sold it, and started up a second company, which was immediately successful. Within months, hundred of thousands of euros were flowing into and out of his bank accounts. A local accountant helped Harry file U.S. tax returns, and he dutifully reported—as required by law—all of his overseas earnings. In the fall of 2011, he returned to the states and only then did it come to light that one tiny detail had been overlooked. TDF 90-22.1 Treasury Department Form 90-22.1 must be filed every year if you have an interest in any foreign bank accounts that at any time of the year are worth $10,000 or more. This report is separate from your income tax return. The penalties for not filing it are brutal. Harry was faced with a total penalty of more than $800,000, and it must be paid. Keeping Harry’s experience in mind, I’ll now mention several of my favorite places.</em></p>

If you can’t stand prolonged heat, head for: SAN MIGUEL DE ALLENDE, GUANAJUATO This small city (80,000) is in the central highlands of Mexico, between Leon and Querétaro. If you must have heating, air conditioning, and a central location, then your rent will be similar to that in the United States. Prices drop dramatically when you move to one of the small villages thirty to forty minutes away from the city, but once again—few Americans are willing to do this. (Our friends Alex and Laura are Mexican nationals who spent seventeen years in the states before returning to Mexico last year and settling down in a village about a half-hour out of San Miguel. They live in an old motorhome alongside a relatively new home they use as an office for an Internet business. The rent is just $90 a month, but Alex himself admits it’s a steal, and it was very difficult to find.) In San Miguel, you’ll find Office Depot, Starbucks, Blockbuster, and McDonalds. In Celaya (forty-five minutes away) you can visit Costco, Sam’s Club, Walmart, and Home Depot. There are some 10,000 part-time or full-time North American expats in this small city—quite a number of them painters, sculptors, and writers.</em></p>

<p><em>Japan has a registration system for all citizens and foreigners at the local city office. Citizens are registered pen-to-paper on family trees called koseki. This is the foundation for employment, bank accounts, national health insurance, voting. All of the aforementioned activities are cross-checked through the city office. Says an American expat living in Japan: For Japanese people, it is impossible to dodge this system. If there is any doubt raised as to your registration, you will find your bank account temporarily inactive, health insurance card not working at the clinic, etc. This happened to me several years ago. I moved and thought I would tell everybody later, as in thirty days or so. I went to the doctor for a checkup and the receptionist asked if I moved recently. I said yes. She wrote down my new address. How did she know? My company’s HR staff called me to say that my bank called to confirm my address before my salary could be deposited. My name didn’t match the address on my salary deposit. How did they know? Landlords are expected to inform on tenants who come or go! Japanese don’t use checks. Instead, they go to any ATM and type in the recipient’s name or company name, bank name, account number, and insert cash. A record is then sent to all parties. One’s entire financial life is recorded—how much the telephone bill is, medical clinics visited, religious contributions, debts paid to loan sharks, consumer finance companies, etc. Note: When the first edition of How to Be Invisible was published in 2000, my agent had just one request from a foreign publisher. It was from Japan! I sold the rights, the book was published, and I have copies to prove it. I can only assume the publisher was left with a lot of unsold copies. From this point on I will deal with a few specific countries. However, don’t skip over them because advice for one country may well apply to another. Or, you may choose to travel to a specific country in order to open a bank account or pick up an untraceable cell phone.</em></p>

<p><em>Currently, the government is tracking and storing records of all international travel into and out of the UK. It records your name, address, telephone number, seat reservation, travel itinerary, and your credit card details. It keeps these for ten years. According to an article in the November 4, 2011, Daily Mail, some 3 million snooping operations have been carried out among UK citizens since 2001. This includes 20,000 warrants for the interception of phone calls, e-mails, and Internet use. There have been nearly 3 million requests for communications data (phone bills, location data) and over 4,000 authorizations for intrusive surveillance—which usually means planting a bug in a citizen’s home or car. Although the UK and Ireland are part of the European Union (EU), they do not belong to the Schengen area. However, once they pass through the border controls into mainland Europe, they will be in the Schengen area. Note to Americans: In accordance with the Schengen Convention of June 14, 1985, the twenty-five Member States (all in Europe) have abolished checks on persons at the time of crossing of their internal borders. Hence the checks on persons are only carried out at the time of crossing of the external border of a Member State, which then acts on behalf of all of the other States of the Schengen area. This means UK citizens can then freely travel—and work—all over Europe, with no more border controls. They are thus far from the UK’s CCTV cameras and are often far from government scrutiny as well.</em></p>

On March 11, 2004, ten bombs were detonated on trains arriving at Atocha, Madrid’s main train station. Cell phones had been used to detonate the bombs.

<p><em>SWEDEN Unlike some of the EU countries, I’d heard that anonymous cell phones might be available in Sweden. I checked with a friend there; below is his reply: I myself have four “burner phones,” which I use frequently when buying/selling stuff on the Swedish equivalent of Craigslist (blocket.se). They are bought with cash and so is the cell phone card (which has your phone number) that you need to operate the phone. At no point am I obliged to identify myself to anyone when buying and/or using a prepaid cell phone card. However, if I want to get 100–200 SEK “for free” as a prepaid voucher I can register my prepaid cell phone card. Most people do this, but I never do. It is not mandatory to register or identify yourself while using prepaid services. However, having a “subscription” does require registration. Most people have subscriptions since this simplifies your bills and you always “have credit” on your phone since you pay after you have used the phone for a month. Last, but not least, the prepaid MasterCards (spendon.se, use Google translation to read it) can be used to add credits to your prepaid cell phone card through the Internet, so you can get someone else to buy your phone and SIM card for you, as well as the prepaid MasterCard and then just go to the library, use their free computers and add credit to your phone later on.</em></p>

<p><em>BELGIUM The following are two questions I posed to a reader in Belgium, and his answers: Does the government know where you actually live? If so, could that be avoided? In my case, yes, the government knows where I live, but this could certainly be avoided if someone wanted to. Many people over here use street addresses as a mail drop without actually living there in exchange for a monthly fee to the owner who provides such a service. The only negative with this is that a local police agent comes to pay a visit to see if you actually live there. Most people can make an appointment with this officer to meet at the mail drop address on a certain date and hour, so in fact this is a minor inconvenience and the officer only pays a one-time visit. Can you get a cell phone without showing photo ID? Yes. Of course, the stores ask to register them, but you can give any fake name and address you want. Nothing is checked. We can also buy prepaid cell phone cards without showing any ID nor even register them. I have about five new cell phone SIM cards in my home to change my number if necessary or appropriate. In conclusion, if you keep a low profile, privacy is certainly doable in Belgium.</em></p>

<p><em>Are you allowed to not use socialized medicine, and just pay the bills yourself and perhaps even use another name? Or must you always have to prove your identity? This depends on the country. In the UK it will be [George Orwell’s] 1984 very soon. I have, in the past when I was an illegal immigrant, set up a company in Switzerland, which paid my medical. But in Switzerland the insurance is private, but mandatory. So I must have proof of this and this must be recorded by the government. All insurance in Europe is mandatory I believe. If you cannot afford the CHF320 per month for private insurance, then you must take socialized medicine. But you have to prove to the government of the country you live in that you are insured. Same for Australia. I live in Perth three months out of the year, to keep from freezing to death, and when you wish to live in this country with any visa other than a tourist visa then you need proof of insurance or they give it to you socialized. Identity is always needed. You can use another name, but you need identity for this as well. Solution: Set up an AG in Switzerland, hire yourself as a foreign consultant, and register the new name under the company’s insurance. They will cover you anywhere in the world and reimburse you.</em></p>

<p><em>What about banking? Privacy is what Switzerland is special for. Even though it has mandatory laws the reality is you can keep a bank account private here. Every Swiss person has two bank accounts. He tells no one about his second (secret) account. The Swiss government cannot touch this or ask about tax or anything. (Typically at a Raiffeisen Bank, not even the Raiff Bank in the next stadt [canton] knows who you are. Someone would have to find your bank, not easy, then have to find out how to get your information from the bank. If someone finds your Raiff Bank card they can say “Ha, got you!” But there is no way to find the amount in the account, unless they find the exact bank you use—and even then—can somehow get to this data.)</em></p>

Second, no one enforces them unless there is a good reason (usually money to be squeezed). Again, I think you could live under an assumed name. But you would have to deal with border crossings where they must see your passport and visa up to date, either at the airport or the border checkpoints. That system is computerized and linked to Interpol. A person could probably come to Peru on a tourist visa and lose themselves here pretty easily.</em></p>

If someone has set a private investigator after you, and if this PI has unlimited funds, then the danger point is when he discovers which hotel you are in. He will bribe someone—often a clerk at the front desk—into answering questions, such as: “What information did he fill out when he signed in? What vehicle is he driving? How did he pay? Was anyone else in the lobby with him when he signed in? What was charged to the room? Which movies is he watching? What was taken from the minibar? Any special requests made for that room?” He will then contact the maid who is scheduled to make up your room. For as little as $20 he may be allowed access to whatever you’ve tossed into a wastebasket. If you are out late at night, the PI may even show up during your absence. He’ll wave a dummy subpoena in front of the bored night manager and demand the key to your room.

There are lessons here for us all, and not just as to dating. Think about these things when making new friends, joining a club, or considering a partner in business. Let’s assume you’re a young man in the market for a bride. You’ve just met Brenda, and lightning has struck. Now what? • Get her true name but withhold or disguise your own. • Google her name. Ask around. See who else knows her, and what they say about her. • Find out where she works. If it’s a public place, stop by and see if she’s really there. If so, have a chat with one of her coworkers or superiors. • Get her address if you can, and google that. Withhold or disguise your own address and place of work. Instead of a phone number, trade e-mail addresses with Brenda. Yours, Joe, will be a one-off—used for no other purpose. Hers you can google. In fact, if she had some pet phrase, you might even google that, to see if she’s saying the very same thing to other men. (Some predators have been exposed in just that way!) In fact, if you are currently playing the field, do as a certain flight attendant does, who flies on international runs. She disguises her true name and keeps in touch via e-mail with seven male friends in various countries. Each one has been given a Yahoo! e-mail address that is unique to this person alone. Any time she wants to cut off communication, all she has to do is close that specific account. ¡Adios, amigo!</em></p>

Then have it reconnected in another name. Add a prepaid cell phone as well. • Order—or prepare on the computer—new checks for your bank account that will show neither your full name nor your address. Start with a high number. • For sensitive e-mail, use one of the Web-based accounts such as Yahoo! or Gmail. Use discernment when filling in the “personal” information. • If you are renting, move. If you are a homeowner, sell, then start over. • Order one or more LLCs so they will be on hand when you suddenly need them. • Start an invisible home-based business if you have not already done so. • Look at every challenge to your privacy as an adventure.
