<p><em>PETERíS BREAKFAST ìIt usually starts with nothing, and then I usually do a second courseóbecause Iím a little hungryóand Iíll have a little bit more nothing. I usually top it off with a bit of nothing.î Peter rarely eats breakfast and has experimented with many forms of intermittent fasting, ranging from one meal a day (i.e., 23 hours of fasting per day) to more typical 16/8 and 18/6 patterns of eating (i.e., 16 or 18 hours of fasting and only eating in an 8- or 6-hour window). Going 16 hours without eating generally provides the right balance of autophagy (look it up) and anabolism (muscle building).</em></p>

<p><em>WHY PETER AND I GET ALONG Peter explains the joy of drinking his first experimental batch of synthetic (exogenous) ketones: ìThe first one I tried was the beta-hydroxybutyrate ester, which a very good friend of mine sent me [Dominic DíAgostino, page†21], and I had been told these things taste horrible. I had talked to two people who had consumed them before, and these are stoic, military dudes. These werenít 6-year-old kids. They said, ëOh, man, thatís the worst-tasting stuff on earth.í So I knew that, but I think that piece of information was fleeting in the excitement when the box came. I tore open the box, and there was also a note in there that explained a somewhat palatable cocktail that you could mixóhow you could mix this with ten other things. I just disregarded that and took out the 50-ml flask. ìI chugged it, and I remember it was like 6:00 in the morning, because my wife was still sleeping. First of all, you drink it, and it tasted like how I imagine jet fuel or diesel would taste. If youíve ever smelled distillate, itís this horrible odor, and you can sort of imagine what it would taste like. This is what it tasted like, and so my first thought was, ëGoddamn, what if I go blind? What if thereís methanol in here? What did I just do?í And then my next thought was just, ëOh my god, youíre gagging. I mean, youíre really gagging. If you puke this stuff up, youíre gonna have to lick up your puke. Itís just gonna be a disaster.í And so Iím retching and gagging and trying not to wake up the family and trying not to spew my ketone esters all over the kitchen. It took around 20 minutes for me to get out and do my bike ride, which was the whole purpose of that experiment.î</em></p>

<p><em>The Point Most ìsuperheroesî are nothing of the sort. Theyíre weird, neurotic creatures who do big things DESPITE lots of self-defeating habits and self-talk. Personally, I suck at efficiency (doing things quickly). To compensate and cope, hereís my 8-step process for maximizing efficacy (doing the right things): Wake up at least 1 hour before you have to be at a computer screen. Email is the mind-killer. Make a cup of tea (I like pu-erh) and sit down with a pen/pencil and paper. Write down the 3 to 5 thingsóand no moreóthat are making you the most anxious or uncomfortable. Theyíre often things that have been punted from one dayís to-do list to the next, to the next, to the next, and so on. Most important usually equals most uncomfortable, with some chance of rejection or conflict. For each item, ask yourself: ìIf this were the only thing I accomplished today, would I be satisfied with my day?î ìWill moving this forward make all the other to-dos unimportant or easier to knock off later?î Put another way: ìWhat, if done, will make all of the rest easier or irrelevant?î Look only at the items youíve answered ìyesî to for at least one of these questions. Block out at 2 to 3 hours to focus on ONE of them for today. Let the rest of the urgent but less important stuff slide. It will still be there tomorrow. TO BE CLEAR: Block out at 2 to 3 HOURS to focus on ONE of them for today. This is ONE BLOCK OF TIME. Cobbling together 10 minutes here and there to add up to 120 minutes does not work. No phone calls or social media allowed. If you get distracted or start procrastinating, donít freak out and downward-spiral; just gently come back to your ONE to-do.</em></p>

<p><em>It doesnít take much to seem superhuman and appear ìsuccessfulî to nearly everyone around you. In fact, you just need one rule: What you do is more important than how you do everything else, and doing something well does not make it important. If you consistently feel the counterproductive need for volume and doing lots of stuff, put these on a Post-it note: Being busy is a form of lazinessólazy thinking and indiscriminate action. Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable actions.</em></p>

<p><em>And whenódespite your best effortsóyou feel like youíre losing at the game of life, remember: Even the best of the best sometimes feel this way. When Iím in the pit of despair, I recall what iconic writer Kurt Vonnegut said about his process: ìWhen I write, I feel like an armless, legless man with a crayon in his mouth.î</em></p>

<p><em>#8óìLiving well is the best revenge.îóGeorge Herbert During a tough period several years ago, Nassim Taleb of The Black Swan fame sent me the following aphorism, which was perfect timing and perfectly put: ìRobustness is when you care more about the few who like your work than the multitude who hates it (artists); fragility is when you care more about the few who hate your work than the multitude who loves it (politicians).î Choose to be robust.</em></p>
