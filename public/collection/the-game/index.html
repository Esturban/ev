<p><em>Cigarette butts and used condoms floated grimly in the Jacuzzi. And Mystery’s rampage during the last few days had left the rest of the place totaled and the residents petrified. He was six foot five and hysterical. “I can’t tell you what this feels like,” he choked out between sobs. His whole body spasmed. “I don’t know what I’m going to do, but it will not be rational.”  He reached up from the floor and punched the stained red upholstery of the sofa as the siren-wail of his despondency grew louder, filling the room with the sound of a grown male who has lost every characteristic that separates man from infant from animal. He wore a gold silk robe that was several sizes too small, exposing his scabbed knees. The ends of the sash just barely met to form a knot and the curtains of the robe hung half a foot apart, revealing a pale, hairless chest and, below it, saggy gray Calvin Klein boxer shorts. The only other item of clothing on his trembling body was a winter cap pulled tight over his skull.</em></p>

<p><em>MEET STYLE I am far from attractive. My nose is too large for my face and, while not hooked, has a bump in the ridge. Though I am not bald, to say that my hair is thinning would be an understatement. There are just wispy Rogaineenhanced growths covering the top of my head like tumbleweeds. In my opinion, my eyes are small and beady, though they do have a lively glimmer, which is doomed to remain my secret because no one can see it behind my glasses. I have indentations on either side of my forehead, which I like and believe add character to my face, though I’ve never actually been complimented on them. I am shorter than I’d like to be and so skinny that I look malnourished to most people, no matter how much I eat. When I look down at my pale, slouched body, I wonder why any woman would want to sleep next to it, let alone embrace it. So, for me, meeting girls takes work. I’m not the kind of guy women giggle over at a bar or want to take home when they’re feeling drunk and crazy. I can’t offer them a piece of my fame and bragging rights like a rock star or cocaine and a mansion like so many other men in Los Angeles. All I have is my mind, and nobody can see that. You may notice that I haven’t mentioned my personality. This is because my personality has completely changed. Or, to put it more accurately, I completely changed my personality. I invented Style, my alter ego. And in the course of two years, Style became more popular than I ever wasespecially with women.</em></p>

<p><em>When I look back on my teenage years, I have one major regret, and it has nothing to do with not studying hard enough, not being nice to my mother, or crashing my father’s car into a public bus. It is simply that I didn’t fool around with enough girls. I am a deep man-I reread James Joyce’s Ulysses every three years for fun. I consider myself reasonably intuitive. I am at the core a good person, and I try to avoid hurting others. But I can’t seem to evolve to the next state of being because I spend far too much time thinking about women. And I know I’m not alone. When I first met Hugh Hefner, he was seventy-three. He had slept with over a thousand of the most beautiful women in the world, by his own account, but all he wanted to talk about were his three girlfriends-Mandy, Brandy, and Sandy. And how, thanks to Viagra, he could keep them all satisfied (though his money probably satisfied them enough). If he ever wanted to sleep with somebody else, he said, the rule was that they’d all do it together. So what I gathered from the conversation was that here was a guy who’s had all the sex he wanted his whole life and, at seventy-three, he’s still chasing tail. When does it stop? If Hugh Hefner isn’t over it yet, when am I going to be?</em></p>

<p><em>When she walked past again, he asked her, “Do you know Neil?” It was a stupid icebreaker, but it didn’t matter now that the ice was broken. I stammered out a few words, until Dustin took over and rescued me. We met her and her boyfriend at a bar afterward. They had just moved in together. Her boyfriend was taking their dog for a walk. After a few drinks, he took the dog home, leaving the girl, Paula, with us. Dustin suggested going back to my place to cook a late-night snack, so we walked to my tiny East Village apartment and, instead, collapsed on the bed, with Dustin on one side of Paula and me on the other. When Dustin started kissing her left cheek, he signaled me to do the same on her right cheek. Then, in synchronicity, we moved down her body to her neck and her breasts. Though I was surprised by Paula’s quiet compliance, for Dustin this seemed to be business as usual. He turned to me and asked if I had a condom. I found one for him. He pulled off her pants and moved into her while I continued lapping uselessly at her right breast. That was Dustin’s gift, his power: giving women the fantasy they never thought they’d experience. Afterward, Paula called me constantly. She wanted to talk about the experience all the time, to rationalize it, because she couldn’t believe what she had done. That’s how it always worked with Dustin: He got the girl; I got the guilt. I chalked this up to a simple difference of personality. Dustin had a natural charm and animal instinct that I just didn’t. Or at least that’s what I thought, until I read the layguide and explored the newsgroups and websites it recommended. What I discovered was an entire community filled with Dustins-men who claimed to have found the combination to unlock a woman’s heart and legs-along with thousands of others like myself, trying to learn their secrets. The difference was that these men had broken down their methods to a specific set of rules that anybody could apply. And each self-proclaimed pickup artist had his own set of rules.</em></p>

<p><em>His name, or at least the name he used online, was Mystery. He was the most worshipped pickup artist in the community, a powerhouse who spit out long, detailed posts that read like algorithms of how to manipulate social situations to meet and attract women. His nights out seducing models and strippers in his hometown of Toronto were chronicled in intimate detail online, the writing filled with jargon of his own invention: sniper negs, shotgun negs, group theory, indicators of interest, pawning all of which had become an integral part of the pickup artist lexicon. For four years, he had been offering free advice in seduction newsgroups. Then, in October, he decided to put a price on himself and posted the following: Mystery is now producing Basic Training workshops in several cities around the world, due to numerous requests. The first workshop will be in Los Angeles from Wednesday evening, October 10, through Saturday night. The fee is $500 (U.S.). This includes club entry, limo for four evenings (sweet huh?), an hour lecture in the limo each evening with a thirty-minute debriefing at the end of the night, and finally three-and-a-half hours per night in the field (broken up into two clubs per night) with Mystery. By the end of Basic Training, you will have approached close to fifty women.</em></p>

<p><em>As we waited for the other students, Mystery threw a manila envelope full of photographs in my lap. “These are some of the women I’ve dated,” he said. In the folder was a spectacular array of beautiful women: a headshot of a sultry Japanese actress; an autographed publicity still of a brunette who bore an uncanny resemblance to Liv Tyler; a glossy picture of’a Penthouse Pet of the Year; a snapshot of a tan, curvy stripper manegligee who Mystery said was his girlfriend, Patricia; and a photo of a brunette with large silicone breasts, which were being suckled by Mystery in the middle of a nightclub. These were his credentials. “I was able to do that by not paying attention to her breasts all night,” he explained when I asked about the last shot. “A pickup artist must be the exception to the rule. You must not do what everyone else does. Ever.” I listened carefully. I wanted to make sure every word etched itself on my cerebral cortex. I was attending a significant event; the only other credible pickup artist teaching courses was Ross Jeffries, who had basically founded the community in the late 1980s. But today marked the first time seduction students would be removed from the safe environs of the seminar room and let loose in clubs to be critiqued as they ran game on unsuspecting women. A second student arrived, introducing himself as Extramask. He was a tall, gangly, impish twenty-six-year-old with a bowl cut, overly baggy clothing, and a handsomely chiseled face. With the right haircut and outfit, he would easily have been a good-looking guy. When Sin asked him what his count was, Extramask scratched his head uncomfortably. “I have virtually zero experience with girls,” he explained. “I’ve never kissed a girl before.” “You’re kidding,” Sin said. “I’ve never even held a girl’s hand. I grew up pretty sheltered. My parents were really strict Catholics, so I always had a lot of guilt about girls. But I’ve had three girlfriends.”</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>The next arrival was a tanned, balding man in his forties who’d flown in from Australia just to attend the workshop. He had a ten-thousand-dollar Rolex, a charming accent, and one of the ugliest sweaters I’d ever seen-a thick cable-knit monstrosity with multi-colored zigzags that looked like the aftermath of a finger-painting mishap. He reeked of money and confidence. Yet the moment he opened his mouth to give Sin his score (five), he betrayed himself. His voice trembled; he couldn’t look anyone in the eye; and there was something pathetic and childlike about him. His appearance, like his sweater, was just an accident that spoke nothing of his nature. He was new to the community and reluctant to share even his first name, so Mystery christened him Sweater. The three of us were the only students in the workshop. “Okay, we’ve got a lot to talk about,” Mystery said, clapping his hands together. He leaned in close, so the other guests in the hotel couldn’t hear.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 18 (location ~ 267-275)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“My job here is to get you into the game,” he continued, making piercing eye contact with each of us. “I need to get what’s in my head into yours. Think of tonight as a video game. It is not real. Every time you do an approach, you are playing this game.” My heart began pounding violently. The thought of trying to start a conversation with a woman I didn’t know petrified me, especially with these guys watching and judging me. Bungee jumping and parachuting were a Cakewalk compared to this. “All your emotions are going to try to fuck you up,” Mystery continued. “They are there to try to confuse you, so know right now that they cannot be trusted at all. You will feel shy sometimes, and self-conscious, and you must deal with it like you deal with a pebble in your shoe. It’s uncomfortable, but you ignore it. It’s not part of the equation.” I looked around; Extramask and Sweater seemed just as nervous as I was. “I need to teach you, in four days, the whole equation-the sequence of moves you need to win,” Mystery went on. “And you will have to play the game over and over to learn how to win. So get ready to fail.” Mystery paused to order a Sprite with five slices of lemon on the side, then told us his story. He spoke in a loud, clear voice-modeled, he said, on the motivational speaker Anthony Robbins. Everything about him seemed to be a conscious, rehearsed invention.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>He took a half hour bus ride into Toronto every day, going to bars, clothing stores, restaurants, and coffee shops. He wasn’t aware of the online community or any other pickup artists, so he was forced to work alene, relying on the one skill he did know: magic. It took him dozens of trips to the city before he even worked up the guts to talk to a stranger. From there, he tolerated failure, rejection, and embarrassment day and night until, piece by piece, he put together the puzzle that is social dynamics and discovered what he believed to be the patterns underlying all male-female relationships. “It took me ten years to discover this,” he said. “The basic format is FMAC-find, meet, attract, close. Believe it or not, the game is linear. A lot of people don’t know that.” For the next half hour, Mystery told us about what he called group theory. “I have done this specific set of events a bazillion times,” he said. “You do not walk up to a girl who’s all by herself. That is not the perfect seduction. Women of beauty are rarely found alone.” After approaching the group, he continued, the key is to ignore the woman you desire while winning over her friends-especially the men and anyone else likely to cockblock. If the target is attractive and used to men fawning all over her, the pickup artist must intrigue her by pretending to be unaffected by her charm. This is accomplished through the use of what he called a neg. Neither compliment nor insult, a neg is something in between-an accidental insult or backhanded compliment. The purpose of a neg is to lower a woman’s self esteem while actively displaying a lack of interest in her-by telling her she has lipstick on her teeth, for example, or offering her a piece of gum after she speaks.</em></p>

<p><em>Besides confidence and a smile, we learned, the other characteristics of an alpha male were being well-groomed, possessing a sense of humor, connecting with people, and being seen as the social center of a room. No one bothered to tell Mystery that those were actually six characteristics. As Mystery dissected the alpha male further, I realized something: The reason I was here-the reason Sweater and Extramask were also here-was that our parents and our friends had failed us. They had never given us the tools we needed to become fully effective social beings. Now, decades later, it was time to acquire them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 21 (location ~ 318-323)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Well, look at you,” Mystery said. “You look average. People think if they look generic, then they can seduce a wide array of women. Not true. You have to specialize. If you look average, you’re going to get average girls. Your khaki pants are for the office. They’re not for clubs. And your sweater-burn it. You need to be bigger than life. I’m talking over the top. If you want to get the 10s, you need to learn peacock theory.” Mystery loved theories. Peacock theory is the idea that in order to attract the most desirable female of the species, it’s necessary to stand out in a flashy and colorful way. For humans, he told us, the equivalent of the fanned peacock tail is a shiny shirt, a garish hat, and jewelry that lights up in the dark-basically, everything I’d dismissed my whole life as cheesy. When it came time for my personal critique, Mystery had a laundry list of fixes: get rid of the glasses, shape the overgrown goatee, shave the expensively trimmed tumbleweeds on my head, dress more outrageously, wear a conversation piece, get some jewelry, get a life. I wrote down every word of advice. This was a guy who thought about seduction nonstop, like a mad scientist working on a formula to turn peanuts into gasoline. The archive of his Internet messages was 3,000 posts long-more than 2,500 pages-all dedicated to cracking the code that is woman.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 22 (location ~ 327-338)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I was ready to leave. But then I saw Mystery approach the people in the corner. They were sitting on opposite couches across a glass table. The men were on one side. One of them was Scott Baio, the actor best known for playing Chachi on Happy Days. Across from him were two women, a brunette and a bleached blonde who looked like she’d stepped out of the pages of Maxim. Her cut-off white T-shirt was suspended so high into the air by fake breasts that the bottom of it just hovered, flapping in the air above a belly tightened by fastidious exercise. This woman was Baio’s date. She was also, I gathered, Mystery’s target. His intentions were clear because he wasn’t talking to her. Instead, he had his back turned to her and was showing something to Scott Baio and his friend, a well-dressed, well-tanned thirty-something who looked as if he smelled strongly of aftershave. I moved in closer. “Be careful with that,” Baio was saying. “It cost forty-thousand dollars.” Mystery had Baio’s watch in his hands. He placed it carefully on the table. “Now watch this,” he commanded. “I tense my stomach muscles, increasing the flow of oxygen to my brain, and…” As Mystery waved his hands over the watch, the second hand stopped ticking. He waited fifteen seconds, then waved his hands again, and slowly the watch sputtered back to life-along with Baio’s heart. Mystery’s audience of four burst into applause.</em></p>

<p><em>With each accurate sentence Mystery spoke, the blonde’s jaw dropped further open, until she started</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 374-375)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ten long minutes later, Mystery stood up, put his arm around me, and we left the club. Outside, he pulled a cocktail napkin from his jacket pocket. It contained her phone number. “Did you get a good look at her?” Mystery asked. “That is what I’m in the game for. Everything I’ve learned I used tonight. It’s all led up to this moment. And it worked.” He beamed with selfsatisfaction. “How’s that for a demonstration?” That was all it took. Stealing a girl right from under a celebrity’s n o’s e - has-been or not-was a feat even Dustin couldn’t have accomplished. Mystery was the real deal. As we took the limo to the Key Club, Mystery told us the first command26 ment of pickup: the three-second rule. A man has three seconds after spotting a woman to speak to her, he said. If he takes any longer, then not only is the girl likely to think he’s a creep who’s been staring at her for too long, but he will start overthinking the approach, get nervous, and probably blow it. The moment we walked into the Key Club, Mystery put the threesecond rule into action. Striding up to a group of women, he held out his hands and asked, “What’s your first impression of these? Not the big hands, the black nails.” As the girls gathered around him, Sin pulled me aside and suggested wandering the club and attempting my first approach. A group of women walked by and I tried to say something. But the word “hi” just barely squeaked out of my throat, not even loud enough for them to hear. As they continued past, I followed and grabbed one of the girls on the shoulder from behind. She turned around, startled, and gave me the withering whata-creep look that was the whole reason I was too scared to talk to women in the first place.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 383-396)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Oh my God,” I said to her. “Did you see those two girls fighting outside?” “No,” she said. “What happened?” She was interested. She was talking to me. It was working. “Um, two girls were fighting over this little guy who was half their size. It was pretty brutal. He was just standing there laughing as the police came and arrested the girls.” She giggled. We started talking about the club and the band playing there. She was very friendly and actually seemed grateful for the conversation. I had no idea that approaching a woman could be this easy. Sin sidled up to me and whispered in my ear, “Go kino.” “What’s kino?” I asked. “Kino?” the girl replied. Sin reached behind me, picked up my arm, and placed it on her shoulder. “Kino is when you touch a girl,” he whispered. I felt the heat of her body and was reminded of how much I love human contact. Pets like to be petted. It isn’t sexual when a dog or a cat begs for physical affection. People are the same way: We need touch. But we’re so sexually screwed up and obsessed that we get nervous and uncomfortable whenever another person touches us. And, unfortunately, I am no exception. As I spoke to her, my hand felt wrong on her shoulder. It was just resting there like some disembodied limb, and I imagined her wondering what exactly it was doing there and how she could gracefully extricate herself from under it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 27 (location ~ 402-414)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I was in high spirits in the limo to the next bar. “Do you think I could have kissed her?” I asked Mystery. “If you think you could have, then you could have,” he said. “As soon as you ask yourself whether you should or shouldn’t, that means you should. And what you do is, you phase-shift. Imagine a giant gear thudding down in your head, and then go for it. Start hitting on her. Tell her you just noticed she has beautiful skin, and start massaging her shoulders.” “But how do you know it’s okay?” “What I do is, I look for IOIs. An IOI is an indicator of interest. If she asks you what your name is, that’s an IOI. If she asks you if you’re single, that’s an IOI. If you take her hands and squeeze them, and she squeezes back, that’s an IOI. And as soon as I get three IOIs, I phase-shift. I don’t even think about it. It’s like a computer program.” “But how do you kiss her?” Sweater asked. “I just say, ”Would you like to kiss me?“” “And then what happens?” “One of three things,” Mystery said. “If she says, ”Yes,“ which is very rare, you kiss her. If she says, ”Maybe,“ or hesitates, then you say, ”Let’s find out,“ and kiss her. And if she says, ”No,“ you say, ”I didn’t say you could. It just looked like you had something on your mind.“”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 29 (location ~ 441-453)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Have I ever told you about cat string theory?” “No.” “Listen. Have you ever seen a cat play with a string? Well, when the string is dangling above its head, just out of reach, the cat goes crazy trying to get it. It leaps in the air, dances around, and chases it all over the room. But as soon as you let go of the string and it drops right between the cat’s paws, it just looks at the string for a second and then walks away. It’s bored. It doesn’t want it anymore.” “S o… ” “So that girl moved away from you when you put your arm around her. And you ran right back to her like a puppy dog. You should have punished her-turned away and talked to someone else. Let her work to get your attention back. After that, she made you wait while she talked to that dork.” “What should I have done?” “You should have said, Til let you two be alone,” and started to walk away, as if you were giving her to him-even though you knew she liked you more. You have to act like you are the prize.“ I smiled. I think I really understood. ”Yeah,“ he said. ”Be the dancing string.“ I grew silent and thought about it, kicking my legs up against the bar counter of the limousine and slouching into the seat. Mystery turned to Sin, and they talked amongst themselves for several minutes. It felt like they were discussing me.</em></p>

<p><em>So, ever since I’d first started harboring lustful thoughts in sixth grade, I’d assumed that sex was something that just happened to guys if they went out a lot and exposed themselves to chance-after all, that’s why they called it getting lucky. The only tool they had in their belt was persistence. Of course, there were some men who were sexually comfortable around women, who would tease them mercilessly until they had them eating out of their hands. But that wasn’t me. It took all of my courage to simply ask a woman for the time or where Melrose Avenue was. I didn’t know anything about anchoring, eliciting values, finding trance words, or these other things Grimble kept talking about. How did I ever get laid without all this technology? It was a quiet Tuesday night in the Valley, and the only place Grimble knew to go was the local T.G.I. Friday’s. In the car, we warmed up-listening to cassette tapes of sarges by Rick H., practicing openers, faking smiles, and dancing in our seats to get energetic. It was one of the most ridiculous things I’d ever done, but I was entering a new world now, with its own rules of behavior. We walked in the door of the restaurant-confident, smiling, alpha. Unfortunately, no one noticed. There were two guys at the bar watching a baseball game on television, a group of businesspeople at a corner table, and a mostly male bar staff. We strutted to the balcony. As we pushed the door open, a woman appeared. Time to put what I’d learned to the test. “Hey,” I said to her. “Let me get your opinion on something.” She stopped and listened. She was about four foot ten, with short, frizzy hair and a marshmallow body, but she had a nice smile; she would be good practice. I decided to use the Maury Povich opener. “My friend Grimble there just got a call today from the Maury Povich show,” I began. “And it seems they’re doing a segment on secret admirers. Evidently, someone has a little crush on him. Do you think he should go on the show or not?”</em></p>

<p><em>“Go disarm the guy,” Grimble turned to me and hissed, “while I work on the girl.” I had no idea how to disarm him. He didn’t seem quite as laid-back as Scott Baio. “He can show you the exercise, too,” I said wanly. “It’s really cool.” “I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about,” the guy said. “What is this thing supposed to do to me?” He took a step closer and leaned his face into mine. He smelled like whiskey and onion rings. “It tells you whether… whether…” I stammered. “Never mind.” The guy lifted his hands and pushed me backward. Though I tell girls I’m five feet and eight inches, I’m actually five foot six. The top of my head just reached his shoulders. “Stop it,” his wife, our former sarge, said. She turned to us. “He’s drunk. He gets like this.” “Like what?” I asked. “Violent?” She smiled sadly. “You seem like a great couple,” I said. My attempt to disarm him had clearly failed, because he was about to disarm me. His red drunken face was two inches from mine and yelling about ripping something. “Pleasure meeting you both,” I squeaked, slowly backing away. “Remind me,” Grimble said as we retreated to the car, “to teach you how to handle the AMOG.” “The AMOG?” “Yes, the alpha male of the group.” Oh, I see.</em></p>

<p><em>“Case closed,” he said. He was good. A short waitress with blue nails, a touch of baby fat, and sandy brown hair arrived to take our order. Ross looked at her, and then winked at me. “These are my students,” he told her. “I’m their guru.” “Really?” she asked, feigning interest. “What would you say if I told you that I teach people how to use mind control to attract any person they desire?” “Get out of here.” “Yes, it’s true. I could make you fall in love with any person at this table.” “And how’s that? With mind control?” She was skeptical, but bordering on curious. “Let me ask you something. When you’re really attracted to somebody, how do you know? In other words, what signals do you get from yourself, inside, that allow you to realize”-and here he lowered his voice, slowly pronouncing each word-“you’re… really… attracted… to… this guy?” The purpose of the question, I would find out later, was to make the waitress feel the emotion of attraction in his presence, and thus associate those feelings with his face.</em></p>

<p><em>”I want to be loved by two women,“ he said. ”I want a blonde 10 and an Asian 10, who will love each other as much as they love me. And Patricia’s heterosexuality is affecting my sex life with her, because unless I imagine another girl there, I can’t always keep my boner.“ He moved the phone to another room because his sister and her husband were arguing, and continued, ”I’d just break up with Patricia, but there aren’t any 10s in Toronto. No outrageous glitter girls. It’s all 7s, at best.“ ”Move to L.A.,“ I urged. ”This is where all the peacocky girls you like live. “ ”Yeah, I really need to get out of here,“ he sighed. ”So I want to schedule a bunch of workshops. I’ve got people interested in Miami, Chicago, and New York. “ ”How about Belgrade? “ ”What? Isn’t there a war going on there?“ ”No, the war’s over. And I have to visit an old friend. He said it’s safe. We can stay with him for free, and Slavic women are supposed to be the most beautiful in the world.“ He hesitated. ”And I have a free companion ticket.“ Silence. He was considering it. I pushed further. ”What the hell. It’s an adventure. At the very worst, you’ll have a new picture for your photo routine.“ Mystery thought like a flowchart. And if he agreed to something, his assent was given instantly and always with the same word, which he spoke next: ”Done.“</em></p>

<p><em>”If you’re going to be my wing, you can’t be Neil Strauss,“ he said with the same air of finality with which he had spoken the word done. ”It’s time for you to change, to just snap and become someone else. Think about it: Neil Strauss, writer. That isn’t cool. Nobody wants to sleep with a writer. They’re at the bottom of the social ladder. You must be a superstar. And not just with women. You are an artist in need of an art. And I think your art is actually the social skills you’re learning. I watched you in the field; you adapted quickly. That’s why Sin and I picked you. Hold on a minute.“ I heard him rustling through some papers. ”Listen,“ he said. ”These are my personal development goals. I want to raise the money for a touring illusion show. I want to live in posh hotels. I want a limo to and from shows. I want specials on TV with big illusions. I want to levitate over Niagara Falls. I want to travel to England and Australia. I want jewelry, games, a model airplane, a personal assistant, a stylist. And I want to act in Jesus Christ Superstar-as Jesus.“ At least he knew what he wanted in life. ”What I’m really after,“ he finally said, ”is for people to be envious of me, for women to want me and men to want to be me.“ ”You never got much love as a child, did you?“ ”No,“ he replied sheepishly. At the end of the conversation, he said he was going to e-mail me the password to a secret online community called Mystery’s Lounge. He had created Mystery’s Lounge two years before, after an enterprising bartender he’d slept with in Los Angeles found an Internet post he’d written about her on a public seduction newsgroup. After spending a weekend poring through the rest of his online archive, she e-mailed Mystery’s girlfriend, Patricia, and told her about her boyfriend’s extracurricular activities. The fallout nearly destroyed his relationship, and in the process taught him that there was a downside to being a pickup artist: getting caught.</em></p>

<p><em>I watched the videos Grimble had given me and took notes on each, memorizing affirmations (“if a woman enters my world, it will be the best thing that can ever happen to her”) and patterns. There is a difference between a line and a pattern. A line is basically any prepared comment made to a woman. A pattern is a more elaborate script, specifically designed to arouse her. Men and women think and respond differently. Show a man the cover of Playboy, and he’s ready to go. In fact, show him a pitted avocado and he’s ready to go. Women, according to the speed seducers, aren’t persuaded as easily by direct images and talk. They respond better to metaphor and suggestion. One of Ross Jeffries’s most famous patterns uses a Discovery Channel show about roller coaster design as a metaphor for the attraction, trust, and excitement that are often necessary preconditions for sex. The pattern describes the “perfect attraction,” which provides a feeling of excitement as the roller coaster rises to a summit and then whooshes down in a rush; then it offers a feeling of safety, because it was designed to allow you to have this experience in a comfortable, safe environment; finally, as soon as the ride is over, you want to climb back on and ride it again and again. Even if it seems unlikely that a pattern like this will turn a girl on, at least it’s better than talking about work. It wasn’t enough, though, for me just to study Ross Jeffries. A lot of his ideas are simply applications of neuro-linguistic programming. So I went to the source and bought books by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, the University of California professors who developed and popularized this fringe school of hypnopsychology in the 1970s.</em></p>

<p><em>To further demonstrate value, I bought books on handwriting analysis, rune reading, and tarot cards. After all, everyone’s favorite subject is themselves. I took notes on everything I studied, developing routines and stories to test in the field. I neglected my work, my friends, and my family. I was on an eighteen-hour-a-day mission. When I finally crammed as much information in my brain as it could hold, I started working on body language. I signed up for lessons in swing and salsa dancing. I rented Rebel Without A Cause and A Streetcar Named Desire to practice the looks and poses of James Dean and Marlon Brando. I studied Pierce Brosnan in the remake of The Thomas Crown Affair, Brad Pitt in Meet Joe Black, Mickey Rourke in Wild Orchid, Jack Nicholson in The Witches of Eastwick, and Tom Cruise in Top Gun. I looked at every aspect of my physical behavior. Were my arms swinging when I walked? Did they bow out a little, as if trying to get around massive pectorals? Did I walk with a confident swagger? Could I stick my chest out further? Hold my head up higher? Swing my legs out further, as if trying to get around massive genitalia? After correcting what I could on my own, I signed up for a course on Alexander Technique to improve my posture and rid myself of the round-shouldered curse I’d inherited from my father’s side of the family. And because no one ever understands a word I say-my voice is too fast, quiet, and mumbly-I started taking weekly private lessons in speech and singing. I wore stylish jackets with bright shirts and accessorized as much as I could. I bought rings, a necklace, and fake piercings. I experimented with cowboy hats, feather boas, light-up necklaces, and even sunglasses at night to see which received the most attention from women. In my heart, I knew most of these gaudy accouterments were tacky, but Mystery’s peacock theory worked. When I wore at least one item that stood out, women who were interested in meeting me had an easy way to start a conversation.</em></p>

<p><em>Everyone in Office Depot was staring at us. I couldn’t go on. “I’m late for an appointment,” I told her. My hands were shaking from nerves. “But what steps can we take to continue this conversation?” This was Mystery’s number-close routine. A pickup artist never gives a girl his phone number, because she might not call. A PUA must make a woman comfortable enough to give him her number. He must also avoid asking for it directly, because she could always say no, and instead lead her to suggest the idea herself. “I could give you my number,” she offered. She wrote down her name, followed by her number and e-mail address. I couldn’t believe it. “I don’t go out much, though,” she warned, as an afterthought. Maybe she was already having regrets. When I returned home, I pulled the scrap of paper out of my pocket and placed it in front of the computer. Since she was supposedly a model, I wanted to look for a picture of her online. She had only given me her first name, Dalene, but fortunately her e-mail address contained her last name, Kurtis. I typed the words into Google, and nearly a hundred thousand results came up. I had just number-closed the reigning Playmate of the Year. CHAPTER 3 I sat in front of my phone and stared at Dalene Kurtis’s number every evening.</em></p>

<p><em>“I’ve been taking a course in handwriting analysis,” I told her. “While we’re waiting for our food, do you mind if I practice on you?” She looked at me skeptically but then decided I was harmless and consented. I handed her my notebook and told her to write a sentence in it. “Interesting,” I said. “Your handwriting has no slant. It’s straight up and down, which means you’re a self-sufficient person and don’t always need to be around others to feel good about yourself.” I made sure she was nodding in agreement, and then continued. This was a technique I had learned from a book on cold-reading that exposed the truisms and body-language-reading techniques that sham psychics use. “You don’t have a great organizational system to your writing, which means that in general you’re not good at keeping yourself organized and sticking to a schedule.” With each tidbit I told her, she leaned in closer and nodded her head more vigorously. She had a wonderful smile and was easy to talk to. She’d just finished a comedy class nearby, she said, and offered to read me some jokes from her notebook. “I open my shows with this one,” she said after my analysis. “I just got back from the gym, and boy are my arms tired.” This was her opener. She had it on a cheat sheet that she kept in her back pocket. Picking up women, I realized, was a lot like stand-up comedy or any other performing art. They each require openers, routines, and a memorable close, plus the ability to make it all seem new every time. She said she was spending the night at a hotel in town, so I offered to drive her there. As I dropped her off, I pointed to my cheek and said, “Kiss goodbye.” She kissed my cheek.</em></p>

<p><em>To be honest, I had no idea whether this was turning her on or not. She was listening, and she seemed to be enjoying it, but she didn’t start sucking my fingers like the girl in Grimble’s story. In fact, I felt not only a little stupid but also lecherous using the pretext of hypnosis to touch her. I didn’t like these forbidden patterns. I got into the game to learn confidence, not mind control. I stopped and asked her what she thought. “It felt good,” she said, and smiled her ferret smile. I couldn’t tell whether she was humoring me or not, but I suppose most people are willing to try something new if it seems safe. I folded the piece of paper, put it in my pocket, and drove her back to her hotel. But instead of dropping her off, I pulled into the garage. We climbed out of the car, and I followed her to her room. I was too scared to say a word, afraid she might suddenly turn on me and ask, “Why are you following me?” But she seemed to have mentally consented: It looked like we were going to have sex tonight. I couldn’t believe my luck. After all that practice, I was finally getting results. According to Mystery, it takes roughly seven hours for a woman to be comfortably led from meet to sex. These seven hours can take place all in one night, or over several days: approaching and talking for an hour; speaking on the phone for an hour; meeting for drinks for two hours; talking on the phone for another hour; and then, on the next meeting, hanging out for two more hours before going to bed together. Waiting seven hours or more is what Mystery calls solid game. But occasionally a woman either goes out with the specific intention of taking someone home, or can be easily led to sex in a shorter amount of time. Mystery calls this fool’s mate. I had spent an hour with this girl at La Salsa and two hours at the bar. I was about to experience my first fool’s mate. She put the card key in the lock of her room and the green light appeared-an omen, I felt, of the night of passion to come. She opened the door, and I followed her inside. She sat on the foot of the bed-just like in the movies-and pulled her shoes off. First the left, then the right. She was wearing white socks, which I found rather endearing. She flexed the toes of both feet upward, then curled them downward as she collapsed backward on the bed. I took a step toward her, prepared to fall on her in an embrace. But suddenly the foulest smell I have ever encountered assailed my nostrils. It literally pushed me backward. It was the exact rancid-cheese smell that homeless alcoholics on New York subways have. The kind that clears the whole subway car. No matter how many steps back I took, the intensity of the smell did not diminish. It filled the entire room, every available space.</em></p>

<p><em>I bet you fuckers didn’t think I’d be writing this much detail, did you? So I was kissing her and rubbing her poon down. This was pretty hard. I couldn’t concentrate on kissing her and rubbing her at the same time. I was doing my best though. She started rubbing my cock, and it felt pretty cool. LOL. WIDEFACE: Fuck me Extramask. EXTRAMASK: Okay. So I tore off my fucking underwear. I kneeled there on her bed with my rock-hard boner pulsating, throbbing-you know it. WIDEFACE: Put on a condom. I have one. EXTRAMASK: I have one of my own. I didn’t want to use hers. I was freaked out about it for some reason, like she would sabotage it or some shit. WIDEFACE: What brand? EXTRAMASK: Sheik. Again, I was a virgin at this point and I didn’t know how to properly put a condom on. EXTRAMASK: Put the condom on, it turns me on. WIDEFACE: Okay. She couldn’t get the condom on, so she went to get hers. As she went and got hers, I ended up getting my own on. Then I fucked her! I fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her and fucked her. About fifteen minutes into the whole thing, I was thinking, “This fucking sucks. This is fucking sex? I hate this. I want to leave.” I legitimately wanted to leave. I was thinking, “I busted my fucking balls for months for this?” I was sitting there pumping this girl missionary style for fifteen minutes getting no feeling. She was all moaning and shit, and I’m just pumping away like a tool. So I decided to move her around and try some positions-just like in the porno movies! I had her on top. I had always fantasized about this. So she was on top of me and I was thinking, “Holy shit, this fucking hurts. My cock is gonna fucking snap off.” After about two minutes, I changed positions because it hurt so much. I got her into doggy-style position. I thought this would be interesting. So I had her from behind and I was trying to find the slot, but I couldn’t . I was sitting there fishing around her ass and upper legs looking for the entry. It was horrible, just like the sex. I couldn’t find the hole. She started to whine because of the long delay. I was thinking, “You’re whining? Calm it down, China-seriously.” I wasn’t getting any arousal out of this deal. I got it in for two strokes, then it popped out. Then she started whining again. So I switched positions and, for some reason, I went to the her-on-top position again. Dumb move, Extramask. I feared my cock would break right the fuck off. After about four minutes of that, we went back to missionary,</em></p>

<p><em>This was a mistake on my part. After sex I should have ripped my condom off, sat on her bed, and jerked off until completion. I should have wacked my load all over the place, her face, and her Trinitron TV set. WIDEFACE: Lie down and rest for five minutes. Then I will call a cab. EXTRAMASK: What? Five minutes? Why are you trying to rush me out of here? WIDEFACE: No, I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just good to rest after sex for five minutes. EXTRAMASK: What’s with the five minutes thing? WIDEFACE: No. Just relax. EXTRAMASK: But why five minutes? Five minutes later she called a cab. She was on hold with the cab company, and she started getting all frustrated because she had to wait, which was annoying. So I got ready to leave. I chatted with her a bit more. She said she noticed in the club that I had lots of energy. She liked it. WIDEFACE: What are you going to do now? [It was 3:30 A.M.) EXTRAMASK: I’m going to another club to hook up with my friends. [I got even more energetic. I jumped around.) She totally didn’t like that I said I was going out again. And I really wasn’t. I just lied to her. I did it because I was pissed that she was trying to get rid of me so quickly. Overall, I wanted to leave her place immediately-I just wanted to leave on my terms. So the cab arrived and I left her place. We kissed about three times before my exit. I didn’t get her number because: 1. I didn’t want to fuck her again. 2. It was obvious this was a one-night stand. Just to be on the safe side, I made sure I wrote down her exact address when I left-just in case I forgot shit there. I would rather have it than not have it.</em></p>

<p><em>I had read in a book called Introducing NLP that there is no such thing as failure, only learning lessons. I wanted the learning lessons to take place in my head, so that in the field I was flawless. I would have to prove myself to Mystery’s students, just as Sin had proven himself to me. And one public failure would discredit everything. The students would post reviews saying that Style was an imposter, a joke. But there was still one problem I couldn’t work through. Though an opener, a neg, and a demonstration of higher value were enough to get anyone’s phone number, I had no idea what to do next. No one had taught me. I mean, I technically knew the words of the Mystery kiss-close: “Would you like to kiss me?” But I was too petrified to actually speak them. After spending so much time bonding with a girl (whether for a half hour in a club or several hours at our next meeting), I was too scared to break the rapport and trust I had built. Unless she gave me a clear indication that she was sexually interested in me, I felt like trying to kiss her would disappoint her and she’d think I was just like all the other guys.</em></p>

When the barber finished, I looked in the mirror and saw a chemo patient staring back at me. ”It looks good,“ Mystery said. ”Let’s see if there’s a tanning salon around here. We’ll have you looking like a thug in no time.“ ”Okay. But I’m not getting Lasik in Serbia.“ My first thought once I was shaven-headed and tan was: What took me so long? I looked much better. I had transformed from a 5 to a 6.5 on the attractiveness scale. This trip was turning out to be a good idea.</em></p>

<p><em>Marko hadn’t dated a single woman since he’d moved to Belgrade. But a few months ago, through friend of his, he’d met a girl named Goca, and he was sure she was the one. He took her out on dates, bought her flowers, treated her to dinner, and dropped her off at home afterward, like a perfect gentleman. ”Have you slept with her yet?“ I asked him. ”No. I haven’t even kissed her.“ ”Dude, you’re behaving like a total AFC. One day a guy is going to walk up to her in a club, say, “Do you think magic spells work?” and take her home. She wants an adventure. She wants to have sex. All girls do.“ ”Well,“ Marko said, ”she’s different from all those girls. People have more class here than they do in L.A.“ The PUAs have a name for this: They call it one-itis. It’s a disease AFCs get: They become obsessed with a girl they’re neither dating nor sleeping with, and then start acting so needy and nervous around her that they end up driving her away. The cure for one-itis, PUAs like to say, is to go out and have sex withadozen other girls-and then see if this flower is still so special.</em></p>

<p><em>”Go into the two-set over there,“ I instructed him. It didn’t take any game to send guys into sets. ”Tell them you’re showing some friends from America around and want suggestions for good clubs to take them to.“ It was a crash-and-burn mission. Sasha meekly approached them from behind and tried several times to get them to notice him. Once he had their attention, it was a struggle for him to keep it. Like many guys, he didn’t communicate with energy. All those years of insecurity and social ostracism had chased his spirit and joy of life deep within his body. Whenever he opened his mouth, there was no need for anyone to strain to make out his faint mumblings. The message was clear: ”I was built to be ignored.“ ”Go in,“ Mystery said to me as he watched Sasha flounder with the Bo Derek blonde. ”What?“ ”Go in. Help him out. Show the boys how it’s done.“ Fear seizes hold in your chest first. It clamps gently to the top of the heart, like a vice made of rubber. Then you really feel it. Your stomach churns. Your throat closes. And you swallow, desperately trying to avoid the dryness and hoping that when you open your mouth, a confident, clear voice will emerge. Even after all my training, I was terrified. Women, by and large, are much more perceptive than men. They can instantly spot insincerity and bullshit. So a great pickup artist must either be congruent with his material-and really believe it-or be a great actor. Anyone talking to a woman while simultaneously worrying about what she thinks of him is going to fail. Anyone caught thinking about getting into a woman’s pants before she starts thinking about what’s in his pants is going to fail. And most men fall into this category. Sasha does. I do. We can’t help it: It’s our nature. Mystery calls it dynamic social homeostasis. We are constantly buffeted about by, on one hand, our overwhelming desire to have sex with a girl and, on the other, the need to protect ourselves when approaching. The reason this fear exists, he says, is because we are wired evolutionarily for a tribal existence, where everyone in the community knows when a man is rejected by a woman. He is then ostracized and his genes, as Mystery puts it, are unapologetically weeded out of existence. As I approached, I tried to push the fear out of my chest and rationally assess the situation. Sasha’s problem was his body position. Both women were facing the bar, and he had approached from behind. So they had to turn around to respond.</em></p>

<p><em>Sasha was still talking to the black-haired girl, so I whispered in his ear, ”Tell her we have to go, and ask for her e-mail.“ He did and, lo and behold, she gave it to him. We rejoined the group and left the cafe. Sasha was a new man. Flushed with excitement, he skipped down the street like a little boy, singing in Serbian. He was being, in his own awkward way, himself. He’d never gotten a girl’s e-mail address before. ”I’m so happy,“ Sasha raved. ”This is probably the best day of my life.“ As anyone who regularly reads newspapers or true-crime books knows, a significant percentage of violent crime, from kidnappings to shooting sprees, is the result of the frustrated sexual impulses and desires of males. By socializing guys like Sasha, Mystery and I were making the world a safer place. Mystery threw his arm around my neck and pulled my face into his wizard’s overcoat. ”You’ve done me proud,“ he said. ”It’s not just about getting the girl. It’s about the students seeing it happen and believing it can be done.“</em></p>

<p><em>It was then that I realized the downside to this whole venture. A gulf was opening between men and women in my mind. I was beginning to see women solely as measuring instruments to give me feedback on how I was progressing as a pickup artist. They were my crash-test dummies, identifiable only by hair colors and numbers-a blonde 7, a brunette 10. Even when I was having a deep conversation, learning about a woman’s dreams and point of view, in my mind I was just ticking off a box in my routine marked rapport. In bonding with men, I was developing an unhealthy attitude toward the opposite sex. And the most troubling thing about this new mindset was that it seemed to be making me more successful with women.</em></p>

<p><em>We were about to leave when Mystery spied, among the group of Serbians, a lone girl. She was young and slender with long black hair and a red dress that showed off a set of perfectly tapered legs. It was an impossible set: She was surrounded by stocky guys with crewcuts. These were men who had clearly been in the military during the war, men who had probably killed before, maybe even with their bare hands. And Mystery was going in. The pickup artist is the exception to the rule. ”Here,“ he told me. ”Clasp your hands together. And when I say so, act as if you can’t open them.“ He pretended, through the art of illusion, to seal my hands together. I pretended to be amazed. The commotion attracted the attention of the bouncers in the club, who asked him to try the feat with their hammy fists. Instead, Mystery performed his watch-stopping illusion for them. Soon, the club manager was giving him free drinks and the table of Serbians had halted their conversation and were gawking at him, including his target. ”If you can make a girl envy you,“ Mystery told the students, ”you can make a girl sleep with you.“ Two principles were at work. First, he was generating social proof by earning the attention and approval of the club staff. And, second, he was pawning-in other words, he was using one group to work his way into another, less approachable group nearby. For his coup de grace, Mystery told the club manager he would levitate a beer bottle. He approached the table of Serbians, asked to borrow an empty bottle, and made it float in the air in front of him for a few seconds. Now he was in his target’s group. He performed a few illusions for the guys and ignored the girl for the requisite five minutes. Then he relented, started talking to her, and isolated her to a couch nearby. He had pawned the entire club just to meet her.</em></p>

<p><em>The great Style, the apprentice PUA whose magnetism was so strong that it made Marko look like an AFC to his own true love, was still too scared to kiss a girl. I had great opening game, but no follow through. I should have taken care of the problem before Belgrade. But it was too late. I was blowing it. I was scared of rejection, and of feeling uncomfortable afterward. Mystery, in the meantime, was getting along just fine with Natalija, who was thirteen years his junior. They had nothing in common, not even a language. But there they were, sitting together. His legs were crossed and he was leaning back, letting her work to get his attention. She was leaning into him, with her hand on his knee. I walked my date back to her house after coffee. Her parents weren’t even home. All I had to say was, ”Can I use the bathroom?,“ and I could have been upstairs. But my mouth wouldn’t speak the words. Countless successful approaches had helped reduce my fear of social rejection and made me seem like a promising pickup artist to others, but inside I knew I was just an approach artist. To become a PUA, there was a far-more-devastating mental obstacle I still needed to overcome: my fear of sexual rejection. In the course of my seduction research, I’d read Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. And I remembered how much work and persistence it had taken the aristocratic dandy Rodolphe Boulanger de la Huchette to get just a kiss from the unhappily married Madame Bovary. But once he persuaded her to submit the first time, it was all over. She was obsessed. One of the tragedies of modern life is that women as a whole do not hold a lot of power in society, despite all the advances made in the last century. Sexual choice, however, is one of the only areas where women are indisputably in control. It’s not until they’ve made a choice, and submitted to it, that the relationship is inverted-and the man is generally back in a posi94 tion of power over her. Perhaps that is why women, to the frustration of men everywhere, are so cautious about saying yes. In order to excel at anything, there are always hurdles, obstacles, or challenges one must get past. It’s what bodybuilders call the pain period.</em></p>

Bye.“ As he walked away, her face fell. The thought that she might never see him again seemed to flash through her mind. This is what Mystery calls a false takeaway. He wasn’t really leaving; he was just letting her think he was. Mystery took five steps-counting as he went-then turned around and said, ”I’ve been living in a shitty apartment for the past week. I’m going to get a hotel room right there and take a bath.“ He pointed to the Hotel Moskva down the street. ”You can come with me or just get an e-mail from me in two weeks when I return to Canada.“ Natalija hesitated for a moment, then followed him. And that’s when I realized the mistake I’d been making my whole life: to get a woman, you have to be willing to risk losing her. When I returned to the house, Marko was packing.</em></p>

<p><em>Mystery thrust his head over the seat partition. ”Imagine this. A poster of just my hands, with black nails, and the word Mystery at the bottom. How amazing would that be?“ For the first time, I lost it with him. ”Dude, this is not the fucking time. Open your eyes.“ ”Don’t tell me what to do,“ he snapped. ”We’re about to get thrown in jail. No one wants to hear your shit right now. Does nothing exist except for you and your fucking magic show?“ ”Listen, if you want to go at it, I’ll go at it,“ he thundered. ”I’ll take you down right now. Just step out of the fucking car, and I’ll deal with you.“ The guy was a foot taller than me, and the border crossing was full of armed soldiers. There was no way I was going to tangle with him. But I was angry enough to consider it. Mystery had been dead weight this entire trip. Maybe Marko was right: Mystery wasn’t one of us. He hadn’t gone to the Latin School of Chicago. I took a deep breath and stared straight ahead, trying to contain my rage. The guy was a narcissist. He was a flower that bloomed with attentionbe it positive or negative-and wilted when ignored. Peacock theory wasn’t just to attract girls. It existed first and foremost to attract attention. Even picking a fight with me was just another plea for attention, because I’d been ignoring him for the past hundred miles. When I glanced at the rearview mirror and saw him pouting in the back seat with his hat pulled over his eyes, however, I actually began to feel bad for him. ”I didn’t mean to snap at you,“ I told him. ”I don’t like it when someone tells me what to do. My dad used to tell me what to do. And I hate him.“ ”Well, I’m not your dad,“ I said.</em></p>

<p><em>Here’s what I did-the evolution phase-shift routine: 1. I leaned in and told her she smelled good. I asked her what perfume she was wearing, and then discussed how animals always sniff each other before they mate and how we’re evolutionarily wired to feel aroused when someone smells us. 2. Then I discussed how lions bite each other’s mane during sex, and how pulling the back of the hair is another evolutionary trigger. As I spoke, I ran my hand up the back of her neck, grabbed a fistful of hair at the roots, and pulled it firmly downward. 3. She didn’t seem upset, so I pushed further. I told her how the most sensitive parts of the body are usually hidden from contact with the air-for example, where the arm bends on the other side of the elbow. Then I took her arm, bent it a little, and erotically bit the crease on the opposite side of the elbow. She said it gave her the chills. 4. Afterward, 1 said, ”But do you know what the best thing in the world is? A bite… right… here.“ I pointed to the side of my neck. Then I said, ”Bite my neck,“ as if I expected her to do it. She refused to at first, so I turned away calmly to punish her. I waited a few seconds, then turned back and repeated, ”Bite me right here.“ This time, she did. It was cat-string theory in action.</em></p>

<p><em>In life, people tend to wait for good things to come to them. And by waiting, they miss out. Usually, what you wish for doesn’t fall in your lap; it falls somewhere nearby, and you have to recognize it, stand up, and put in the time and work it takes to get to it. This isn’t because the universe is cruel. It’s because the universe is smart. It has its own cat-string theory and knows we don’t appreciate things that fall into our laps. I would have to pick up my bucket and work. So I took Mystery’s advice. I got Lasik surgery, shedding my nerdy glasses once and for all. I paid to get my teeth laser-whitened. And I joined a gym and took up surfing, which was not only a cardiovascular workout but also a way to get tan. In some respects, surfing reminded me of sarging. Some days you go out and catch every wave and think you’re a champ; other days you don’t get one good wave and you think you suck. But no matter what, every day you go out and you learn and you improve. And that’s what keeps you coming back. However, I hadn’t joined the community just to get a makeover. I needed to complete my mental transformation, which I knew would be much more difficult. Before Belgrade, I had taught myself the words, skills, and body language of a man of charisma and quality. Now I needed to develop the confidence, self-worth, and inner game to back it up. Otherwise, I’d just be a fake, and women would sense it instantly. I had two months off until my next workshop with Mystery in Miami, and I wanted to really blow away the students there. I aimed to outdo Mystery’s sarge at Club Ra in Belgrade. So I gave myself an assignment: to meet, in the next few months, every top PUA there was. I planned to make myself a seducing machine, designed from pieces of all the best PUAs. And now that I had some status in the community as Mystery’s new wing, it would be easy to meet them.</em></p>

<p><em>“Please, goddess of seduction and patron saint of pickup artists and guys trying to get nookie everywhere, please do not let Style be weird.” Talking too fast is usually a sign of a deep lack of confidence. People who feel that others aren’t interested in what they think talk fast for fear of losing the attention of their audience. Others are so in love with perfection that they have a difficult time editing it all down and continuously speed up in hopes of getting it all in. Such people usually become writers. That was it: weirdo or writer. I hoped it was the latter. I needed a friend and equal in this world of seduction, not another student. I’d first heard of Style on the Internet. We had come to admire each other’s postings on a website dedicated to the art of seduction. He wrote with grace and eloquence. He seemed to be a positive guy who was focused on sharing. What he saw in my posts I can only guess.</em></p>

<p><em>CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP, CLICKITY CLOMP.  Style and his shoes were moving along the backside of the divider that bisected the long room. I didn’t want him to join us. It is not that I didn’t appreciate Style. He had me at a humble, “Greetings, I am the one called Style.” It was just that the vibe between her and me and the never-ending white petals was so… mesmerizing. And also because I am a wolf and this little doe separated from her herd was mine. If Style shows up, I might have to bite his face. The first thing you say to a woman matters very little. Some guys tell me they can’t think of anything or they need a really good line. I tell them they are thinking too much. You are not that important. I am not that important. We have never thought a thought so great that it needs to be wrapped with so much care. Give up your need for perfection. As far as opening lines go, a grunt or a fart is sufficient. “How are you?” I asked. That is one of my usual openers. Just something you hear every day from the grocery store clerk. Ninety-five percent respond with a one-word, noncommittal answer: “fine” or “okay.” Three percent respond with enthusiasm: “great” or “super.” Those are the ones you learn to stay away from-they’re nuts. And two percent respond with an honest, “Terrible. My husband just left me for his yoga teacher’s receptionist. How fucking Zen.” Those are the ones you love. She tells me she is “fine.” Her voice is rough for such a small package. She must have been up late screaming at the Courtney Love concert. I am not really into the loud rock scene. I like elevator music. But I forgive her. I don’t screen women. That would only limit my adventures. I only screen on how well I get treated. I look at her expectedly. She takes the hint. “How are you?” she asks. I ponder a moment. “I’m an 8.” I’m always an 8, sometimes an 8.5. There are two paths to move a conversation. You can either ask questions: “Where are you from?”; “How many ways can you curl your tongue?”; “Do you believe in reincarnation?” Or you can make statements: “I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan-home to hundreds and hundreds of ice cream shops”; “I had a girlfriend who could curl her tongue into a poodle”; “My housemate’s cat is the reincarnation of Richard Nixon.”</em></p>

<p><em>Later my research shifted toward understanding people and myself. I became a variety act-juggler, street performer, comedian. It’s the backwater of entertainment, but a great place to learn about human interaction. As a side effect, I became good with women. By my twenty-third birthday, I had slept with only one woman. By my twenty-eighth, I could sleep with as many as I wanted. My approach became subtle and efficient, my game graceful and compact. Then I found the community. Although my interest was much broader than just seduction, their dedication to understanding human interaction was like coming home. Then I met Style and felt a kinship on an entirely new level. Style listened. Most people don’t listen because they are afraid of what they might hear. Style had no preconceived notions. He was cool with however anyone wanted to be. He didn’t find bitchy girls who had to be broken. He found feisty girls who were fun to play with. He didn’t see a path of random obstacles. He saw an opportunity to explore new territory. Together we were the Lewis and Clark of seduction. When the workshop ended at 3:00 A.M., Style and I decided to share a hotel room with some of his family who were in town. We talked in hushed voices so as not to wake them. I teased Style’s fashion sense. He made fun of my midwestern sensibilities. We shared stories from our experiences with the community and counted up the loot-a couple of kisses for Style, a couple of telephone numbers for me. The mood was giddy. We felt on the edge</em></p>

You are Mystery’s first and best student, the only guy who’s sarging regularly with him. So every time Ross asks you a question like, ”Are you lying to your guru?,“ and you answer, the presupposition that he’s your guru is affirmed. Every little thing he does is to prove you are a convert and you’ve disavowed your old religion to embrace the true one that actually works. That is his message. So be careful.” There was a catch to learning NLP, manipulation, and selfimprovement. No action-whether yours or another’s-was devoid of intent. Every word had a hidden meaning, and every hidden meaning had weight, and every weight had its own special place on the scale of selfinterest. However, as much as Ross may have been nurturing a friendship with me in order to crush Mystery, he also had a reputation for befriending younger students just so they’d take him to parties.</em></p>

<p><em>“Style’s very successful,” Ross told them. “He gets a lot of chicks using my material.” Even pickup artists in their forties still seek the approval of their parents. I talked to his mother for a while about her son’s line of work. “Some people think if he talks about sex and women, it’s terrible,” his mom said. “But he’s not crude and vulgar. He’s a very bright boy.” She stood up and ambled to a wall of shelving. “I have a book of poetry he wrote when he was nine years old. Do you want to read some of it? One of them says he’s a king and he’s on a throne.” “No, you don’t want to read that,” Ross interrupted. “Jesus Christ, this was a mistake. Let’s get going.” The party was a disaster. Ross couldn’t handle himself around classy people. He spent most of the night thinking he was flirting by acting as if he were my gay lover and crawling on all fours behind Carmen Electra, pretending to be a dog sniffing her ass. When I was talking to another girl, he interrupted to brag about a pickup he had just done. At 10:00 P.M., he said he was tired and demanded that I drive him home. “Next time, we should stay later,” I said. “No, next time we have to arrive at the right time,” he scolded me. “I can stay out late, provided I get about twelve hours notice so I can take it easy and nap in the afternoon.” “You’re not that old.” I made a mental note never again to take Ross anywhere cool. It was an embarrassment. Since I’d started spending so much time with PUAs, I’d lowered my standards for people I hung out with. All my old friends had fallen by the wayside. Now my social life was monopolized by a caliber of nerd I’d never associated with before. I was in the game to have more women in my life, not men. And though the community was all about women, it was also completely devoid of them. Hopefully, this was just part of the process, the way cleaning a house often makes it messier first.</em></p>

<p><em>Rick H. was short, slightly stocky, and dressed in a large-collared shirt and a red blazer. Trailing behind him were six attraction adepts eager to soak up his wisdom. I recognized two of them: Extramask, whose eyes were swollen nearly shut, and Grimble, who was beginning to have doubts about his application of Speed Seduction. Hypnotizing women into being groped in clubs wasn’t getting him any girlfriends. So after spending time with Rick H., Grimble had turned cocky funny. His new approach was to stick his elbow out whenever a woman walked past, bump her, and then yell ”owwww“ loudly, as if she’d hurt him. When she stopped, he’d accuse her of grabbing his ass. It was much more rewarding, he realized, to be funny in a bar than creepy. Rick took a seat at the table and spread himself out comfortably. While students crammed around him, he began holding court. He had two rules for women, he said. The first: No good deed goes unpunished. (A phrase, ironically, that was coined by a woman, Clare Boothe Luce.) The second: Always have a better answer. One of the corollaries of Rick’s second rule was to never give a woman a straight answer to a question. So if a woman asks what you do for a living, keep her guessing: Tell her you’re a cigarette lighter repairman or a white slave trader or a professional hopscotch player. The first time I tried this, it didn’t go so well. In a five-set in a hotel lobby one night, a woman asked what my job was. I told her the response I had written on my cheat sheet for the night: white slave trader. As soon as the words left my mouth, I realized I probably wasn’t going to get a number-close. Everyone in the set was African-American.</em></p>

Every single thing a girl says or does to me is an IOI. Period. She wants me. It doesn’t matter who she is. And when you believe that, they start to believe it too. I am a slave to my love of women. They can sense it. The weakness of women is language and words. Fortunately, that is one of my strong points. If they try to repel my advances, I act like they are from Mars and what they are saying doesn’t make any sense. I never try to defend myself or apologize for being a womanizer. Why? Because a reputation is attractive to women. It’s true. I am the other man who guys worry about when they marry a girl.</em></p>

I had a list: to believe that I was attractive to women; to live in my own reality; to stop worrying about what other people thought of me; to move and speak with an air of strength, confidence, mystery, and depth; to get over my fear of sexual rejection; and, of course, to attain a sense of worthiness, which Rasputin defined as the belief that one deserves the best the world has to offer. It was easy to memorize routines, but mastering inner game after a lifetime of bad habits and thought patterns was not easy. These guys, however, had the tools to fix me in time for Mystery’s next workshop in Miami. “We’re going to reframe you to where you’re not glad to have some boopsy sucking your dick,” Steve explained. “It will be a privilege for her to get to drink from the nectar of the master.” At each session, they’d put me under, and Rasputin would tell complex metaphorical stories into one of my ears as Steve P. issued commands to my subconscious in the other ear. They’d leave open loops (or unfinished metaphors and stories) in my mind that they’d close a week later. They’d play music designed to elicit specific psychological reactions. They’d put me into trances so deep that hours went by in the blink of an eye.</em></p>

After Steve’s kids went to sleep each night, he taught me inner-circle magic he’d learned from shamans whose names he’d sworn never to pronounce. The first weekend I stayed over, he gave me a lesson in soul-gazing, which is when you look deep into a woman’s right eye with your own right eye as you breathe together. “Once you do this with her, she’s going to bond real strong with you,” he warned. His cautionary speeches were often longer than the actual teaching process. “When you do this, you become anamchara, which in Gaelic means friend of the soul. A soul friend.”</em></p>

<p><em>When we walked into the dim sum restaurant, I was shocked by what saw waiting for me. David X was quite possibly the ugliest PUA I’d ever met He made Ross Jeffries look like a Calvin Klein underwear model. He was immense, balding, and toadlike, with warts covering his face and the voice of a hundred thousand cigarette packs. My meal with him was like so many I’d had before. Except the rules were always different. His were: I. Who cares what she thinks? II. You are the most important person in this relationship. His philosophy was to never lie to a female. He prided himself on bedding women by trapping them with their own words. For example, on meeting a girl at a bar, he’d get her to say that she was spontaneous and didn’t have any rules; then, if she was reluctant to leave the bar with him, he’d say, ”I thought you were spontaneous. I thought you did what you wanted.“ He spread out in his chair like a melting shard of Swiss cheese and informed us: ”The only lies I’ll ever tell are: ’I won’t come in your mouth‘ and ’I’ll just rub it around your ass.“ It wasn’t a pretty visual. His philosophy was in direct contrast to what I had learned from Mystery, and he let me know it-all through dinner. He was evidence of Cliff’s big mouth theory, a natural alpha male. “The best thing is,” he boasted, “there are guys like me and guys like you and Mystery out there. While you’re still in the bar doing magic tricks, I’m coming back for seconds.”</em></p>

<p><em>The girls strolled to the bar, where they began talking to a transvestite in a black tutu. I moved in, not even glancing at them, and greeted the transvestite as if I knew him. I asked if he worked at the club, and he said no. It didn’t really matter what I said to him: I was just maneuvering into position, pawning him for the two-set. Now that I was in range, it was time to neg. ”That girl over there is biting your style,“ I said to the 10, the shorter of the two. ”Look at her.“ I pointed to another platinum blonde in a white outfit. ”She’s just got the same hair,“ the 10 replied, dismissively. ”No, look at her outfit,“ I persisted. ”It’s almost the exact same.“ They looked over, and here was the make-or-break moment. If I didn’t come up with something good to follow, I’d lose their interest and be branded just another weirdo. So I continued with the negging. ”You know what?“ I told them. ”You both look like strange little snowflakes.“ It was a bizarre, cryptic comment, but now I had their attention. I could sense it, and my heart began to pump faster. I continued with what I knew all along would be my true opener: ”I have to ask you something. Is your hair real?“ The 10 looked shocked, then recovered her composure. ”Yes,“ she said. ”Feel it.“ I pulled it gently. ”Hey, it moved. It’s not real.“ ”Pull harder.“ I complied, and yanked it so hard that her neck jerked back. ”Okay,“ I said. ”I believe you. But how about your friend there?“ The 11’s face reddened. She leaned over the bar and looked me hard in the eye. ”That is really rude. What if I’m bald underneath here? That could really hurt someone’s feelings. It’s disrespectful. How would you feel if someone said that to you?“ The pickup is a high stakes game, and to win you have to play hard. All I had done so far was commandeer their attention and provoke an emotional reaction. Sure, it was a negative one, but now we had a relationship. If I could turn her anger around, I’d be in. Fortunately, I happened to be trying to make a point to the students and was wearing a black mod wig and a fake lip piercing-just to show that looks don’t matter. It’s all game. I leaned over the bar and stared the 11 down. ”Well,“ I told her. ”I actually am wearing a wig, and I am bald underneath here.“ I paused, and she looked at me with her mouth open. She didn’t know how to respond. Now it was time to reel her in. ”And I’ll tell you something else. Whether I go out totally bald, in this wig, or in some crazy longhaired wig, it doesn’t change the way I’m treated by other people. It’s all your attitude. Don’t you agree?“ Everything I say in a pickup has an ulterior motive. I needed to let her know that unlike every other guy in the bar, I am not and will not be intimidated by her looks. Beauty to me was now a shit test: It weeded out the losers who got dumbstruck by</em></p>

<p><em>A guy they knew suddenly showed up and bought three shots-for Heather, Rebekah, and himself. I held out my empty hand and looked around, pretending to be hurt. Heather, who I was slowly realizing was actually a sweet girl beneath that laboriously wrought exterior, took the bait. ”Don’t mind him,“ she said, pointing to their guy friend. ”He’s just rude.“ As she called the bartender over and ordered me a shot, Rebekah threw her a dirty look. ”Remember our rule?“ she whined. I knew what their rule was: Girls like this love it when guys buy them drinks. But David X had taught me better: Girls don’t respect guys who buy them drinks. A true pickup artist knows never to buy meals, drinks, or gifts for a girl he hasn’t slept with. Dating is for tools. ”We promised not to buy any drinks on this trip,“ Rebekah whined. ”But you’re not buying a drink for yourself,“ I told them. ”You’re buying one for me. And I’m different from all the other guys.“ I’m not really that arrogant, but in the game there are rules. And the rules must be obeyed, because they work. Suddenly, Mystery walked toward me and whispered in my ear, ”Isolate!“ ”I want to show you something,“ I said to Heather, as I took her by the hand. I led her to a nearby booth, sat her down, and performed the ESP experiment. Behind me, I saw Mystery punching his fist into his open hand in slow motion. It was a code: the signal to phase shift, to slow down and move in for the kill.</em></p>

<p><em>In recent weeks, I’d figured out my own routine. It was a simple structure that allowed me to determine the direction in which I needed to take a girl: First, open. Then demonstrate higher value. Next, build rapport and an emotional connection. And, finally, create a physical connection. So now that I’d opened the set, it was time to demonstrate value and blow Heidi out. I ran a piece I’d invented after meeting the fake sisters in Miami-the best friends test. ”I have to ask you guys: How long have you known each other?“ I began. ”About six years,“ one of the girls said. ”I could totally tell.“ ”How?“ ”Rather than explain, I’ll give you two the best friends test.“ The girls leaned in toward me, thrilled by the idea of an innocous test. Guys in the community have an expression for this phenomenon: I was giving them ”chick crack.“ Most women, they say, respond to routines involving tests, psychological games, fortune-telling, and cold-reading like addicts respond to free drugs. ”Okay,“ I said, as if I were about to ask a serious question. The girls huddled in closer. ”Do you both use the same shampoo?“ They looked at each other to decide on an answer, then turned to me and opened their mouths to speak. ”The answer doesn’t matter,“ I cut them off. ”You already passed.“ ”But we don’t use the same shampoo,“ one of the girls said. ”But you both looked at each other before you answered. See, if you didn’t know each other well, you’d keep eye contact with me. But when two people have a connection, they look at each other first and communicate almost telepathically before answering. They don’t even need to speak to each other.“</em></p>

<p><em>We went out that night to see Hillary perform. Since my crush on Jessica Nixon in sixth grade, one-itis had been a regular part of my life. But in the past eight months, I hadn’t felt even a tremor of one-itis. In fact, every woman I met seemed disposable and replaceable. I was experiencing seducer’s paradox: The better a seducer I became, the less I loved women. Success was no longer defined by getting laid or finding a girlfriend, but by how well I performed. The bars and clubs became, as Mystery had coached me at that first workshop, just different levels on a video game I had to get through. I knew Hillary, in particular, would be a challenge. Not only was she sharp and cynical, but she’d seen me run around picking up women all night with Heidi Fleiss.</em></p>

<p><em>I couldn’t lose any more time; every minute was an inch higher up Hillary’s thigh that Andy Dick’s hand was moving. And I had a plan to stop it. I walked back to the table, sat down, and ran the best-friends test on Hillary and her sister, which diverted the attention to me. Then, after discussing body language, I suggested we play the lying game. In the game, a woman comes up with four true statements and one lie about her house or her car. However, she does not say them out loud; she merely thinks them one at a time. And by looking for a variation in her eye movements, you can usually tell which is untrue because people look in different directions when they lie than when they’re telling the truth. All through the game I teased Hillary mercilessly, until her body language closed off to Andy Dick and opened up to me. Andy asked me what I did for work (I didn’t realize this at the time, but it was an IOI), and I told him I was a writer. He said he was thinking of writing his own book. Soon he completely forgot about Hillary and started barraging me with questions, asking if I’d help him. He was my fan. And, as Mystery says, own the men and you own the women.</em></p>

<p><em>Sitting in his Moscow apartment, he said, he searched the Internet for guidance, until he came across the Torah and started reading. After an eye-opening trip to Jerusalem, he returned to Russia and went to a casino party, where the mafia, corrupt businessmen, and materialistic hangers-on sickened him in comparison with the people he’d met in Israel. So he packed his bags, left his week’s worth of girlfriends, and arrived in Jerusalem on the eve of Passover. ”I stopped by,“ he said, ”to ask your forgiveness for some of my past actions.“ I had no idea what he was talking about. He’d always been a great friend. ”I idealized a lifestyle and behavior that were corrupt,“ he explained. ”I abhorred kindness, mercy, human dignity, and intimacy. Instead, I used, degraded, and exploited women. I thought only about my pleasure. I despised the good instincts within me and within others, and attempted to corrupt anyone I met.“ As he spoke, I couldn’t help thinking that all these things he was apologizing for were the very reasons I had befriended him in the first place. ”I promoted and dragged you into this whole pickup thing, as if what I was doing were the highest ideal a person could live for,“ he went on. ”So, to whatever extent I am guilty of affecting the natural goodness of your soul, I am deeply sorry.“ It all made sense intellectually. But I’ve never trusted extremes, whether it be drug addiction, religious fanaticism, or zero-carb diets. There was something odd about Dustin, or Avisha. He had a hole he was trying to fill-first with women, now with religion. I listened to him, but I had a different opinion. ”I accept your apology,“ I told him, ”but with the caveat that you have nothing to apologize for.“ He looked at me softly but didn’t say anything. I could see why he was so seductive: It was those eyes that glistened like the surface of a mountain lake, that intense power of focus, that way of making you believe that nothing else existed for him except what you were saying at that very moment. ”Think about it,“ I continued. ”If a guy wants to improve his odds of meeting women, he’s going to have to make some changes to himself. And it just so happens that all the qualities women look for in guys are good things. I mean, I’ve become more confident. I started working out and eating healthier. I’m getting in touch with my emotions and learning more about spirituality. I’ve become a more fun, positive person.“ He looked at me, listening patiently. ”And I’m not just more successful with women now, I’m more success167 ful in every other human interaction, from dealing with my landlord to handling credit card overcharges.“ Still looking. ”So I guess what I’m trying to say is that I’m learning how to pick up women, sure, but in the process, I’m becoming a better human being.“</em></p>

<p><em>On my way out of the house, I checked my mailbox. Along with the usual overdue bills and raised car insurance notices was a postcard of the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. ”Your Hebrew name is Tuvia.“ The writing was Dustin’s. ”It comes from the word Tov, or good. Its opposite is Ra, or evil. And in Hebrew, Tov also means that which endures and Ra is that which is short-lived. So your essence is connected to a desire to search out and connect to that which endures-the good. But sometimes you get stuck at the bad along the way.“ On the flight, I reread the postcard. Dustin was trying to give me a message from God. And maybe he had a point. But, on the other hand, I’d had an enduring wish ever since adolescence for the power to seduce any woman I wanted. Now I was getting my wish. This was good. This was Tov.</em></p>

<p><em>Mystery and I sat down with Papa at a cafe and asked the usual questions: What’s your score? What would you like it to be? What are your sticking points? ”Well, I used to be the social chair of my fraternity,“ he began. ”And I come from a lot of money. My father is the president of a major university.“ ”Let me cut you off right there,“ I said. ”You’re qualifying yourself to us. Instead of gaining our admiration, all you’re doing is displaying lower status. A rich man doesn’t have to tell you he’s rich.“ Papa nodded stupidly. His head seemed to be surrounded by a dense invisible fog, which made his reaction time just a little slower than most people’s. It gave the impression that he wasn’t all there. ”Is it okay if I record everything you’re saying?“ Papa asked, struggling to pull a small digital recorder out of his pocket. There are certain bad habits we’ve groomed our whole life-from personality flaws to fashion faux pas. And it has been the role of parents and friends, outside of some minor tweaking, to reinforce the belief that we’re okay just as we are. But it’s not enough to just be yourself. You have to be your best self. And that’s a tall order if you haven’t found your best self</em></p>

We get stuck in old thought and behavior patterns that may have been effective when we were twelve months or twelve years old, but now only serve to hold us back. And, while those around us may have no problem correcting our minor flaws, they let the big ones slide, because it would mean attacking who we are. But who are we, really? Just a bundle of good genes and bad genes mixed with good habits and bad habits. And since there’s no gene for coolness or confidence, then being uncool and unconfident are just bad habits, which can be changed with enough guidance and will power. And that was Papa’s asset: will power. He was an only child and used to taking any measure necessary to get what he wanted. I demonstrated some of my best routines on him-the jealous girlfriend opener, the best friends test, the cube, and a new piece I’d made up involving C-shaped smiles, U-shaped smiles and the personality characteristics each conveyed. Papa recorded every word on his digital recorder. He would later transcribe them, memorize them, and ultimately use my exact words to pick up Paris Hilton.</em></p>

<p><em>I noticed Papa talking to a cute girl with short brown hair and a round face that perfectly matched his. However, she wasn’t paying attention to him; her eyes kept twinkling in my direction. This was what the PUAs, in their worst acronym ever, call pAImAI, which basically translates as an unspoken invitation to approach. (Literally, it’s a pre-approach invitation, male approach invitation.) When Papa walked away, I said something to her. Afterward, I couldn’t remember exactly what I said-and that was a good sign, because it meant I was internalizing the game, that I was getting away from canned material, that I could ride a little without the training wheels. After two minutes, I noticed she was giving me the doggy dinner bowl look. So I popped the question: ”Would you like to kiss me?“ ”Well, I wasn’t thinking about it before,“ she said, holding eye contact. I took that as a yes and moved in for the kiss. She responded enthusiastically, thrusting her tongue into my mouth and grabbing my knee with her hand. I saw a flash in the background; Papa was taking a picture. When I came up for air, she smiled and said, “I don’t have any of your albums, but my friends like your music.” My response: “Umm, okay.” Who did she think I was? Then she smiled and licked my face, like a dog. Maybe David DeAngelo was right with his whole canine-training advice.</em></p>

Let me know if we can ever do anything for you.” “ Who does everyone think I am?” I asked. “Aren’t you Moby?” So I wasn’t having an on night after all. Apparently, because of my shaven head, the hostess had thought I was Moby, and she’d told half the people in the room. All that time I’d put into seduction could be subverted simply with fame. To truly get to the next level, I’d have to find a way to flip the same attraction switches a celebrity does-chiefly validation and bragging rights-without being famous. I suppose a lesser man would have taken advantage of the situation and continued the charade. But I never called the girl. I got into the game not to deceive women, but to make them like me for me-or at least for the new me.</em></p>

<p><em>When women stand near a man but facing away from him, especially when there’s no real reason for them to be hanging out in that particular spot, it trips what Mystery calls the proximity alert system. It means they’re interested; they want to be opened. Mystery wheeled around and started talking to a delicate blonde in a strapless dress and a muscular brunette mado-rag. When he introduced me, he told them I was an amazing illusionist. We’d been winging together for month’s now, so I knew just what to do: fake them out with a couple of the practical jokes and pseudomagic tricks I’d learned in elementary school. In the field, one quickly learns that everything that was funny at age ten is funny all over again. Mystery had brought along a video camera, so he began taping the interaction. The girls didn’t seem to mind. As he isolated the brunette, I talked to the blonde. Her name was Caroline; her friend was Carly. Caroline lived in the suburbs with her family. Her goal in life was to be a nurse, but she was currently working at Hooters, despite having breasts the size of SweeTarts and a shy, withdrawn personality.</em></p>

<p><em>After watching the movie Boiler Room, about ruthless cold-calling stockbrokers, Mystery had decided that phone number’s were wood-in other words, they were a waste of paper. Our new strategy was no longer to try to call a girl for a date, but to take her on a date right away-an instant date-to a nearby bar or restaurant. Changing venues quickly became a key piece in the pickup game. It created a sense of distorted time: If you went to three different places with a g r o u p you’d just met, by the end of the night it felt as if you’d know n each other forever. ”Why don’t we all grab a bite to eat?“ Mystery suggested. We walked to a diner nearby, arm-in-arm withour instant dates. During the meal, everything suddenly clicked in the group. Carly felt comfortable enough to unleash her biting wit, and Caroline began to radiate empathy and warmth. We didn’t need any routines or tactics. We all just made fun of ourselves and each other. Juggler was right: Laughter was the best seduction.</em></p>

Now I understood why it had been so difficult to get rapport with her when we’d first met. She didn’t communicate with words; she communicated with feelings. She’d make a great nurse.  After Caroline brought in some blankets to make the hardwood floor a little more comfortable, I went down on her. I stacked her orgasms as Steve P. had taught me, until it seemed like her body was melting into the ground. But when I reached for a condom afterward, I heard the five words that had taken the place of ”let’s just be friends“ in my life: ”But I just met you.“ It was a much sweeter sound, and there was no reason to push for sex with Caroline. I knew I’d see her again. She lay on my shoulder, and we enjoyed the afterglow. She was nineteen, she said, and hadn’t had sex in almost two years. The reason: She had a one-year-old child at home in the suburbs. His name was Carter, and she was determined not to be another</em></p>

<p><em>She was clearly attracted to Mystery, however, despite having resisted his advances. So we concocted a plan: the freeze-out. It was based on my Moby experience. If women have sex for validation, Mystery figured, why not take validation away from her? His plan was to be cold and ignore her, until she became so uncomfortable that she wanted to cozy up to him just to make things normal again. We loaded the footage of Carly and Caroline into Mystery’s computer and proceeded to spend the next six hours self-indulgently editing it into a six-minute video.

Her body trembled with so much emotion that it seemed to dissipate beneath me. It felt like making love to a cloud. When she came, she didn’t make a sound. As we lay together afterward, Caroline rolled away from me. She stared at the wall and grew distant. I knew what she was thinking. When I asked her about it, she burst into tears. “I gave it up too fast,” she sobbed. “Now I’m never going to see you again.” They were such sweet words, because they were so honest. I slid my arm under her and placed her head on my shoulder. I told her first of all that every passionate relationship I’ve ever had began passionately. It was a line I’d learned from Mystery, but I did believe it. Second, I told her that maybe she shouldn’t have, but she wanted to and needed to. It was a line I’d learned from Ross Jeffries, but I did believe it. Third, I told her that I was more mature than a lot of the people she’d been with before, so not to judge me by her past experiences. It was a line I’d learned from David X, but I did believe it. Finally, I told her that I’d be sad if I never saw her again. It wasn’t a line.</em></p>

<p><em>Smack. “So?” Mystery asked. “So.” “Are you ready to commit to this lifestyle?” “I thought I was committed.” “No, for life. It’s in your blood now. You and me, we have to challenge each other. Of all the guys I’ve met, you’re my only competition. No one else has the chance to reach the throne except you.” When I was a teenager, I’d lie awake in bed, praying to God, “Please don’t let me die before having sex. I just want to see what it feels like.” But now I have a different dream. At night, I lay in bed and ask God to just let me have the opportunity to be a father before I die. I’ve always lived for experience: traveling, learning new skills, meeting new people. But having a child is the ultimate experience: It’s what we’re here for. And despite my rakish behavior, I hadn’t lost sight of that. Yet, at the same time, living for experiences also means wanting the novelty and adventure of dating different women. I can’t imagine ever choosing one person for life. It’s not that I’m scared of commitment; it’s that I’m scared of arguing with someone I love over whose turn it is to do the dishes, of losing the desire to have sex with the woman lying next to me every night, of taking a back seat in her heart to our children, of resenting someone for limiting my freedom to be selfish.</em></p>

<p><em>On the floor in front of his bed was a half-eaten plate of uncooked spaghetti. Shrapnel from the spaghetti sticks was scattered around the room. Nearby were the remnants of a black cordless phone that had been smashed against the floor. The battery dangled helplessly out of the open back. “What happened?” I asked. “I blew up at my sister and my in o m. They wouldn’t shut up.” When Mystery-or any PUA-was in a funk, there was only one cure for it: to go out sarging and meet new options. “Let’s get peacocked and go to a strip club tonight,” I suggested. Strip clubs were Mystery’s weakness. He had a list of strip club rules that pretty much guaranteed him at least a phone number every time: a in o n g them, befriend the DJ; never pay for a dance or a drink; do not hit on, compliment, or touch a stripper; stick to your material; and change the subject whenever a stripper starts reciting the stories she tells every other guy.</em></p>

<p><em>So I went back to Caroline’s house in the suburbs-to her in other and her brother and her sister and her son and her Britney Spears movies. I could tell I was becoming a burden to her and a distraction from her son. And she could tell she was becoming a bore to me. It wasn’t her constant fretting over her son I minded; it was her complete lack of initiative. The days and nights spent imprisoned in her house doing nothing were getting to me. I refuse to take time for granted. One of the primary rules of pickup is that a girl can fall out of love with you as quickly as she falls in love with you. It happens every night. The girls who start rubbing your chest and making out with you in a club in two minutes will leave you just as quickly for a bigger, better deal. That ‘’s the game. “I h a’t ‘’s life in the field.

<p><em>In the months since Mystery’s breakdown, I’d turned a new corner in my game. Once I’d gotten the number of a woman, it was easy to meet and have sex with her. In the past, I was too obsessed with trying to get some to actually take a step back, assess the situation, and act appropriately. Now, after a year of accumulating knowledge and experience, I had finally gotten out of my own head. I understood the process of attraction and the signals women gave. I saw the big picture. When talking to a woman, I could recognize the specific point when she became attracted to me, even if she was acting distant or felt uncomfortable. I knew when to talk and when to shut up; when to push and when to pull; when to tease and when to be sincere; when to kiss and when to say we were moving too fast. Whatever test, challenge, or objection a woman threw my way, I knew how to respond. When Maya the belly dancer wrote and said, ”Thanks for the multiple orgasms. Call and we can discuss when you’ll be taking me out for dinner. You owe me for the cab ride, and I feel like being taken out on a real date,“ I didn’t assume she was a bitch or pushy at all.</em></p>

<p><em>Despite my aversion to being a guru, I had clearly become one. When I talked to a woman, the room went silent. The guys leaned in close to hear what I was saying, pulling out notebooks to write my words down and commit them to memory. On returning home, I watched Ross Jeffries run a variation of my jealous girlfriend opener (about the woman who doesn’t want her boyfriend to speak to his ex from college), followed by a false time constraint. Afterward, he even e-mailed and asked for a copy of my evolution phase-shift routine. He was modeling me. And he planned on sharing these techniques in his seminars. Then Thundercat’s PUA ranking came out, and I was number one. I could no longer claim to be a student. Neil Strauss was officially dead. In the eyes of these men, I was Style, the king of the unnaturals. All over the world people were using my jokes, my comebacks, my lines, my words to meet, kiss, and fuck girls. I had overshot my goal. In the old days, I was just Mystery’s wing or Ross’s disciple or Steve P.”’s hypnotic subject. Now I had to prove myself every time I went out. Guys in the community would ask behind my back, “How is Style? Is he any good?” If I didn’t walk up to a group of girls and make out with the hottest one within fifteen minutes, they’d think I was a fraud. Before I joined the community, I had been afraid of failing in front of women. Now I was afraid of failing in front of men.</em></p>

<p><em>Though I knew my new mindset was seriously warped, I felt more ethical in many ways as a PUA than I had been as an AFC. Part of learning game was not just memorizing openers and phone game and rapport-building tactics, but learning how to be honest with a woman about what I expected from her and what she could expect from me. It was no longer necessary to deceive a woman by telling her I wanted a relationship when I just wanted to get laid; by pretending to be her friend when I only wanted to get in her pants; by letting her think we were in a monogamous relationship when I was seeing other women. I had finally internalized the idea that women don’t always want relationships. In fact, once unleashed, a woman’s physical needs are often more ravenous than a man’s. It’s just that there are certain barriers and programming walls to be overcome in order for her to feel comfortable enough to surrender to them. I got good at the game because I understood that the goal of the PUA was simply not to trigger a woman’s shutdown or flight responses. [As I write this, I look up and, I swear to God, there is a girl on top of me. She has blonde hair and a sleeveless undershirt with a black bra underneath. She is smiling at me. I am inside her. She is biting her lower lip as she rubs her clit against my pelvic bone. I can hear her gasping. She is supporting herself with one hand on my thigh and the other lightly resting on the top of the computer. “You know it turns me on when you click the typewriter,” she just said. “Can I put you in my mouth for a minute?” So fuck the stereotypical image of the writer. This is the new one. I can get work done and play at the same time.</em></p>

<p><em>So every part of the pickup is designed simply to anticipate and disarm objections-at least, when we’re talking about solid game as opposed to fool’s mate. The opener, for example, is casual. It is not perceived as a pickup attempt. You are just being a friendly stranger when you walk up and ask her and her friends, “My neighbor just bought two dogs, and she wants to name them after an eighties or nineties pop duo. Do you have any ideas?” When you start talking to a group of people, their first concern is, “Are we going to be stuck with this guy all night? How do we get rid of him?” So you give yourself a false time constraint. “I can only stay for a minute,” you tell them as you join their group, “because I need to get back to my friends.” As you interact, you pay attention to the people who seem most likely to shut you out-the jealous men, the overprotective friends. You make them feel good about themselves as you challenge, tease, and neg the target. If she interrupts you, for example, say, “Wow. Is she always like that? How do you deal with her?” If she looks shocked, you reel her back in with a light compliment.</em></p>

<p><em>You may relax, tease, enjoy, and bond with your target, who is becoming attracted to you after the negging and after leading her group. When it comes time to leave, tell the group you lost your friends and need a ride home. This will give the woman an opportunity to be alone with you without letting her friends know she plans to sleep with you. (If the logistics are too difficult, get her number and make a plan to hang out later in the week.) When she pulls up to your house, invite her in to show her that thing you were talking about (a website, a song, a book, a movie clip, a shirt, a bowling ball, whatever). But first, give her another false time constraint: Tell her you have to get to sleep early because you have a lot of work tomorrow. Say, “You can only come in for fifteen minutes, and then I’m going to have to kick you out.” By this point, you both may know you’re going to have sex, but you still have to play solid game so she can tell herself later that it just happened.</em></p>

<p><em>Show her around the house. Get her a drink. Tell her you’re dying to play her a really funny five-minute video clip. Unfortunately, the TV in your living room is broken, but there’s one in your bedroom. Of course, there are no chairs in your bedroom, only a bed. When she sits on the bed, position yourself as far away from her as possible. Allow her to feel comfortable, perhaps even confused that you’re not hitting on her. If you touch her, pull back afterward. Continue using a combination of time constraints and push-pull to amp her attraction. Keep telling her she has to leave soon. Then, at your leisure, tell her she smells nice. Sniff her slowly, from the bottom of her neck to just below her ear. This is when you use the evolution phase-shift routine: smell her, bite her arm, let her bite your neck, bite her neck, and then kiss. Unless she attacks you with lust, as you physically escalate continue talking to keep her mind occupied and pulling back just before she starts to get uncomfortable. You should always be the first one to object. This is called stealing her frame. The goal now is simply to arouse her without making her feel pressured, used, or uneasy. You make out, you remove her shirt, she removes your shirt, you start to remove her bra. What’s this? She’s stopping you from going any further? The PUAs have a name for this-last minute resistance, or LMR. Back up one or two steps, then continue. Wash, rinse, repeat. It’s not real. It’s just ASD-anti-slut defense. She doesn’t want you to think she’s easy. So you cuddle, you talk. She asks dumb questions like how many siblings you have; you answer honestly and make her feel comfortable again. Then you start from the top: You make out, then remove her bra. She lets you this time. You suck her breasts. She arches her back. She is aroused now. She gets on top of you and starts grinding. You are hard. You are excited. You want her. You lift her off and begin to unbutton her pants. She pulls your hand away. “You’re right, this is so bad,” you agree, breathing heavily into her ear. We shouldn’t be doing this.“ You make out more. You reach for the pants again. Wash, rinse, repeat.</em></p>

<p><em>You put down your computer, turn off the light, and return her affection. You reach for her pants. She stops you. She says you just met. You tell her that you understand. You turn the light on again. She asks what you’re doing. You tell her that when a woman says no, you respect that, but it just pushes a button in you that turns everything off. You are not upset. You tell her this in a matter-of-fact voice. She rolls on top of you and whines, playfully, ”No.“ She wants to have sex. All she wants to know is that you’re going to call her afterward, so that she feels good about what she did-even if she doesn’t actually want to see you again. You let her know that. You tell her, ”Take off your pants.“ She does. You enjoy yourselves and give each other many orgasms over the course of the night, the morning, and perhaps even for years afterward. One morning, she asks you how many women you’ve been with. This is the only time you’re allowed to lie.</em></p>

<p><em>Tyler Durden e-mailed me constantly. He was a persistent little brat, as I suppose I had been. He seemed to pride himself on being a provocateur. For years, nervous AFCs who were new to the community were told to take the newbie mission. It involved simply showering, putting on nice clothes, going to the nearest shopping center, and smiling and saying ”hi“ to every woman who passed by. Many AFCs found that this not only helped them overcome their shyness, but that some women actually stopped to talk. Tyler Durden advocated a new mission. He called it Project Mayhem, in honor of Fight Club. And the directive was to run up to an attractive woman and-before even uttering a word-lightly body check her, whack her on the head with something soft, or physically accost her in some other playful manner. On the seduction boards, the majority of people didn’t think. They obeyed. I could have posted that snorting birth control pills helped my game, and they all would have been lining up outside Planned Parenthood. So after reading about Project Mayhem, hundreds of sargers around the world were suddenly knocking into women with grocery carts and smacking them with gym bags. It wasn’t seduction, it was elementary-school recess. And therein lay his appeal: Tyler Durden made seduction seem playful and subversive-unlike, say, Speed Seduction, which required homework, rote memorization, and even meditation exercises.</em></p>

<p><em>After an hour of blather, I started to understand Tyler Durden. Human interaction to him was a program. Behavior was determined by frames and congruence and state and validation and other big-chunk psychological principles. And he wanted to be the Wizard of Oz: the little guy behind the curtain, pulling the strings that made everyone around him think he was a big and powerful master of the realm. I got it. I liked getting it. Now here’s the context: He grew up physically small and mentally slow for his age, he said. His father, a football coach, imposed high standards on him that he could never meet. This was all thet biographical detail I was able to gather. It felt like a lot of hard information coming from him. And I still didn’t know if it was truthful.</em></p>

<p><em>Nearly every male in the room was staring at them, trying to work up the courage to approach. I introduced them to Tyler. After saying hello, he proceeded to sit down and not speak another word. For ten minutes, he sat there in uncomfortable silence. It was the first time he had shut up all night. When I introduced them to Papa, he immediately came to life. He took the sunglasses off his head and put them on Laurie-a move Mystery had taught him in Toronto when he asked how to keep the target from wandering off while being ignored. He then started running my valuedemonstrating routine about C-shaped smiles versus U-shaped smiles. I liked watching Papa’s progress. Arbiters of cool like to say that some people have it and other people don’t. And you can tell in an instant, just from looking at someone, whether they have it. I’d thought my whole life that it was something one was born with. However, the whole community was predicated on the idea that it was something people could learn. Though there was still something mechanical about Papa, he was starting to get it. He was like an it robot. While Papa entertained the girls, Tyler Durden and I went to the other room to watch Hillary dance. She was in a birdcage, waving two massive feathered fans in front of her body. A glimpse of shoulder here. A glimpse of leg there. She had a spectacular body. Too bad I’d never sleep with her again. “Why didn’t you say anything to Laurie and her friends?” I asked Tyler. “I didn’t know what routines you had used on them,” he replied. “I didn’t want to repeat anything.” “Dude, don’t you have a personality of your own that you can use?” Hillary was wearing just feathered pasties and matching panties now. She had such soft skin. Her nose looked like a beak, though. The last time I saw her, she told me she’d had a herpes outbreak. I couldn’t bring myself to have sex with her. “Let’s go somewhere else?” Tyler nudged me. “Why? There are plenty of girls here.” She had done the right thing by telling me she had herpes. It’s better than keeping it a secret and letting me catch it. I couldn’t punish her for honesty. But now I was too paranoid to sleep with her. “I want to see</em></p>

And AMOGing-or cutting a competitive male cockblock out of a set-appealed to his subversive side; stealing a woman from the jocks who used to pick on him in school was a taste far sweeter than simply seducing a woman sitting alone in a cafe. So he watched the body language AMOGs used to lower his status in sets; he observed the eye contact they used to signify to girls that he was a creep; he analyzed the way they’d pat him on the back with so much force that he’d lose his balance. Soon he was spending more time in the field studying AMOGs than sarging women, until he slowly and painstakingly laid out a new social order-where, to paraphrase the musician Boyd Rice, the strong live off the weak and the clever live off the strong.</em></p>

<p><em>So when you have an AMOG who knows the game, you have to go further. Put him in the position of trying too hard to be your friend or joke about hiring him to do jobs that are beta to you. Say, “You’re like a comedian, but you don’t have to be funny for me to like you.” Or, “Man, that’s great. You should like design my website or something.”) AMOG: [Starts touching you to show dominance) PUA: Ha ha, dude. I’m not into guys, man. Dude, the gay club is over there. Hands off the merchandise, buddy. (The girls laugh at him, then he starts qualifying himself to you that he’s not gay.)  AMOG: (Gets in your face) PUA: (Silence) (Don’t respond. Just stand there quietly. If he keeps trying to out-alpha you and you don’t answer, eventually he looks beta because he is trying too hard to get your attention. Another trick is to make let’s-get-out-of-here motions with your eyes to the girls-mimic what they do to each other when you’re running a bad set-and they’ll leave with you.) Here are some other pointers.  If an AMOG is with the girls I’m sarging, the goal is to neutralize him. If he’s just met the girls, the goal is to blow him out.  AMOGing works best with the right body language. When you say these lines, you want to have a big smile on your face. If you can, elbow him hard in the chest or slap him on the back hard enough to make him spit up his drink.</em></p>

<p><em>And, in doing so, I’d discovered a curious phenomenon: If I told a woman that I was a pickup artist before sleeping with her, she’d still have sex with me, but she’d make me wait a week or two longer just to ensure that she was different from all the other girls. If I told a girl I was a pickup artist after sleeping with her, she was usually amused and intrigued by the whole idea, and convinced that I hadn’t been running game on her. However, her tolerance for the community lasted only until we broke up or stopped seeing each other, at which point it was used against me. The problem with being a pickup artist is that there are concepts like sincerity, genuineness, trust, and connection that are important to women. And all the techniques that are so effective in beginning a relationship violate every principle necessary to maintaining one.</em></p>

<p><em>“Has this Jeffries guy turned his character more Mackey-ish since the movie?” Cruise asked. “He’s arrogant and megalomaniacal like Mackey. But he’s not as alpha male as Mackey.” “I’ll tell you something,” Cruise said as he sat down at a table spread with finger sandwiches and cold cuts. “When I did that monolog as Mackey, we didn’t tell the audience anything about what we were doing. And the guys just started getting pumped up as I was talking. So at the end of the day, PTA and I had to get on stage and say, ”Look, man. We just want to tell you that where this character is going and what he’s saying is not good. And it’s not okay.“” Here came the lecture. First Dustin; now Tom Cruise. I couldn’t understand it. What was wrong with learning how to meet women? That’s what we’re here for. It’s how the species survives. All I wanted was an evolutionary edge. So why not work at it and learn to do it well, like I’d done with everything else in my life? Who says you’re allowed to take lessons in motorcycle riding but not in interacting with women? I just needed someone to show me how to start the engine and shift to higher gears. And I wasn’t hurting anyone. No one was complaining after I slept with them, no one was being lied to, no one was being hurt. They wanted to be seduced. Everyone wants to be seduced. It makes us feel wanted. “We made this whole speech, because the guys were taking what we were saying and going with it and getting into it. So PTA and I were saying, ”Hey man, oh my God.

<p><em>We spent the next week together visiting various Scientology buildings. It’s no secret that Tom Cruise is a member of the Church of Scientology-a religion, self-help group, charity, cult, and philosophy started by the science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. But Cruise had never taken a journalist into that world before. The more I learned about L. Ron Hubbard, the more I realized that he was the exact same personality type as Mystery and Ross Jeffries and Tyler Durden. They were wickedly smart megalomaniacs who knew how to synthesize great bodies of knowledge and experience into personality-driven brands, which they sold to people who didn’t feel like they were getting what they needed out of life. They were obsessive students of the principles that guide human behavior. But the ethics of and motivation for their use of those principles made them controversial figures.</em></p>

<p><em>Students were paired up in the classroom, role-playing the various scenarios that can occur during an interview. They had large books spread out in front of them. Everything the interviewer (or auditor, in Scientology terms) utters-every response to every contingency-was contained in those books. Nothing was left to chance. No possible convert was going to slip through their hands. What they were rehearsing, I realized, was a form of pickup. Without a rigid structure, rehearsed routines, and troubleshooting tactics, there would be no recruitment. One of my main frustrations with sarging was repeating the same lines over and over. I was getting tired asking girls if they thought spells worked or if they wanted to take the best friends test or if they noticed how their nose wiggled when they laughed. I just wanted to walk into a set and say, “Love me. I’m Style!” But after watching the auditors, I began to think that perhaps routines weren’t training wheels after all; they were the bike.“ Every form of demagoguery depends on them. Religion is pickup. Politics is pickup. Life is pickup. Every day, we have our routines, which we rely on to make people like us or to get what we want or to make someone laugh or to endure another day without letting anyone know the nasty thoughts we’re really thinking about them.</em></p>

<p><em>In the end, I took a petite, mischievous stripper with big saucer eyes named Johanna back to my house. While she was on my bed, grinding me through my clothes, she asked, ”What do you do for a living?“ ”What?“ I replied. I couldn’t believe she would ask that, but she seemed to need that piece of information in order to explain my status at the party and her attraction to me. ”What do you do?“ she asked again. And that’s when I had the epiphany: Sarging is for losers. Somewhere along the line, sarging became seen as the goal of pickup. But the point of the game is not to get good at sarging. When you sarge, every night is a new one. You’re not building anything but a skillset. What got me laid on my birthday was not sarging but lifestyle. And building a lifestyle is cumulative. Everything you do counts and brings you closer to your goal. The right lifestyle is something that is worn, not discussed. Money, fame, and looks, though helpful, are not required. It is, rather, something that screams: Ladies, abandon your boring, mundane, unfulfilled lives and step into my exciting world, full of interesting people, new experiences, good times, easy living, and dreams fulfilled.</em></p>

<p><em>I was seeing about ten different girls now. They were what the PUAs call MLTRs-multiple long-term relationships. Unlike AFCs, I never lied to these girls. They all knew I was seeing other people. And, to my surprise, even if it didn’t make all of them happy, none of them left me. One of the most important realizations I’d had in the game came from a Huna self-improvement book that Ross Jeffries had recommended, Mastering Your Hidden Self. It taught me the idea that, ”The world is what you think it is.“ In other words, if you believe that you need to have a harem and having a harem is normal, women will agree to it. It’s simply your reality. However, if you want a harem but secretly feel that it’s cheating and unethical, you’ll never have one. The only woman who wasn’t entirely comfortable with this arrangement was a short, curvy, effervescent Spanish girl named Isabel, who had a habit of twitching her nose like a rat in search of cheese. ”I only sleep with one person at a time,“ she constantly told me. ”And I wish you’d do the same.“</em></p>

By ”plowing,“ he meant blitzing a girl with line after line, routine after routine, without even waiting for a response. ”The other night, this girl was running away, and I screamed the routine at her. She came back like a fucking tractor beam. I have no regard for social conventions: I’ll pummel their asses down. You have to plow it. No situation can’t be plowed.“ ”I don’t plow,“ I told him. There were guys who won girlfriends by chasing them until they relented and agreed to meet. But I wasn’t a chaser. I wasn’t a plower. All I did was give her the opportunity to like me, and either she did or didn’t. Usually she did. ”You just fucking push push push, and it can’t not work,“ Tyler Durden went on. ”If the girls get mad at me, I’ll change my voice tone and apologize and tell them I’m not well socially calibrated.“</em></p>

He calls it Stylemogging.“ ”What’s that?“ one of the students asked. ”It’s a type of frame control,“ Tyler Durden replied. A frame is an NLP term: It is the perspective through which one sees the world. Whoever’s frame-or subjective reality-is the strongest tends to dominate an interaction. ”Style has all these really subtle ways of keeping control of the frame and getting people to qualify themselves to him. He makes sure that the focus is always on him. I’m writing a post about it.“</em></p>

<p><em>Extramask had arrived in town a week before the seminar and was sleeping somewhere in the house-I wasn’t sure exactly where, since Papa had run out of closets to stuff people into. I had hardly talked to Extramask since he’d arrived. He was always either in Papa’s room working for Real Social Dynamics, winging a workshop with Tyler Durden, or working out. I watched him for a few minutes. He was buff now, wearing a torn T-shirt and a loosely knotted tie. He was telling the students that he hadn’t lost his virginity-or even held a girl’s hand-until he was twenty-six-anda-half. It was a gimmick now, part of his routine for guys. He had become a guru too. And, along the way, he’d lost the innocence he had when we first met. “I do a lot of things with this cell phone, and it doesn’t even work,” he said, holding it up. “I just like to talk into it and pretend that I’m the man, especially if I feel uncomfortable at a club. Your cell phone is your best wingman.”</em></p>

<p><em>I hopped onto the counter and sat at eye level with him. “Let me catch you up to speed on what else has been going on,” he said. I assumed he was going to complain about Papa, but instead he wanted to talk about Patricia. She had started dating an African-American jock she’d met at her strip club, and now she was pregnant with his baby. Though she had no plans to marry him, she wanted to keep the child. Her biological alarm clock was still ringing. “I’m trying to look at this objectively,” Mystery said, straddling a chair at the breakfast table that no one used. “I’m not angry. But I am hurt. It makes me want to kill the baby and kill him.” Among the required reading for all PUAs were books on evolutionary theory: The Red Queen by Matt Ridley, The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins, Sperm Wars by Robin Baker. You read them, and you understand why women tend to like jerks, why men want so many sexual partners, and why so many people cheat on their spouses. At the same time, however, you understand that the violent impulses most of us successfully repress are actually normal and natural. For Mystery, a Darwinist by nature, these books gave him an intellectual justification for his antisocial emotions and his desire to harm the organism that had mated with his woman. It was not a healthy thing.</em></p>

<p><em>The solution is to remember that the best way to pick up women is to have something better to do than to pick up women. Some guys give up everything-school, work, even girlfriends-to learn the game. But all these things are what make one complete and enhance one’s attractiveness to the opposite sex. So put your life back in balance. If you can make something of yourself, women will flock to you, and what you’ve learned here will prepare you to deal with them.</em></p>

<p><em>When I met her at Virgin, Courtney was wearing a black dress with a sash wrapped tastefully around her torso. Her lips were painted red and full. Considering the number of ugly tabloid headlines featuring her name, Courtney looked good-pale, thin, statuesque. Soon, however, the sash was loose and dangling behind her like a tail and the lipstick was smeared. It seemed like a metaphor for her life: constantly unraveling. “If you guys are waiting for me to die, you’re going to have to wait a long time,” she began. I was the press; I was the enemy. “My grandmother didn’t die until she was a hundred and two.” This is what PUAs call a bitch shield. It was nothing personal, just a protective mechanism. I couldn’t let it faze me. I had to get rapport and show her I was human, not just another bloodsucking journalist.</em></p>

If the guy becomes uncomfortable, he fails; however, if he takes the bait and gets excited or says something sexual in response, he also fails.

And every time you think, they go down and to the left. That means you’re a kinesthetic person. You’re someone who lives in her feelings.“ ”Oh my God,“ she said. ”That’s totally true.“ Of course it was. It was one of the value-demonstrating routines I’d developed. The eye goes to one of seven different positions when someone thinks: Each position means the person is accessing a different part of their brain. As I taught her how to read different types of eye movements, she clung to every word. Her legs uncrossed and she leaned in toward me.</em></p>

<p><em>Now that he was living with a woman, Mystery didn’t feel the need to go out anymore. To him, clubs were for sarging. To Katya, though, they were for dancing. So she started going clubbing without him. After a while, Mystery hardly left his room or, for that matter, his bed. It was hard to tell whether he was just being lazy, or if a depression was coming on. There’s a pattern the pickup artists have called rocks versus gold. It’s a speech a man gives a woman he’s dating when she stops having sex with him. He tells her that women in a relationship want rocks (or diamonds) while men seek gold. Rocks, for a woman, are wonderful nights out, romantic attention, and emotional connection. Gold for a man is sex. If you give a woman only gold or a man just rocks, neither will be satisfied. There must be an exchange. And Katya was giving Mystery the gold, but he wasn’t giving her the rocks. He wasn’t taking her out at all. It wasn’t long before they began to resent each other. He’d say, “She gets drunk every night. It’s driving me crazy.” She’d say, “When I met him, he had all these plans and ambitions. Now he never leaves his bed. What’s the point?” He’d say, “She never shuts up. She’s constantly yapping about something pointless and bouncing off the walls.” She’d say, “I’m getting wasted every night because I don’t want to be in a reality that’s so sad.” Mystery needed a more passive girl. Katya needed a more active man.</em></p>

All we had figured out were a few simple cause and effect relationships. If you lower a woman’s selfesteem, she will seek validation from you. If you make a woman jealous, she will become more attracted to you. But beyond attraction and lust, there were deeper feelings that few of us felt and none of us had mastered. And these feelings-for which the heart and the word love axe. just metaphorswere tearing Project Hollywood, a house already divided, further apart.</em></p>

<p><em>Courtney picked a strip of six wrapped condoms off the edge of the sink and wrapped it around her wrist like a bracelet, then began exploring the bathroom. She poked her head inside the two closets-Papa’s infamous guest bedrooms-that were on either side of the toilet. “Let me ask you something,” she said as she withdrew from Tyler Durden’s closet, which contained a suitcase, a pile of dirty clothes, and a mattress on the floor. “Do you like women?” On the other side of the bathroom’s slotted windows, Cementjaw dragged a sandbag along the brickwork of the patio. “I wasn’t a misogynist when I started this,” Tyler replied. “But you get good and you start sleeping with all these women who have boyfriends, and you stop trusting women.” A side effect of sarging is that it can lowers one’s opinion of the oppo35D site sex. You see too much betrayal, lying, and infidelity. If a woman has been married three years or more, you come to learn that she’s usually easier to sleep with than a single woman. If a woman has a boyfriend, you learn that you have a better chance of fucking her the night you meet her than getting her to return a phone call later. Women, you eventually realize, are just as bad as men-they’re just better at hiding it. “I got hurt a lot when I first started picking up,” he continued. “I’d meet an amazing girl I really liked, and we’d talk all night. She’d say she loved me and was so lucky to have met me. But then I’d fail one shit test, and she’d walk away and wouldn’t even talk to me anymore. Everything we’d built up over the last eight hours would just go down the drain. So it hardened me.” There are men in this world who hate women, who do not respect them, who call them bitches and cunts. These are not PUAs. PUAs do not hate women; they fear them. Simply by defining oneself as a PUA-a title earned solely by the responses of women-one becomes doomed to derive his entire self-esteem and identity from the attention of the opposite sex, not unlike a comedian’s relationship to audience members. If they don’t laugh, you’re not funny. So, as self-esteem defense mechanisms, some PUAs developed misogynist tendencies in the process of learning.</em></p>

She had the attitude of a beauty queen but the body of a sack of tomatoes. I took a step back and started to close the door behind me. “Hey,” she said, flushing. “This is a nice house. What do you do for work?” Those words were an instant dealbreaker. Sarging in Los Angeles, one develops a radar for women who are users. The less tactful among them will ask, within the first few minutes of a conversation, what kind of car you drive or what you do for work or what celebrities in the room you’re friends with in order to determine your social ranking and how useful you might be to them. The more tactful ones don’t have to ask questions: They look at your watch; they see how people respond to you when you talk, they listen for indicators of insecurity in your speech.

Tyler had been experimenting lately with a technique of physically pumping up his students’ mood for a night out meeting women. He believed that whether or not they actually performed better, the shot of adrenaline and camaraderie would make   them think they had fun, and thus give Real Social Dynamics good reviews in the seduction newsgroups.

<p><em>I pulled out a garbage bag full of old Halloween costumes: masks, wigs, hats. We tried them all on, taking photos with my digital camera. I was going to attempt the digital photo routine. We took a photo smiling, then serious. For the third photo, the romantic pose, we gazed at each other. Her eyes seemed so happy. Behind that tough exterior was vulnerability and tenderness. I held her eye contact and moved toward her for the kiss, holding the camera in front of us to capture it. “I’m not kissing you,” she barked. The words scalded my face like hot coffee. There was no girl I couldn’t kiss within half an hour of meeting her. What was her problem? I froze her out and tried again. Nothing. It is in these moments that, as a PUA, you start to question the work you’ve done on yourself You begin to worry that maybe she sees the real you, the one who existed before the silly nickname, the one who wrote poems about this exact situation in high school. I delivered a moving, impassioned performance of the evolution phase-shift routine. Somewhere in the distance, I heard a thousand PUAs applauding. “I’m not biting you,” she said. I wasn’t through. I told her the most beautiful love story ever written: “On Seeing the 100 Percent Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning” by Haruki Murakami. It is about a man and a woman who are soul mates. But when they doubt their connection for a moment and decide not to act on it, they lose each other forever. She was ice cold. I tried a hardcore freeze-out: I blew out the candles, stopped the music, turned on the lights, and checked my e-mail. She climbed into my bed, curled up under the covers, and went to sleep. Finally I joined her, and we slept on opposite sides of the bed. I still had one trick left: going caveman. In the morning, without a word, I started massaging her leg, working my hand slowly up her thigh. If I could just turn her on physically, her logic would disengage and she would no doubt submit. My intention wasn’t to use Lisa for sex. I knew I wanted to see her again, no matter what happened. I just wanted to get the whole sex thing over with so we could be normal together. She wouldn’t be trying to keep anything from me; I wouldn’t be trying to get something from her. I always hated the idea that sex is something a woman gives and a man takes. It is something that should be shared.</em></p>

I spent the entire day of Lisa’s return plotting the perfect seduction. I would pick her up from the airport in the limo. Herbal would drive, and I would wait for her in the backseat. Then I’d take her to the Whiskey Bar at the Sunset Marquis Hotel-walking distance from Project Hollywood. Because women don’t respect guys who pay for them but at the same time are turned off by guys who are cheap, I went to the Whiskey Bar ahead of time, gave the manager $100, and told him to make sure whatever we ordered was on the house. Afterward, I planned to take her home. On my computer, I wrote down all the patterns and routines I would use to combat her LMR. Now that I knew she liked me, I had the confidence to push this thing to the end. If she still resisted, then she clearly had intimacy issues and I’d have to be the one to LJBF her.</em></p>

I had almost let myself get caught. I went sarging every night in Miami, with more fire, drive, and success than I’d ever had. I’ve never been a fan of one-night stands. Once you’ve gotten that close to someone, why throw it away afterward? I’m more a fan of ten-night stands: ten nights of great sex, each one getting steamier, wilder, and more experimental as two people grow more comfortable together and learn what turns each other on. So after I slept with each woman, I mixed and matched them like jellybeans. It was my reality.</em></p>

<p><em>Male sexuality may seem on the surface like it runs rampant in societythere are strip clubs, porn websites, Maxim-svyle magazines, and titillating advertisements everywhere. But, despite all this, true male desire is often kept repressed. Men think about sex more than they will ever let women, or even each other, know. Teachers think about fucking their students, fathers think about fucking their daughter’s friends, doctors think about fucking their patients. And right now, for every woman with even an iota of sex appeal, there’s probably a man somewhere in the world who’s touching himself and thinking about what it would be like to fuck her. She may not even know him: He may be that businessman who walked past her in the street or the college student who sat across from her on the subway. And any man who tells a woman otherwise is most likely doing so because he’s trying to get in her pants, or the pants of someone else within earshot. The great lie of modern dating is that in order to sleep with a woman, a man must pretend initially as if he doesn’t want to. Most appalling to women is the male obsession with strippers, porn stars, and teenage girls. It is abhorrent because it threatens a woman’s reality. If all men really desire a woman like that, then where does that leave her marriage and happily-ever-after fantasies? She’s doomed to live them with a man who really wants that Victoria’s Secret model or the neighbor’s daughter or that dominatrix in the videos he hides in his closet. As a woman ages, an eighteen-year-old girl will always be eighteen. Love is dashed on the rocks in the face of the possibility that a man doesn’t want a person but a body.</em></p>

<p><em>When I returned home from rhe Whiskey Bar, Isabel was waiting for me. I was never going to get any sleep. ”Didn’t I tell you to call first before dropping by?“ I asked. ”I left you a message.“ There was nothing wrong with Isabel. Five years ago, I would have given up writing for a year just to sleep with a girl like that once. But she offered nothing. She was all holes: ears to listen to me, a mouth to talk at me, and a vagina to squeeze orgasms out of me. We weren’t a team; we were just a distraction for each other, a way to feel less lonely for a few hours in a big, uncaring world. We never had conversations; we had conversations, where we just filled empty space with words. At least, that’s what I thought. But sometimes, simply through the act of having sex with a man, especially if that man is a little more emotionally distant than she’d like him to be, a woman can develop feelings. She can start wanting more. ”Are you still seeing other girls?“ Isabel asked in the morning, rolling on top of me and looking aggressively into my eyes. It was a loaded question with only one right answer. I gave her the wrong one-the honest one. ”Well, I met a girl named Lisa, who I’m developing feelings for.“ ”Well, you’re going to have to choose between her and me.“ In the past, I used to fall for ultimatums. But I’d since learned that ultimatums are expressions of powerlessness, empty threats designed to try to influence a situation someone has no control over. ”Just by asking me to make that choice,“ I said, ”you’re setting yourself up to be the loser.“ She dropped her head onto my shoulder and cried.

They believe that the techniques they used to manipulate their fathers will work just as well on the rest of the world, and often they’re right.

Even when the cat died, he just said, “That’s life.”“ ”What I think is happening,“ Martina said, ”is that withour father gone, he’s starting to realize that Dad was never as bad as he remembered. So now he’s allowing himself to be more like Dad.“ I reflected back on my conversation with Mystery at the Trans-Dniester border. He’d made his dad out to be a monster. ”So your dad wasn’t as bad as Mystery always said?“ ”The problem is that they were too similar,“ Martina explained. ”Dad could take over any room he walked into. He was very charismatic but also very stubborn. They never got along. Mystery would always do things to antagonize Dad. And Dad, instead of acting like an adult, would blow up at him.“ ”We’d have to put them on opposites sides of the table,“ Mystery’s mom cut in, ”and if one so much as looked at the other wrong, a fight would break out.“</em></p>

<p><em>”There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you,“ I said as the heat lamps on the restaurant patio scalded our scalps and the sake warmed our stomachs. The question had been giving me insomnia for weeks. ”What happened to you after Atlanta? We had plans and you broke them.“ ”You were rude on the phone,“ she said. ”And I didn’t think we had definite plans anyway.“ So it had been her version of cat-string theory, punishing me for bad behavior. ”I was being cocky funny. I wanted to see you.“ ”Whatever. You were rude. You were being too-cool-for-school and so laid-back and aloof about things that it was a turnoff. I thought, “I can get anybody, and all of a sudden this guy is acting like Mr. Cool?”“ As we talked, I tried to figure out why I liked this girl so much, why after meeting so many people she had become my obsession. A cynical part of me said I was simply falling for the female equivalent of the tactics we use.</em></p>

<p><em>For hours, we lay there making out and dissecting the connections and misunderstandings of the past few weeks. While Lisa slept in the morning, I crept downstairs with my phone book. I called Nadia and Hie and Susanna and Isabel and the Jessicas and every FB and MLTR and other acronym I was seeing and told them I had started spending time with someone I wanted to be faithful to. ”So you’re choosing her over me?“ Isabel asked angrily. ”It’s not an intellectual choice.“ ”Is she better in bed or something?“ ”I don’t know. We’ve only kissed.“ ”So you made out with some girl,“ she said, with a weak attempt at a cruel laugh, ”and you want to get rid of me now.“ ”It’s not that I want to get rid of you. I’d still like to see you, but as a friend.“ I could hear the word pierce her heart like a dagger, as it had my own heart so many times before I’d joined the community. ”But I love you.“ How could she love me? She needed to go fuck a dozen other guys to get over her one-itis. ”I’m sorry,“ I said. And I was. There is a downside to casual sex: Sometimes it stops being casual. People develop a desire for something more. And when one person’s expectations don’t match the other person’s, then whoever holds the highest expectations suffers. There is no such thing as cheap sex. It always comes with a price. I had violated one of Ross Jeffries’s only ethical rule of seduction: Leave her better than you found her.</em></p>

<p><em>I leaned over the edge of the Jacuzzi and dipped my hand into the pool. It was just as warm as the hot tub. Someone had left the heat on again. Our gas bill was going to be astronomical ”Do you know the story of the frog and the scorpion?“ Mystery asked. ”No, but I love analogies.“ I jumped into the pool and treaded water as Mystery leaned over the edge of the hot tub and recited the story. ”One day, a scorpion stood on the side of a stream and asked a frog to carry it to the other side. “How do I know you won’t sting me?” the frog asked. “Because if I sting you, I’ll drown,” the scorpion said. “The frog thought about it and realized that the scorpion was right. So he put the scorpion on his back and started ferrying him. But midway across the stream, the scorpion plunged its stinger into the frog’s back. As they both began to drown, the frog gasped,” Why?“” “The scorpion replied, ”Because it is my nature.“” Mystery took a triumphant sip of his screwdriver, then fixed his gaze on me as I floated in the pool beneath him. He spoke slowly and deliberately, like the Mystery who’d first told me to snap and shed the boring skin of Neil Strauss. “It is your nature,” he continued. “You are a pickup artist now, You are Style. You’ve bitten from the apple of knowledge. You cannot go back to the way you were before.”</em></p>

<p><em>When I’d gone impotent in the bathroom with the porn star, perhaps it didn’t have anything to do with the whiskey. My body was responding to the lack of emotional foreplay: I neither cared about nor really desired her. And I’m sure she felt the same. It was just entertainment. Sex with Lisa was not entertainment. It was not about validation and ego-gratification, as with all those pickups I’d been so proud of. It was about creating a vacuum where nothing else existed except the two of us and our passion. It made the rest of existence seem like a distraction.</em></p>

<p><em>“Is that your girlfriend?” he asked, looking Lisa up and down manonlecherous way. I couldn’t imagine him ever being lecherous. “You didn’t tell me how gorgeous she was.” “Thanks. I can’t remember ever feeling this fulfilled by someone.” “So you got tired of picking up women?” “Yeah, after a while it started to feel like filling a bucket with a hole in it.” “Exactly,” he exclaimed. “Cameron Crowe and I, when we were doing Vanilla Sky, would talk about what a one-night stand is and what a fuck buddy is. And when you kind of get down to it, those things are a false intimacy. And they’re unsatisfying. In a real relationship, sex means more. You just want to keep going, and you want to hang out all the time and talk about life. It’s very cool.” “Yes, but the problem is that I don’t want this to be the end of my journey in this subculture. It just reaffirms society’s message of monogamy and true love conquers everything and all those Hollywood happy endings. It seems so cheesy.” “Who says it’s cheesy?” Cruise asked, his eyes narrowing and his hands reaching out to attack me with a friendly gesture. “You know what? I got past that. Since when is it cheesy to be in love?” He had AMOGed me again.</em></p>

<p><em>“It’ll be Mystery and Style, just like the old days,” he persisted. He opened the front door of the house and carried a suitcase onto the landing as he delivered one of the many great aphorisms that he used to turn defeat into triumph. “Where there’s a problem, there’s an opportunity.” “I can’t go through this again.” The words, apologetic, came out accusatory. “I understand,” he said. “Sometimes events turn sour, and we follow bad threads in our lives. I want you to know that, even though we haven’t seen eye to eye lately, I will always be your friend, for life and a day. You don’t have to manage your relationship with me. Enjoy your girlfriend, and we will always have time to hang out together. You are the most important man in my life.” My face swelled and my eyes tingled with the first flush of tears. “Try not to queer that up, okay?” he smiled weakly, choking back emotion himself.</em></p>

<p><em>First Extramask, then Mystery, then Sickboy, and now Playboy. I was on a sinking ship. “Do you have a few minutes?” he asked. “I want to get something off my chest before I leave.” Playboy brought me into his room and shut the door. “They’re trying to freeze you out,” he said. “Who’s trying to freeze me out?” “Papa and Tyler Durden. They’re using tactics on you.” “What are you talking about? What do you mean by tactics?” “Wow, you really have no idea what’s been going on up in Papa’s room. Tyler Durden is telling everyone to ignore you. He wants you to think that everyone hates you. He’s trying to make you uncomfortable in the house.” “Why would he want to do that?” “He wants to take over. And he can’t have you here because you threaten him.” This explained the head games Tyler Durden was playing the other day, the reason he was trying to make me think everyone was against me. He was attempting to drive me out. He was running game on me.</em></p>

<p><em>“The biggest mistake you and Mystery made,” Playboy concluded, “was having Papa move into this house.” There was a lesson here, perhaps the last one this community would teach me. And that was always to follow my instincts and first impressions. I hadn’t trusted either Papa or Tyler Durden when I’d first met them. I found Papa spoiled and robotic, and Tyler Durden soulless and manipulative. And though they’d made great leaps forward when it came to fashion and game, Mystery was right: The scorpion can’t deny its nature. Yet, at the same time, Mystery and I weren’t entirely blameless. We had used Papa as a patsy to sign the lease and pay for the most expensive room. We had never attempted to befriend him or treat him as an equal. When I was checking e-mail later on my computer in the office area of the house, I noticed a program called Family Key Logger. I would have ignored it if it weren’t for the paranoia I’d developed as a result of my discussion with Playboy. So I Googled the name of the program. When 1 saw the results, anger swung through my body like a wrecking ball. Someone had installed software that was capturing every word typed on the keyboard and storing it in a text file. The computer was intended as a shared resource so that residents and guests could check the Internet. This meant that whoever had installed the program now had everyone’s passwords, credit card numbers, and private e-mails. Unbeknownst to me, there had been a war going on in the house from the moment we’d moved in.</em></p>

<p><em>Are you aware of the seduction community? I am. But I look at it with the sense of being imitated. Part of what came along after my book was repellant to me. I don’t believe in doing things that twist and turn a person. I was never interested in conquering women madespotic way. I was interested in finding somebody to love. However, I didn’t stay passionately interested in seduction. I felt like there were too many other things I wanted to do. What made you get over it? I lost interest after getting married, gaining more confidence in myself, and realizing that accumulating dozens of notches in my belt wouldn’t cure my existential despair. What also helped was having two daughters who have occasionally accused me of being sexist, which I am mildly, I guess. What was your existential despair? I think the existential dilemma is: We’re social animals, so we all wrestle with a sense of inadequacy. But when we realize that we’re not as inadequate as we thought we were, and when we realize that everybody else also thinks they’re inadequate, then that ache goes away and the idea that we’re not a person of value disappears to some extent. And what about those people who don’t get rid of their sense of inadequacy? They become obsessed with sleeping with more and more women. And that’s a problem. Then there are the kinds of guys who need to be in therapy sessions.</em></p>

<p><em>What do you think is the difference between naturals and guys like us who need to learn analytically? I think that naturals have the psychological power to do it. Toward the end of my singlehood, I found a boldness that was shocking. I developed the courage to tell a woman after a glass of wine, “I’d like to fuck you.” There are some women looking for you to be bold and a leader. It took me a long time to learn that. Something strange happened to Eric Weber when the conversation veered toward naturals and tales from the field. He came to life. The spark in his eyes brightened. For a half hour, we swapped stories and theories about the game. For all his talk of marriage and happily ever after, beneath the surface still seethed that awkward guy who was envious of his friends’ success with women.</em></p>

<p><em>After we talked, he showed me a scene from the movie he was editing. It was about a pale, bald, unemployed middle-aged man shopping a terrible screenplay and sponging off his ex-wife, who was now married to a handsome, successful man. “Is that screenwriter in the movie the way you really see yourself?” I asked as we walked out of the building together. “That’s the inner me,” he admitted. “Inside I sometimes feel pathetic, awkward, and unloved.” “Even after all the confidence you acquired as a pickup artist, a husband, and a father?” “Well,” he said, opening the door to his car, “all you can do is put on an appearance of confidence sometimes.</em></p>

<p><em>Lisa sat up and took a sip from the bottle of beer she had brought upstairs. “Everyone was hitting on me tonight,” she giggled. Modesty was never her strong suit. “I hope you realize that you are dating the most fabulous girl in L.A.” In response, I wordlessly pulled open my bottom dresser drawer, grabbed two large manila envelopes from inside, and brought them to the bed. I turned the first envelope upside down and dumped its contents onto the comforter. Hundreds of paper scraps, matchbooks, business cards, cocktail napkins, and torn receipts spilled out. Each one contained the handwriting of a different girl. Then I emptied the second envelope onto the bed-full of more of the same-until there was a small mountain of paper scraps. They were all phone numbers I’d collected since taking that first fateful workshop with Mystery. “I know you are,” I finally answered her. “I’ve spent two years meeting every girl in L.A. And out of them all, I chose you.” It was the most beautiful thing I’d said in a long time. And, after I spoke it, I realized it wasn’t entirely accurate. If there was anything I’d learned, it’s that the man never chooses the woman. All he can do is give her an opportunity to choose him.</em></p>

<p><em>Watching The Wizard of Oz as a child, I was always disappointed when Glinda the Good Witch told Dorothy that she’d possessed the power to return home since the moment she had arrived in Oz. Now, twenty years later, I understood the message. I had possessed the power to leave the community all along, but I hadn’t reached the end of the road until now. I still believed that these guys had something I didn’t. Yet the reason all the gurus latched on to me-the reason Tyler Durden wanted to be me, even though he hated me-was that they thought I had something they lacked. We were all searching outside ourselves for our missing pieces, and we were all looking in the wrong direction. Instead of finding ourselves, we’d lost our sense of self. Mystery didn’t have the answers. A blonde 10 in a twoset at the Standard didn’t have the answers. The answers were to be found within.</em></p>
