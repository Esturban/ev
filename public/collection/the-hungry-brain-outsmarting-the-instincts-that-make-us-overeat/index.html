<p><em>In 1887, Wilbur Atwater, the father of modern nutrition science, described how the potential energy in food fuels the furnace of the human body: The same energy from the sun is stored in the protein and fats and carbohydrates of food, and the physiologists to-day are telling us how it is transmuted into the heat that warms our bodies and into strength for our work and thought. Recognizing the power of energy as a way to understand our bodies, Atwater’s team was the first to exhaustively measure the calorie content of different foods by burning them in his energy-measuring “calorimeters.” When you see a calorie value on the side of your box of cereal, it was calculated using formulas Atwater developed by measuring the calorie content of food and adjusting it for the intricacies of human digestion and metabolism.11 (The values are actually in kilocalories, or thousands of calories, which is denoted by capitalizing the word Calorie, a convention begun by Atwater.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 13 (location ~ 168-177)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Atwater and his colleagues also constructed a giant live-in calorimeter to measure the combustion of food by the human body. This calorimeter was large enough to provide a modest living space for experiments lasting multiple days. Atwater’s system was so effective that it was able to demonstrate with greater than 99 percent accuracy that the energy entering a weight-stable person as food is equal to the energy leaving the body. In other words, in a person neither gaining nor losing weight, the number of calories consumed is equal to the number burned.12 This statement can be rearranged as the energy balance equation: Change in body energy = energy in - energy out Energy enters the body as food, and it leaves as heat after we’ve used it to do metabolic housekeeping, pump blood and breathe, digest food, and move our bodies. We also use it to build lean tissues, such as muscle and bone, during growth. Any energy that’s left over after the body has used what it needs is stored as body fat, technically called adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is the major energy storage site of the body, and it has an almost unlimited capacity. When you eat more calories than you burn, the excess calories are primarily shunted into your adipose tissue. Your adiposity, or body fatness, increases. It really is as simple as that, although as we’ll see in later chapters, the implications are not as straightforward as they initially appear. Atwater also discovered that chemical energy from different types of foods, including those rich in carbohydrate, fat, protein, and alcohol, is effectively interchangeable in the body: Roughly speaking, all calories are the same as far as the human furnace is concerned.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 13 (location ~ 177-192)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Some foods are nevertheless more fattening than others, but this appears to be primarily because they coax us to eat more calories, not because they have a special effect on our metabolic rate.13 With this in mind, we can adapt the energy balance equation to describe long-term changes in adiposity: Change in adiposity = food calories in - calories out To gain fat, you must eat more calories, burn fewer calories, or both. To lose fat, you must eat fewer calories, burn more calories, or both. It’s a simple concept, although applying it to weight loss can be surprisingly difficult, as many people know all too well. If this principle is true, then we should expect to see that Americans began eating more calories, and/or burning fewer calories, as our waistlines expanded. Let’s have a look.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 14 (location ~ 196-204)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Measuring calorie intake in an entire country is a challenging task. Yet researchers have so far managed to do it in three different ways. The first way is to measure food production, adjust for the amount that’s being exported and imported, try to account for loss due to food waste, and see how many calories are left per person. The second way is simply to ask a representative sample of people what they eat and tally up the calories. The third way is to mathematically model the relationship between body weight and calorie intake, and use that model to calculate the change in calorie intake that should be required to produce the observed increase in weight.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 15 (location ~ 206-210)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Right about now, you might be putting on your skeptic hat. One pound of body fat contains about 3,500 Calories, so if we’re really overeating by 218 Calories per day, shouldn’t we be gaining a pound of fat every sixteen days—twenty-three pounds per year—and requiring a forklift to get around after a decade or two? Actually, despite the popularity of this type of back-of-the-envelope math among popular media sources, public health authorities, doctors, and even some researchers, that’s not how adiposity works. Hall and his colleagues have shown that this way of estimating changes in adiposity is way off target—and the consequences of this error have important implications for how we think about weight gain and weight loss.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 16 (location ~ 216-222)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And so it is for adiposity. When your calorie intake increases, your body weight increases, and this extra tissue burns calories.14 Gradually, as your body enlarges, your calorie expenditure comes to match your extra calorie intake, and you reach a weight plateau. You’re no longer eating more calories than you’re burning, so your weight and adiposity stabilize at a higher level. The same plateau effect happens in reverse when a person cuts her calorie intake. What are the practical implications of this? An important one is that it takes a larger change in calorie intake to gain—or lose—weight than most people realize. Making small changes to your diet, such as cutting out one slice of toast per day, will lead to correspondingly small changes in adiposity that don’t continue to accrue indefinitely. The new, evidence-based rule of thumb is that you must eat ten fewer Calories per day for every pound you want to lose. Yet it takes several years to arrive at a new stable weight, so most people will want to start with a larger calorie deficit to reach their target weight more quickly and then use the ten-Calorie rule of thumb to maintain the loss.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 17 (location ~ 234-243)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In 1909, our high calorie intake was appropriate for our high calorie needs. As our lifestyles gradually became more mechanized over the course of the next half century, physical activity declined substantially. Fewer of us were working the fields with plows and hoes, and more of us were sitting behind a steering wheel, as demonstrated by the massive increase in automobile registrations shown in figure 5. Until 1913, fewer than one out of one hundred Americans had an automobile. Today, there are eight automobiles for every ten of us.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 266-270)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>When calorie expenditure decreases and calorie intake increases, the energy balance equation leaves only one possible outcome: fat gain. We gained fat as we ate more calories than we needed to remain lean, given our physical activity level. In other words, we overate. For most of human history, including the majority of the twentieth century in the United States, nearly everyone was able to approximately match their calorie intake to their calorie needs without even thinking about it. Yet mysteriously, since then, something has caused our calorie intake to uncouple from our true needs. Something pushed us to overeat.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 20 (location ~ 277-281)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To see if he could design a faster and more effective way to fatten rats, Sclafani went to the supermarket and bought a variety of calorie-dense “palatable supermarket foods,” including Froot Loops, sweetened condensed milk, chocolate chip cookies, salami, cheese, bananas, marshmallows, milk chocolate, and peanut butter. When Sclafani placed these foods into the rats’ cages, along with the obligatory standard rodent pellets and water, the rats immediately gorged on the human food, losing interest in their boring pellets. On this diet, they gained weight at an unprecedented rate. In a few short weeks, the rats were obese, and neither exercise nor an enriched environment were able to prevent it (although exercise did attenuate it). Sclafani named this the “supermarket diet,” although most researchers now call it the “cafeteria diet.” Sclafani’s study was published in 1976, and to this day, the cafeteria diet remains the most effective way to get a normal rat or mouse to overeat—far more effective than diets that are simply high in fat and/or sugar. This leads us to a disturbing conclusion: Palatable human food is the most effective way to cause a normal rat to spontaneously overeat and become obese, and its fattening effect cannot be attributed solely to its fat or sugar content. If that’s true, then what does this food do to humans?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 21 (location ~ 292-302)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The experiment was a success: Ravussin’s team was able to accurately measure food intake in people who were selecting their own food, and at the same time take a number of other informative metabolic measurements. Yet during the course of the study, something remarkable dawned on Ravussin: The volunteers were overeating tremendously. “People were on average eating almost double the amount they needed,” he recalls. To be precise, the volunteers averaged 173 percent of their normal calorie needs, overeating from day one until the end of the experiment. Over the course of the seven-day study, the men gained an average of five pounds each. Over the next three years, Ravussin’s team published two additional “human cafeteria diet” studies. These studies tested the vending machine setup with men, women, lean people, people with obesity, Caucasians, and Native Americans. In each case, volunteers locked in a metabolic ward with a variety of free, tasty foods overate substantially, without being asked to overeat. Ravussin named this phenomenon opportunistic voracity.</em></p>

<p><em>Because lampreys are our most distant vertebrate relatives, comparing their brains to the brains of mammals reveals the common elements of all vertebrate brains: the core processing circuits that form the foundation of the human mind. Grillner’s research has shown that within the pea-sized brain of these primitive creatures lie the seeds of the human decision-making apparatus.17 If we are to fathom our own eating behavior, we have to understand the fundamentals of how the brain makes decisions, and the lamprey is an excellent place to start.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 353-358)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>According to researchers in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, an effective selector must have certain key properties, whether it exists in a computer or in a brain: 1. The selector must be able to choose one option. If there are incompatible options, such as fleeing a predator or mating, the selector must be able to pick only one and allow it access to the resources necessary to execute its program. 2. The selector must be able to choose the best option in any given situation. For example, if a lamprey sees a dangerous predator, it should flee.19 A lamprey that tries to mate when it sees a dangerous predator won’t survive and won’t pass on its genes to the next generation of lampreys. 3. The selector must be able to select decisively between options. If one option is only slightly better than the others, it still must win definitively, shutting off all incompatible options completely. A lamprey that tries to mate and flee at the same time is probably not going to leave many offspring.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 26 (location ~ 373-382)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Many of these action bids originate from a region of the lamprey brain called the pallium, which is thought to be involved in planning behavior. Each little region of the pallium is responsible for a particular behavior, such as tracking prey, suctioning onto a rock, or fleeing predators. These regions are thought to have two basic functions. The first is to execute the behavior in which it specializes, once it has received permission from the basal ganglia. For example, the “track prey” region activates downstream pathways that contract the lamprey’s muscles in a pattern that causes the animal to track its prey. The second basic function of these regions is to collect relevant information about the lamprey’s surroundings and internal state, which determines how strong of a bid it will put in to the striatum22 (figure 7). For example, if there’s a predator nearby, the “flee predator” region will put in a very strong bid to the striatum, while the “build a nest” bid will be weak. If the lamprey is hungry and it sees prey, the “track prey” bid will be strong, but the “suction onto a rock” bid will be weak.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 28 (location ~ 398-408)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Each little region of the pallium is attempting to execute its specific behavior and competing against all other regions that are incompatible with it. The strength of each bid represents how valuable that specific behavior appears to the organism at that particular moment, and the striatum’s job is simple: Select the strongest bid. This fulfills the second key property of a selector—that it must be able to choose the best option for a given situation. At the same time that the striatum selects the strongest bid, it shuts down competing bids. So once the “flee predator” bid has won the competition, bids like “suction onto a rock” and “track prey” get bounced. This fulfills the third key property of a selector—that it must be able to select decisively, picking one option and shutting down all competitors.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 29 (location ~ 408-415)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Most people would agree that the human brain is a bit more sophisticated than the brain of a lamprey. All right, a lot more sophisticated. One of the things that sets mammals apart from most other creatures on earth is the tremendous complexity of our nervous systems, which allows us to make remarkably smart decisions. To understand just how useful our high-powered model is, consider how much energy it guzzles. In humans, the brain eats up one-fifth of our total energy usage, even though it accounts for only 2 percent of our body weight. The fact that evolution allowed us to bear this energy-hogging ball and chain is a testament to its importance. Making smart decisions is a good evolutionary strategy, and no animal does it better than humans.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 30 (location ~ 432-437)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>I’ll spare you the description of all the decisions you have to make while riding to the restaurant, choosing from the menu, and eating your food. The point is that many of our behaviors are thought to result from a cascading series of competitions within motivational, cognitive, and motor brain regions. The winning motivation initiates subsequent competitions in cognitive areas that are relevant to fulfilling that motivation, and then the cognitive areas initiate competitions in motor areas that are relevant to physically executing the plan of action. The strength of each bid is determined by experience, internal cues, and external cues, and the basal ganglia only allow the strongest bids to express themselves. This process occurs beyond our conscious awareness—we only become aware of bids after they’re selected.28 This is consistent with Daniel Kahneman’s idea (discussed in the introduction) that most of what happens in the brain, including many decision-making processes, is nonconscious.</em></p>

<p><em>Fortunately, modern medicine has developed drugs that help relieve the debilitating motor impairments of Parkinson’s disease. Most of these are designed to increase dopamine signaling in the brain. The most effective and commonly used drug is the dopamine precursor L-dopa. When taken orally, L-dopa enters the circulation, and some of it crosses into the brain. Once inside the brain, it’s taken up by dopamine-producing neurons and converted into dopamine. Although there’s currently no way to regenerate lost cells in the substantia nigra, L-dopa makes the remaining cells, and perhaps even other cell types that don’t normally contain dopamine, produce more dopamine to compensate for the deficit.29 Higher levels of dopamine make the dorsal striatum more sensitive to incoming bids from motor regions and enables patients to move more normally once again.</em></p>

<p><em>Jim was suffering from a rare disorder called abulia, which is Greek for “an absence of will.”31 Patients who suffer from abulia can respond to questions and perform specific tasks if prompted, but they have difficulty spontaneously initiating motivations, emotions, and thoughts. A severely abulic patient seated in a bare room by himself will remain immobile until someone enters the room. If asked what he was thinking or feeling, he’ll reply, “Nothing.” Needless to say, abulic patients have little motivation to eat.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Over the course of your life, however, you’ll develop the desire and ability to play with blocks, read written words, hit a baseball, kiss another person, hold a job, and acquire and eat everyday foods. This striking behavioral transformation is due to a phenomenon, often taken for granted, called learning. Learning is the process of acquiring new knowledge, skills, movement patterns, motivations, and preferences, or reinforcing those that already exist. As it turns out, learning—particularly the effects of learning on our motivation to seek certain foods—is one of the key reasons we overeat, despite our better judgment.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 42 (location ~ 607-611)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In order to learn, you must start with a goal. If you don’t have a goal, you can’t determine which behaviors are more valuable than others and, therefore, which should be cultivated. In the evolutionary sense, the ultimate goal of any organism is to maximize its reproductive success: have as many high-quality offspring as possible, which in turn will produce as many high-quality offspring as possible.33 But that’s not the goal we’re thinking about when we dig into a bowl of cereal; in fact, we’re rarely, if ever, aware of it. What we are aware of is a variety of proximate goals that natural selection has hardwired into our brains as a shorthand for the ultimate goal of reproductive success. For most animals, these goals include obtaining food and water, mating, seeking safety from danger, and seeking physical comfort. Humans, being more complex and social than most other animals, also seek social status and material wealth (although we can’t lay exclusive claim to this; many social animals, including chimpanzees, use favors, sex, and violence to climb the social ladder). These goals—to eat, to drink, to have sex, to be safe and comfortable, to be liked—are the fundamental drivers of motivation and learning. Because food is so important for survival and reproduction, it tends to be a very powerful teacher.</em></p>

<p><em>Ross McDevitt, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Institutes of Health in Baltimore, Maryland, gently places a mouse into a clear plastic cage and presses a thin fiber-optic cable into a tiny connector on the animal’s head. McDevitt is using a cutting-edge technique called optogenetics to specifically stimulate cells in the mouse’s ventral tegmental area (VTA). As we discussed in the last chapter, the VTA is a brain region that sends dopamine-laden fibers to the primary motivation center of the brain: the ventral striatum (see figure 14). When these fibers release dopamine, they change the activity of cells in the ventral striatum and related brain regions, with profound consequences for behavior. Previously, we saw that high overall levels of dopamine can increase the likelihood that any option generator will grab the reins of behavior—yet it has other effects that are far more elegant. Dopamine, as a matter of fact, is the essence of reinforcement. The end result of McDevitt’s experimental setup is that he can send bursts of dopamine into the ventral striatum with the flick of a switch, which will illustrate the remarkable power of this pathway in learning and motivation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 45 (location ~ 655-663)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“What we find,” explains McDevitt, “is that the mice go crazy for it. They love it.” Whereas initially the mouse nose-pokes only out of curiosity, eventually it comes to understand the remarkable significance of the little box. McDevitt’s mice end up nose-poking eight hundred times per hour—ignoring practically everything else in their cages. Other labs have shown that rats will nose-poke up to five thousand times per hour for VTA stimulation, which is more than once per second! In other words, dopamine in the ventral striatum is highly reinforcing. On a cellular level, this happens because dopamine acts on basal ganglia loops that were recently active, increasing the likelihood that they will be activated again in the future. So whatever you’re doing when the dopamine hits, you’re more likely to repeat it when the same situation arises again. The VTA basically says, “I like what just happened; I’m going to sprinkle some dopamine into the ventral striatum to make sure it happens again next time.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 47 (location ~ 672-679)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Although McDevitt evoked an exaggerated form of reinforcement by directly stimulating the VTA, this process happens naturally in our brains every day. When you accomplish a goal like eating a triple bacon cheeseburger, dopamine is released in short bursts that reinforce your “successful” behavior. This is how dopamine teaches us how to feel, think, and behave in ways that help us achieve our hardwired goals—whether or not our conscious, rational brains support them. Dopamine in the ventral striatum is particularly important for learning motivations: for example, learning which foods to crave and which to avoid. Although dopamine wasn’t discovered until a half century after his initial experiments, the Russian physiologist Ivan Pavlov was one of the first researchers to describe how animals learn to associate neutral cues with food. Pavlov’s team studied digestion in dogs, and he quickly learned that his experimental animals drooled when they saw food—an observation that many dog owners can corroborate. Pavlov also noticed, with some irritation, that the dogs would salivate even if he didn’t have any food. They had learned to associate Pavlov’s presence with food. Later, Pavlov’s team found that when they consistently rang a bell prior to feeding the dogs, the dogs eventually salivated in response to the bell alone. The dogs had learned to associate the sound of the bell with the delivery of food, and because of this, the previously neutral sound cue had acquired importance. This is the same process that caused McDevitt’s mice to learn the importance of the initially boring nose-poke box as it was repeatedly associated with a powerful reward (dopamine in the ventral striatum).</em></p>

<p><em>Your average lab rat likes cherry-flavored water about as much as grape-flavored water. So if you place a bottle of each into its cage, it will drink about the same amount from each. However, in a groundbreaking study published in 1988, Sclafani’s team showed that when they infused partially digested starch directly into the rats’ stomachs while they drank cherry-flavored water, the rats developed a preference for that flavor over the grape flavor.35 And the opposite preference developed when they repeated it with the grape flavor. Even though the starch never entered their mouths, after four days, the rats displayed a near-total preference for the starch-paired flavor. Sclafani called this phenomenon conditioned flavor preference.36 Conditioned flavor preferences are a remarkable phenomenon. The rats were totally unaware that researchers were infusing starch directly into their stomachs, yet somehow this starch sent a signal to the brain that caused the rats to increase their preference for a flavor they detected concurrently. In essence, they learned to prefer that previously neutral flavor just like Pavlov’s dogs learned to salivate at the sound of a bell. How did this happen? Further experiments showed that the rats weren’t detecting the starch itself but the sugar glucose that’s released as starch is broken up in the digestive tract. And the critical location for detection was the upper small intestine. Somehow, the intestine was sensing the glucose and sending a signal to the brain that said, “Something good just happened. Do that again!”</em></p>

<p><em>The obvious suspect is—you guessed it—dopamine in the ventral striatum. Ivan de Araujo, associate professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, and colleagues demonstrated independently of Sclafani that calories infused into the small intestine increase dopamine levels in the ventral striatum, and the more calories they infuse, the more dopamine spikes. Consistent with de Araujo’s findings, Sclafani’s group found that blocking dopamine action in the ventral striatum prevents the development of conditioned flavor preferences. “This suggests,” says Sclafani, “that dopamine may be a central component of the process.” This research paints a nearly complete picture of how carbohydrate conditions flavor preferences. As a rat eats food, its mouth and nose detect the flavors and aromas associated with the food. After the rat swallows the food, it enters the rat’s stomach and then its small intestine. The small intestine detects glucose and sends an unknown signal to the brain that causes dopamine to spike in the ventral striatum. If the food is rich in starch or sugar, a large spike in dopamine causes the rat to increase its preference for the flavors and aromas of the food it just ate—and become more motivated to seek foods with those flavors and aromas in the future. In this way, the rat becomes better at identifying and seeking foods that contain carbohydrate.</em></p>

<p><em>Flavors and smells are a quick way for the brain to gather information about the nutritional quality of a food before it enters the digestive tract. Sclafani and other researchers have shown that certain flavors on the tongue can enhance conditioned flavor preferences. For example, rats form stronger conditioned flavor preferences if they can taste the sugar as they drink it, rather than having it infused directly into the stomach. The sugar’s effects on the tongue combined with its effects in the small intestine cooperate to reinforce behavior. Other flavors work similarly. The meaty umami flavor associated with the amino acid glutamate (the principal component of monosodium glutamate, or MSG)39 increases food desirability in rats just as in humans, and glutamate also conditions flavor preferences when administered into the stomach. Sweetness indicates ripe fruit, and glutamate indicates protein-rich food like meat40—both of which are important sources of calories and other nutrients in the wild. Conversely, bitter flavors, odors of decay, and any food that has previously caused digestive distress are aversive.</em></p>

<li>Page 51 (location ~ 740-750)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Together, this shows that animals don’t seek food indiscriminately—they seek specific food properties that the brain instinctively recognizes as valuable—and most of these properties indicate high-calorie foods. These are presumably the nutrients that are critical for survival and reproduction in a natural environment, explaining why the rat brain responds to them by releasing dopamine and reinforcing the behaviors of seeking and eating them. The rat brain instinctively values nutrients that keep wild rats healthy and fertile, and it gradually learns how to obtain them efficiently, under the tutelage of dopamine.</em></p>

<p><em>you’re starting to feel like you have a lot in common with rats, you’re right. Humans share most of our innate food preferences with rats, which makes sense if you think about it: We’re both omnivores that have been eating human food for many generations. Humans and rats are born liking sweet and disliking bitter flavors, suggesting that these are deeply wired adaptations that may have evolved prior to the divergence of our species seventy-five million years ago. In addition, people of all cultures enjoy the meaty flavor of glutamate, dislike odors of decay, and are repulsed by foods that have previously caused digestive distress. Humans also have a strong preference for salt (sodium chloride)—one inclination we don’t share with rats.</em></p>

<p><em>People in China and in France enjoy sugar, salt, fat, and meaty flavors. Of course, a French person may not have much appreciation for authentic Chinese food, and a Chinese person may find the odor of strong French cheese repulsive. This is because each culture has its own set of unique flavor, smell, texture, and appearance preferences that develop as the result of reinforcement learning. Just as rats aren’t born preferring cherry flavor over grape flavor, we aren’t born appreciating the flavors and smells unique to our culture: We develop them as conditioned preferences. These food properties become enjoyable and motivating by virtue of their repeated association with innately reinforcing properties, such as fat and carbohydrate, particularly in childhood.</em></p>

<p><em>Although reinforcement is a natural process that evolved to guide us through life successfully, it can sometimes get out of hand. As McDevitt’s experiment demonstrated, when dopamine reaches very high levels in the ventral striatum, it reinforces behaviors so strongly that they can take priority over natural, constructive behaviors. This is the essence of addiction.45 It makes sense, then, that every known addictive drug either increases dopamine levels in the ventral striatum or stimulates the same signaling pathway in a different manner. Even relatively benign habit-forming drugs, such as caffeine, seem to act on the same pathway. As a result of repeated dopamine stimulation of the ventral striatum, obtaining and using highly addictive drugs like crack cocaine can become such a high priority that it outweighs food, safety, comfort, and social relationships. The option generators responsible for seeking and smoking crack put in pathologically strong bids to the striatum, overwhelming most other bids.</em></p>

<p><em>We aren’t, of course, addicted to everything. Most people have a constructive relationship with most of the good things in their lives—a relationship that can hardly be described as addiction. Yet research conducted by Ashley Gearhardt and Kelly Brownell, formerly at Yale University, suggests that some people may indeed be addicted to food. Brownell’s team examined the standard diagnostic criteria for addiction to nonfood reinforcers, such as drugs, sex, and gambling.46 They used these criteria to design a questionnaire that identifies addiction-like eating behaviors, particularly focusing on loss of control, eating certain foods despite negative consequences, and withdrawal symptoms. The questionnaire includes such items as “There have been times when I consumed foods so often or in such large quantities that I started to eat food instead of working, spending time with my family or friends, or engaging in other important activities and recreational activities I enjoy” and “I eat to the point where I feel physically ill.”</em></p>

<p><em>Among their first sample of people, most of whom were lean, 11 percent met the criteria for food addiction. Further research revealed that people who meet food addiction criteria are more likely to have obesity and more likely to exhibit binge-eating behavior. This supports the idea that the reinforcing effect of food can lead to addiction-like behavior, overeating, and weight gain in susceptible people. However, not all people with obesity meet food addiction criteria, and not all people who meet food addiction criteria have obesity, so it only offers a partial explanation for the obesity epidemic. To understand food addiction, we need to examine the types of foods that trigger addiction-like behavior. As it turns out, people don’t become addicted to celery and lentils. What foods are they drawn to instead? The following quote by Gearhardt and Brownell sheds light on the question: High concentrations of sugar, refined carbohydrates (bread, white rice, pasta made with white flour), fats (butter, lard, margarine), salt, and caffeine are addictive substances and the foods containing these ingredients may be consumed in a manner consistent with addictive behavior. Just like drugs of abuse, these food substances may not be addictive until they are processed, extracted, highly refined and concentrated by modern industrial processes; meanwhile, combinations of these look-like-food substances may greatly enhance their addictive qualities.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 57 (location ~ 827-838)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As Gearhardt and Brownell alluded to, this is similar to how drugs of abuse are often concentrated versions of less-addictive naturally occurring substances. For example, the leaves of the coca plant are widely chewed in South America as a mild stimulant and appetite suppressant reminiscent of caffeine. However, when we extract and concentrate the active ingredient of the coca leaf, this results in a much more addictive substance: cocaine. A secondary chemical process called freebasing transforms cocaine into the extremely addictive drug crack cocaine.47 Human technology has allowed us to concentrate and enhance the property of the coca plant that increases dopamine release and reinforces behavior, transforming it from a useful herb into a life-destroying drug. Similarly, modern food technology has allowed us to concentrate the reinforcing “active ingredients” in food to an unprecedented degree, and addiction-like behavior in a subset of people is the predictable result. Chocolate is a prime example of the riot of reinforcing properties that characterizes modern foods. The seeds of the cacao tree, a plant native to tropical South America, are naturally extremely calorie dense, due to their high fat content. When fermented, roasted, and ground into a paste, these seeds become chocolate: a magical substance that’s solid at room temperature and melts in the mouth. To mask the naturally bitter flavor of chocolate, we add a generous dose of refined sugar, and sometimes dairy. The calorie density, fat content, carbohydrate content, and sweet taste of chocolate are a powerfully reinforcing combination, but chocolate has another trick up its sleeve that makes it the king of cravings: a habit-forming drug called theobromine. Theobromine is a mild stimulant that’s moderately reinforcing, like its cousin caffeine.48 Although theobromine on its own may not be the bee’s knees, when added to a substance that’s already highly reinforcing, it puts many of us over the edge. It may come as no surprise that chocolate addiction is a legitimate topic of scientific research. Even those of us who aren’t “chocoholics” may experience chocolate cravings, and research indicates that chocolate is the most frequently craved food among women. Although most of us aren’t literally addicted to food, recall that addiction is simply an exaggerated version of the same reinforcement process that happens in all of us. We may not be so seduced by food that it interferes with our work or family lives, but most of us are driven to eat more calories than we should, acting against our own self-interest despite our better judgment.</em></p>

<p><em>Food that brings us pleasure when we eat it is described as palatable. Palatable food tastes good. It’s a sign that the brain values a food, either as a result of instinct or reinforcement learning. The brain presumably values certain food properties above others because they would have increased the reproductive success of our ancestors. The most highly palatable foods tend to be dense in easily digested calories and combine multiple innately preferred food properties in highly concentrated form: ice cream, cookies, pizza, potato chips, french fries, chocolate, bacon, and many others. These are the foods that are most likely to cause cravings and a loss of control over eating, because their physical properties make them exceptionally reinforcing, motivating, and palatable. Researchers have an umbrella term for this combination of effects on the brain: food reward. Highly rewarding foods are those that seduce us.</em></p>

<p><em>What happens to food intake and adiposity when researchers dramatically restrict food reward? In 1965, the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences published a very unusual study that unintentionally addressed this question. Here’s the stated goal of the study: The study of food intake in man is fraught with difficulties which result from the enormously complex nature of human eating behavior. In man, in contrast to lower animals, the eating process involves an intricate mixture of physiologic, psychologic, cultural and esthetic considerations. People eat not only to assuage hunger, but because of the enjoyment of the meal ceremony, the pleasures of the palate and often to gratify unconscious needs that are hard to identify. Because of inherent difficulties in studying human food intake in the usual setting, we have attempted to develop a system that would minimize the variables involved and thereby improve the chances of obtaining more reliable and reproducible data.</em></p>

<p><em>The first volunteer continued eating bland food from the machine for a total of seventy days, losing approximately seventy pounds. After that, he was sent home with the formula and instructed to drink 400 calories of it per day, which he did for an additional 185 days, after which he had lost two hundred pounds—precisely half his body weight. The researchers remarked that “during all this time weight was steadily lost and the patient never complained of hunger.” This is truly a starvation-level calorie intake, and to eat it continuously for 255 days without hunger suggests that something rather interesting was happening in this man’s body. Further studies from the same group and others supported the idea that a bland liquid diet leads people to eat fewer calories and lose excess fat.49 This machine-feeding regimen was just about as close as one can get to a diet with zero reward value and zero variety. Although the food contained sugar, fat, and protein, it contained little odor or texture with which to associate them. In people with obesity, this diet caused an impressive spontaneous reduction of calorie intake and rapid fat loss, without hunger. Yet, strangely, lean people maintained weight on this regimen rather than becoming underweight. This suggests that people with obesity may be more sensitive to the impact of food reward on calorie intake. Is this because heightened food reward sensitivity causes obesity or because obesity increases food reward sensitivity? This question would require further research to disentangle.</em></p>

<p><em>In 2010, Chris Voigt, the director of the Washington State Potato Commission, decided to eat nothing but potatoes and a small amount of cooking oil for sixty days. Voigt was protesting a decision by the federal Women, Infants, and Children food assistance program to remove potatoes from the list of vegetables it will pay for.51 Voigt contended, correctly, that potatoes are actually quite nutritious—in fact, one of the few foods that provide a broad enough complement of nutrients to sustain a human in good health for months at a time.52 He documented his journey on a Web site titled 20 Potatoes a Day, which refers to the number of potatoes he would have to eat to maintain his weight. Voigt signed himself up for two months of a starchy, bland, repetitive diet. Despite Voigt’s goal not to lose weight, the pounds melted off. He lost twenty-one pounds over the sixty-day period, much of it from his waistline. According to physical examinations before and after, his blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels improved considerably. He had trouble eating enough to meet his energy needs because he simply wasn’t hungry. While we may be tempted to question the veracity of a person whose job involves promoting potatoes, Voigt’s experiment triggered an avalanche of Internet copycats who used the “potato diet” for rapid weight loss. Although anecdotal, their reports suggest that eating this bland, repetitive diet does indeed reduce spontaneous calorie intake without provoking hunger.53 Yet this isn’t just because of the blandness of an all-potato diet—there’s more to the story.</em></p>

<p><em>The effect of food variety on food intake relates to a fundamental property of the nervous system called habituation. Habituation is the simplest form of learning—one shared by all animals with a nervous system. It probably evolved along with the first nervous systems nearly seven hundred million years ago, since it exists in our truly ancient relatives the jellyfish. Habituation is one of the key tricks we use to distinguish important events from unimportant noise, and it’s simply this: The more we’re exposed to a stimulus within a short period of time, the less we respond to it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 65 (location ~ 944-949)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As it turns out, this habituation process operates each time we sit down to a meal. In a pioneering 1981 study by Barbara Rolls and colleagues, volunteers rated the palatability of eight different foods by tasting a small amount of each, and then were provided one of the foods for lunch. After lunch, they once again rated the palatability of the same eight foods by tasting them. Rolls found that the palatability rating of the food the volunteers had eaten for lunch decreased much more than the palatability rating of the other seven foods they hadn’t eaten. When the volunteers were presented with an unexpected second course containing all eight foods, they tended to eat less of the food they had just eaten for lunch. This shows that we can eat our fill of a specific food and feel totally satisfied, but that doesn’t mean we won’t eat other foods if they’re available. Rolls called this phenomenon sensory-specific satiety. Satiety is the sensation of fullness we get after we eat food, and sensory-specific means this fullness only applies to foods that have similar sensory properties (sweet, salty, sour, fatty) to the ones we just ate.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>BEATING THE BUFFET EFFECT The fact that sensory-specific satiety drives us to overeat suggests a simple solution to the problem: Limit yourself to a few foods. If you find yourself at a buffet, tapas restaurant, or similar situation in which high food variety may cause you to overeat, simply choose three items you think would make a satisfying meal, and stick to them. You’ll probably feel just as full on fewer calories.</em></p>

<p><em>Several independent researchers using various methods have confirmed that we tend to eat more total food—and gain weight—when we’re presented with a large variety of foods. This goes a long way toward explaining what researchers call the buffet effect. We tend to overeat spectacularly at buffets, despite the fact that the food isn’t always the crème de la crème.54 At a buffet, we don’t have the opportunity to habituate to any particular food, because every few bites, we’re eating something new. The brain’s satiety system eventually throws the emergency brake, but not before we’ve eaten far too much.</em></p>

<p><em>“Numerous anecdotal accounts indicate that marijuana increases appetite and food intake in humans,” begins a 1988 paper by substance abuse researcher Richard Foltin and colleagues, referring to a phenomenon known to smokers as “the munchies.” But could Foltin’s team replicate this effect scientifically, or was it simply stoner lore? For thirteen days, Foltin and his colleagues confined six men to a laboratory setting where all food was provided and accurately measured. Each day, volunteers smoked either “two cigarettes containing active marijuana” or two placebo joints containing no marijuana. The primary psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, &lt;U+0394&gt;9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), activates the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), which plays a key role in the brain circuitry that regulates food reward. If these circuits really do have a major impact on food intake and adiposity, then activating them using marijuana should have a clear effect. The outcome of Foltin’s study was unequivocal: The men ate 40 percent more calories while they were stoned than while they were sober, and their body weights also climbed rapidly. Interestingly, they didn’t overeat at meals, but instead ate more highly palatable sweet snacks, such as candy bars, between meals. A number of other studies have confirmed that marijuana increases food intake, including my favorite one: “Effects of Marihuana on the Solution of Anagrams, Memory and Appetite.” I suppose even getting stoned, playing games, and pigging out is worthy of scientific study. If THC activates the CB1 receptor and this increases food intake and adiposity, then it stands to reason that blocking the CB1 receptor should reduce food intake and cause weight loss. This is exactly the rationale for the CB1-blocking drug rimonabant, or “reverse marijuana” as I like to call it.55 As predicted, rimonabant reduces food intake and causes weight loss in a variety of animals, including humans. Although the drug has demonstrated its effectiveness in a research setting and it was briefly approved as a weight-loss drug in Europe, it’s not currently approved for the treatment of any condition due to ongoing concerns about its negative side effects. Shockingly, “reverse marijuana” seems to increase the risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. Nonetheless, marijuana and rimonabant illustrate the powerful pull the reward system exerts on our behavior, including how much we choose to eat.</em></p>

<p><em>To compare this to how hard she’s willing to work for a nonfood reward, the researchers also give her simultaneous access to a second computer in the room. This computer is programmed with the exact same game, except it earns the woman access to an appealing magazine for a few minutes, rather than candy. The woman can switch between the two computers anytime she wants, and once she decides neither reward is worth the effort, the experiment is over. This simple technique allows Epstein’s team to calculate a personal characteristic called the relative reinforcing value of food (RRVfood). RRVfood is a measure of how hard a person is willing to work for food, relative to a nonfood reward such as reading material—and people differ greatly in this regard. “There are huge individual differences in that some people will work really, really hard to get access to food, and other people will only work a little bit,” explains Epstein. The fact that RRVfood measures the motivational value of food relative to nonfoods is important, because we often have the choice to do something other than eat. RRVfood asks: When faced with a choice, are you more likely to eat or to do something else?</em></p>

<p><em>These studies have produced very provocative results: first, that sweet foods are exceptionally motivating, especially to youths. “If you let teenagers work for sweet soda,” relates Epstein, “they will work really hard … People will make thousands of responses for a small piece of candy.” A second provocative conclusion is that people who are overweight or obese tend to have a higher RRVfood than people who are lean. In particular, children who are overweight or obese are much more willing to work for highly rewarding foods like pizza or candy than lean children, even if their baseline level of hunger is the same. Consistent with their heightened food motivation, people with a high RRVfood eat more food both in the lab and at home. People who are overweight or obese find food more motivating than lean people do, and this leads them to eat more. However, these studies don’t tell us whether a high RRVfood causes people to gain weight, or whether something about the overweight state causes RRVfood to increase. All they tell us is that the two are associated with one another. To begin to explore the question of whether a high RRVfood actually causes weight gain, Epstein and other researchers went back in time.</em></p>

<p><em>Drug abuse research suggests that a person’s susceptibility to addiction depends not only on how reinforcing the drug is for him but also on his ability to control his behavior in response to a craving—in other words, his impulsivity. Impulsivity describes a person’s ability—or lack thereof—to suppress or ignore basic urges that are beyond conscious control. It’s the opposite of what we commonly call self-control. A person who finds crack cocaine highly reinforcing will crave the drug intensely after he’s smoked it a few times, but if he’s able to prevent himself from acting on those cravings, he won’t be addicted. A second person who finds crack cocaine equally reinforcing but who is highly impulsive will readily become addicted. As Epstein puts it, “If you find something really rewarding and you have really poor impulse control, you’re in a lot of trouble.” Epstein coined the term reinforcement pathology to describe the dangerous combination of high reinforcement sensitivity and high impulsivity. He explains that it’s like having a “lead foot and worn brakes.” This may identify why some people are more susceptible to food addiction than others, despite the fact that we’re all exposed to potentially addictive foods.</em></p>

<p><em>Of the 2.6 million years since our genus Homo emerged, we were hunter-gatherers for 99.5 percent of it, subsistence-level farmers for 0.5 percent of it, and industrialized for less than 0.008 percent of it. Our current food system is less than a century old—not nearly enough time for humans to genetically adapt to the radical changes that have occurred. Our ancient brains and bodies aren’t aligned with the modern world, and many researchers believe this evolutionary mismatch is why we suffer from such high rates of lifestyle-related disorders, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, we can’t go back in time to observe the diets and eating habits of our distant ancestors, and today we know only a few basic facts about what and how they ate. Yet current and historical nonindustrial cultures can provide us with a rich tapestry of clues about what life may have been like for our hunter-gatherer and subsistence farmer forebears. Let’s consider two examples and see what we can learn.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 73 (location ~ 1077-1084)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As I hope our brief tour of the eating habits of two nonindustrial cultures has illustrated, the diets of our distant ancestors were probably radically different from ours today. The diets of nonindustrial cultures vary widely, yet they share important commonalities that fundamentally differentiate them from the diets of people living in modern affluent nations. If we can identify these commonalities, we may be able to understand what the diets of our ancestors were like, and in turn, what our bodies and brains are adapted to. Here are three prominent characteristics these diets have in common: First, they include a limited variety of foods. For example, although the!Kung San recognized at least 105 plants as edible, only 14 formed the bulk of their plant food intake, and only a subset of these 14 plant foods was available at any given season and location. Throughout the year, half of their calorie intake came from a single food, the mongongo fruit/nut. Over the course of the entire year, the!Kung San diet was quite varied; yet over the course of a day, it may have focused on only a few foods. Because of the seasonal availability of key resources, the same is true of most other nonindustrial cultures. Second, they have a limited ability to concentrate the reinforcing properties of food. With only the most basic processing methods at their disposal, nonindustrial cultures—and presumably our distant ancestors—are forced by necessity to eat food in a less calorie-dense, less refined, less rewarding state. Most don’t have the ability to add refined starch, sugar, salt, or concentrated fat to their meals. The glutamate they eat comes from cooking meat and bones rather than from crystalline MSG. Added flavors, such as herbs and spices, are limited. Although we can find isolated examples of traditional cultures that use concentrated fats, salt, multiple spices, sugars, or more refined starches, none boasts all the enhancements of the affluent industrial diet. Third, they use few cooking methods. The cooking methods of nonindustrial cultures are extremely limited by modern standards, with most cultures only using two or three methods. Even in affluent Western cultures, cooking methods were limited by technology until relatively recently. Until the 1820s, most cooking in the United States took place in an open hearth, which is a time- and labor-intensive method that makes complex cooking techniques difficult. Cast-iron wood- or coal-fired stoves replaced open hearth cooking in the 1820s, and they remained the dominant cooking method until they were replaced by gas and electric stoves in the 1920s. Techniques as simple as sautéing and temperature-controlled baking were difficult or impossible to perform in the home prior to these advances in technology. To the modern palate accustomed to constant entertainment, nonindustrial diets, and likely the diets of our distant ancestors, would seem repetitive, bland, and sometimes unpalatable. Fortunately for our palates but not for our adiposity, we live in different times.</em></p>

<p><em>A hunter-gatherer walking through a modern grocery store would be bewildered by the dizzying array of food choices, particularly those of high calorie density and palatability (not to mention all those boxes adorned with strange cartoon characters). The Food Marketing Institute reports that in 2013, the average US grocery store contained a staggering 44,000 items, up from an already impressive 15,000 items in 1980. In sharp contrast to the dietary habits of nonindustrial cultures, which are limited by availability, affluent industrial cultures are steeped in a vast abundance of food choices, most of which are professionally crafted to maximize reward value. This variety means we experience less sensory-specific satiety, almost like a perpetual buffet.</em></p>

Today, we spend about half of our food expenditures on food to be eaten at home, and the other half eating out (see figure 17). Much of the recent increase has come from fast-food spending, which has increased ninefold since 1960. These figures actually underestimate the magnitude of the change in US food culture, because today many of the foods we eat at home are actually commercially prepared, such as pizza, soda, cookies, and breakfast cereal.</em></p>

<p><em>Sugar holds a special place in the brain’s reward centers, perhaps because in the time of our distant ancestors, sweetness signified fruit or honey—both safe and valuable sources of nutrition. These were the only two sources of sweetness for most of human history. But we gradually figured out how to extract pure sugar from beets and sugarcane, although initially it was so expensive that only the wealthy ate it regularly. As technology advanced, concentrated sugar became cheaper, easier to obtain, and easier to use. In the 1870s, granulated sugar became widely available in the United States, making it more convenient to add sugar to food. A glass-blowing machine patented in 1899 led to the mass production of bottles, reducing the cost of sweetened beverages. Then, in the 1920s, refrigerated vending machines were invented, making it easier than ever to grab a cold, refreshing soda. The 1970s brought one of the most significant technological advances in US diet history: high-fructose corn syrup. This is a sweetener produced from corn starch that has approximately the same sweetness as cane sugar. Thanks to government-subsidized corn, it’s so cheap that food manufacturers can use it to beef up the reward value of their foods at virtually no cost, tickling the brain circuits that make us reach for the cookies.</em></p>

<p><em>Again, advances in food technology and the increasing influence of the food industry are behind this shift.

This has led some people to view obesity research as a team sport rather than a scientific discipline. Allow me to end the debate by stating what most researchers find quite obvious: It’s both. In particular, the combination of concentrated sugar and fat in the same food is a deadly one for our food reward system. It’s also a pairing that rarely occurs in nature, so it’s tempting to speculate that it’s more than our brains are equipped to handle constructively. Think ice cream, chocolate, cookies, and cake—foods we crave, and foods we don’t need to be hungry to eat. What would they be without sugar, and what would they be without fat?</em></p>

<p><em>Although MSG has a bad reputation among health-conscious consumers, humans have always sought glutamate, and throughout history we’ve found ways to get it.62 The first source of glutamate, perhaps hundreds of thousands of years old, was simply cooked meat. Once we invented cooking vessels, we began boiling bones to make a meaty, glutamate-containing broth—something we’ve probably done since before recorded history. The next step was to develop fish sauce, which is very high in glutamate as a result of the decomposition of naturally occurring fish proteins.</em></p>

<p><em>Habit-forming drugs, which are reinforcing due to their direct actions on the brain’s dopamine system,63 are also more prevalent in modern affluent foods. Caffeine and alcohol are inherently reinforcing, meaning that they drive conditioned food and beverage preferences that can contribute to overeating. Alcoholic beverages are rich in calories—ranging from 90 to 180 Calories per serving. To put that into context, two beers per day can be the difference in calorie intake between a lean person and an overweight person.64 Most American adults drink alcohol regularly, and we virtually never drink it to satisfy a need for calories. We drink it because we like it, whether we’re hungry or not. Caffeine itself doesn’t contain calories, but it’s often associated with calorie-rich cream and sugar—and as with alcohol, we don’t take in these extra calories because we’re hungry for them. And theobromine, the mild habit-forming drug in chocolate, also drives us to eat excess calories.</em></p>

<p><em>Technology has allowed us to create foods that are far more seductive than those that occur in a natural environment, and this leads to an equally unnatural response from the brain. The idea that our hardwired inclinations can be overstimulated by unnaturally powerful cues goes back to the 1930s. During a study of the nesting behaviors of the ringed plover, Koehler and Zagarus noted that the birds prefer to sit on artificial eggs that are an exaggerated version of natural eggs. A typical ringed plover egg is light brown with dark brown spots. When Koehler and Zagarus offered the birds artificial eggs that had a white background and larger, darker spots, they readily abandoned their own eggs in favor of the decoy. Similar experiments with oystercatchers and herring gulls showed that they prefer larger eggs, to the point where they will leave their own eggs in favor of absurdly large artificial eggs that exceed the size of their own bodies. Essentially, birds have an innate preference for specific egg characteristics. Ringed plovers are wired to prefer a roundish egg with contrasting spots, such that a roundish egg with larger spots and more contrast elicits a stronger preference. Oystercatchers and herring gulls are wired to prefer large eggs, possibly because larger eggs tend to be healthier, and their preference for larger eggs extends well beyond the natural range. The Dutch biologist Nikolaas Tinbergen coined the term supernormal stimulus to describe the phenomenon whereby, as he put it, “it is sometimes possible to offer stimulus situations that are even more effective than the natural situation.” Whatever a species’ innate preferences are, they can often be overstimulated by presenting a cue that’s more powerful than what the species has evolved to expect—and this can sometimes lead to highly destructive behavior. It seems likely that certain human innovations, such as pornography, gambling, video games, and junk foods, are supernormal stimuli for the human brain.</em></p>

In 2012, the ten largest food and beverage manufacturers alone spent $6.9 billion on food advertising, and fast-food restaurants spent more than $4 billion on top of that. To put that into perspective, the total amount of funding dedicated to obesity research by the National Institutes of Health, the primary funding agency for biomedical research in the United States, was less than $1 billion in 2012.

Children are particularly susceptible to food advertisements due to their naturally high impulsivity and inability to understand persuasive intent. Children in the US view more than 12 food advertisements per day on television, totaling more than 4,300 per year. And food ads don’t compel us to buy brussels sprouts! Unprocessed, low-calorie foods like vegetables are neither very profitable to sell nor particularly compelling to consumers. Food cues are most effective when they predict highly rewarding foods rich in fat, sugar, starch, salt, and other reinforcing properties, and these are the foods that appear most often in advertisements.68</em></p>

<p><em>As it turns out, biologists and anthropologists have been able to mathematically model the basic principles of efficient food seeking using a discipline called optimal foraging theory (OFT). OFT assumes that animals have been crafted by natural selection to acquire food from their environment efficiently, and researchers have successfully applied it to a variety of different species, including human hunter-gatherers. Given the bewildering complexity of human behavior, the basic math of OFT is disarmingly simple: The value of a food item, and hence whether or not it’s worth pursuing, depends on the number of calories it contains, minus the number of calories required to obtain and process it, divided by the amount of time required to obtain and process it.</em></p>

<p><em>If we examine the account of Hadza foraging above, we can identify many instances in which Maduru and Esta made important economic choices about food. Maduru set out to pursue a kudu, which is a large game animal with one of the highest energy return rates. It made sense for him to begin the search with a kudu in mind and spend a long time pursuing it, because the benefit of killing one is so great. Yet the optimal foraging strategy also involves being alert to other opportunities that may arise. For example, once Maduru spotted the smaller dik-dik, there was a good chance he could kill it and enjoy a good energy return from a short time investment. With the information that there is an unsuspecting dik-dik nearby, the energy return rate of hunting it is suddenly higher than continuing to search for the kudu. Yet if he had set out to find a dik-dik without any indication that one was nearby, he probably would have searched all day unsuccessfully. Similarly, the sound cue of the bee alerted him to a nearby nest and sent his foraging trip on a productive tangent. Honey has one of the highest energy return rates, and the Hadza will almost always drop everything to harvest it when they locate a good nest.</em></p>

<p><em>Other factors can also come into play, such as risk. Even if the most efficient way to get calories is to pick fruit from a tall tree with weak branches, it may not be worth the risk of falling. Cultural influences such as taboos also impact food selection. For example, according to Wood, “No Hadza would pursue even a large, fatty savannah monitor lizard, because snakes and lizards are simply not considered food in Hadza culture.” Nor do they eat fish because they are “like snakes.” Personal preferences, hunger, and time delays can also play a role. The bottom line, according to Hill, is that “the brain is designed to take into account more than just energy acquisition.” Yet given all the possible motivations the basic OFT equation ignores, it does a surprisingly good job of predicting foraging behavior. This underscores the fundamental importance of energy to life, and its central role in the natural selection process that shaped the brains we have today. OFT models the fundamental principles of food motivation that are wired into the brains of all humans. As it turns out, it has some interesting implications for those of us who hunt and gather, whether in the wild or in a supermarket.</em></p>

<p><em>The idea of moderation in eating is totally foreign to hunter-gatherers. In fact, Wood, Hill, and Pontzer explain that hunter-gatherer eating habits can be downright gluttonous. Hill recalls some of the enormous meals he observed among the Aché—men eating five pounds of fatty meat each in a sitting, drinking one and a half liters of pure honey, or eating thirty wild oranges similar to the fruit we buy in the grocery store. And it’s not just the Aché. Pontzer adds that the Hadza also drink honey “like a glass of milk.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 98 (location ~ 1448-1451)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Despite appearing healthy and well fed, both Aché and Hadza adults frequently report feeling hungry. This isn’t the kind of mild hunger pang that reminds us to saunter over to the fridge at lunchtime, but rather the powerful hunger a person feels when he hasn’t eaten much at all that day. “When they say they’re hungry,” explains Wood, “it’s a lot more meaningful.” In other words, instances of gluttony are balanced by periods during which they’re eating less than they would like. Meat is often available,75 but fatty meat gorges are uncommon. Honey is often available, but not usually in sufficient quantity to exceed a person’s daily calorie needs. Simply stated, there isn’t enough food to indulge their outsized appetites. Why do hunter-gatherers report feeling hungry even when they appear to have enough body fat and muscle, and why do they wish they had just a bit more food? The answer may lie in the dynamics of hunter-gatherer reproduction. If life is a game of turning energy into kids, then more energy (up to a point) means more kids.76 Since reproductive success drives natural selection, we might expect natural selection to have designed a brain that wants more energy. This is exactly what Hill thinks has happened: “Their brains are designed to want more food because more food converts into higher fertility and higher survivorship, and those things lead to higher [reproductive success].” This leads us to a key conclusion about life as a hunter-gatherer: Gluttony is good for them. Eating as much sugar, fat, protein, and starch as possible, whenever it’s available, increases their ability to thrive and bear children in a wild environment. “When those opportunities do present themselves,” argues Wood, “there’s basically no downside to going for it. It’s all upside.” Unlike in the modern affluent world, in which overeating is a major cause of ill health, in a hunter-gather environment, overeating is healthy. The same would probably have been true of our own ancestors until relatively recently in human history.</em></p>

<p><em>In the affluent world, we stalk Froot Loops, buffalo wings, and chicken nuggets rather than fruit, buffalo, and wild fowl. Most of our foods are rich in calories, and the time, effort, and monetary costs involved in acquiring and preparing them have drastically declined. If we apply OFT to this situation, it becomes clear that we’re surrounded by an enormous variety of extremely valuable foods—foods that are an outstanding deal because they deliver a large number of calories and cost very little. Despite the fact that we live in a radically different environment than a hunter-gatherer, our brains are still highly attuned to good deals (have you ever seen how fast free pizza disappears?). Yet while a hunter-gatherer only encounters great deals occasionally, in our world, we encounter them multiple times per day. This leads us to overeat by activating largely nonconscious brain circuits that are constantly looking for a deal.</em></p>

<p><em>Brian Wansink, director of the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, has conducted clever experiments that illustrate the outsized influence of effort cost on our eating behavior. In one study, he recruited administrative assistants and placed candy dishes containing Hershey’s Kisses in one of three different locations in each of their offices: on the desk, in the top drawer of the desk, or in a filing cabinet six feet away. Eating a Kiss on the desk required only a small arm motion, while Kisses in the drawer required a larger arm motion, and those in the filing cabinet required getting up and walking across the room. Each additional effort barrier, although small, made the Kisses a less attractive deal.</em></p>

Keeping easy, tempting foods in plain sight, such as an open bag of chips or bowl of candy, creates a situation that is simply too tempting for the parts of our brains that are constantly on the lookout for a good deal.</em></p>

<p><em>Subjective value quantifies how much each particular option will benefit the organism so different options can be compared on the same scale.78 “Value is the only way to compare goods that are incommensurable, or qualitatively different,” explains Padoa-Schioppa. Economists and psychologists have long known that people behave as if their decisions are guided by assigning subjective value to options, but only recently have neuroscientists begun to understand how the brain computes it. While Padoa-Schioppa’s monkeys make their choices, his team records the electrical activity of single neurons in a part of the brain called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The OFC is a region of the prefrontal cortex, which is the part of the brain most often associated with reasoning and judgment (see figure 24). Relative to the rest of the brain, the prefrontal cortex is large in primates and even bigger in humans. Padoa-Schioppa has discovered that the firing patterns of individual OFC neurons represent the value of specific options.79 For example, there are neurons that fire a little bit when a monkey is offered one drop of grape juice, and fire a lot when it’s offered four drops. Then there are other neurons that fire in response to unsweetened Kool-Aid. And, interestingly, there are even neurons that represent the choice the monkey has made—before its eyes move to the target. Padoa-Schioppa and other researchers have found that OFC neurons are able to integrate many kinds of cost-benefit information into their value computations, including the type of juice, its quantity, the probability of obtaining it, and the time and effort costs required to obtain it. Remarkably, the firing of these neurons seems to encode the complete subjective value of each option—in other words, each option’s overall value to the monkey. Studies in humans have also implicated the OFC in value computation, as well as a nearby brain region called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The activity of these neurons may in fact be responsible for how much we value a pastry and how much we value three dollars.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 107 (location ~ 1574-1590)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>First, the OFC uses incoming information from other brain regions to calculate the predicted value of each option.81 You independently compute the value of the pastry and the three dollars in your wallet. Second, the OFC sends those two independent bids to the basal ganglia, where the striatum compares them and selects the strongest one. You’re feeling very tempted by the seductive food cues behind the counter, and the three dollars isn’t worth much to you because you just got paid, so the pastry wins. Third, the basal ganglia return that selection to the OFC, and the decision is made. This activates a cascade of other competitions in cognitive and motor areas of the brain, which skillfully plan and generate the behaviors necessary to follow up on the decision (see figures 11 and 12). You reach into your wallet, pull out three dollars, trade them for the pastry, and dig in.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 108 (location ~ 1600-1607)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Yet OFC damage should reduce a person’s ability to make decisions in response to changing conditions, because this requires the brain to compute value on the fly. And that’s exactly what happens. This time, let’s imagine you’ve just flushed the toilet. For most people, this new information would immediately reduce the value of flushing a second time, and so you wouldn’t do it. Yet someone who has trouble computing value isn’t able to incorporate that new information into her decision, so chances are, she’ll flush again out of habit. And again, and again. This phenomenon, where a person keeps performing an action even after it’s no longer useful, is called perseveration, and it often results from OFC damage.82 One common and striking consequence of OFC damage is overeating and weight gain. At first glance, this might seem strange. Why would damage to a brain region that computes an abstract concept like value affect eating so much? The answer may lie in the brain’s inability to update the value of food as a meal progresses. When you sit down to a meal, that first bite of food usually has the highest value, because you’re hungry. As the meal progresses, you feel increasingly full, and the value of each additional bite goes down. Once the value of the next bite is lower than the value of doing something else, like clearing the table, you stop eating. This process requires your brain to continually update the changing value of the food on your plate—precisely what people with OFC damage are unable to do. For a person with OFC damage, every bite is as compelling as the first one, so they often overeat substantially. This may explain why they continue to eat even when they report feeling extremely full: the brain registers the feeling of fullness just fine, but that feeling doesn’t get translated into behavior because it doesn’t register in the OFC.</em></p>

<p><em>Dopamine seems to play a similar role in humans. Increasing dopamine levels using amphetamine makes people more willing to work for rewards, even if the reward is small or uncertain. Dopamine turns us into go-getters. This makes perfect sense when we think about what’s happening when the brain releases dopamine. Through repetition, your brain has learned to associate the sight, smell, sound, and other food cues with the reward of eating food. As soon as you see that bar of chocolate in the candy aisle, your dopamine level begins to spike. This burst of dopamine energizes you to grasp the chocolate and put it into your cart. If you had seen frozen green beans instead, you would have had a much smaller dopamine burst, proportional to the smaller reward, and you probably would have walked right past them. Dopamine tunes your motivation level to be proportional to the value of the reward you’re pursuing—and it does so beyond your conscious awareness.</em></p>

<p><em>Interestingly, a follow-up study showed that children who were better at delaying ended up slimmer thirty years later. In fact, for each additional minute they were able to delay eating the marshmallow as a child, they were slimmer by 0.2 BMI points as an adult. This means that a ten-minute difference in delay was associated with a fifteen-pound difference in adult weight. This makes sense: People who value their future selves highly will value long-term goals like leanness and health. For someone like this, two marshmallows fifteen minutes from now is worth nearly twice as much as one marshmallow right now, and a slimmer figure next summer may be worth more than a pastry right now. On the other hand, people who don’t value their future selves very much may find that one marshmallow right now is worth more than two marshmallows in fifteen minutes, and that a pastry right now is worth more than a slimmer figure next summer. Multiple studies have confirmed that people who steeply discount the value of future rewards are more likely to have obesity. They’re also more likely to be addicted to illegal drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes; more likely to gamble; and more likely to carry credit card debt.86 In essence, these are all examples of pursuing immediate rewards without much regard for future consequences.</em></p>

Our species evolved in a dangerous environment in which we had about a 50 percent chance of living to age thirty-five. If you aren’t certain you’ll be alive next year, it’s rational to value what’s happening right now more than what might happen next year. In the environment of our ancestors, it was advantageous to evolve brains that intuitively value our present selves more than our future selves.</em></p>

<p><em>To find out if the obesity produced by VMN lesions involved a hormone, Hervey lesioned the VMN of one parabiosed rat while leaving its twin intact. The results were striking: As expected, the VMN-lesioned rats became voracious and rapidly gained fat—yet unexpectedly, the nonlesioned twins lost interest in food, became emaciated, and often died of starvation.93 Upon autopsy, the bodies of VMN-lesioned animals were overflowing with fat, while remarkably, their intact twins contained no visible fat at all. For Hervey, the result suggested that a circulating factor was passing from the VMN-lesioned rat to its intact twin, suppressing the twin’s appetite and adiposity. Building on a hypothesis recently developed by Gordon Kennedy, Hervey proposed that fat tissue secretes a hormonal satiety factor whose blood levels reflect adiposity, such that the more fat tissue a person carries, the higher his level of the hormone. This hormone then travels through the bloodstream and acts in the satiety center of the brain to constrain appetite and adiposity (see figure 31). The idea is that when body fat levels increase, the satiety factor increases, and this suppresses appetite and reduces adiposity back to its initial level. Conversely, when body fat levels decrease, the satiety factor decreases, and this stimulates appetite and fat gain back up to its initial level. Together, Hervey hypothesized, the satiety factor and the VMN form a feedback system that regulates adiposity, working to keep it at a stable level. They named this fat-regulating system the lipostat, after the Greek words for “fat” and “stationary.”</em></p>

<p><em>In the early 1970s, at the Jackson Laboratory, a researcher named Doug Coleman set out to learn more about the mysterious obese mouse that had been identified there in 1949. He hypothesized that, like VMN-lesioned rats, obese mice have a defect in the lipostat system. Using parabiosis, Coleman joined obese mice with normal mice. In contrast to what Hervey had reported in his experiments with VMN-lesioned rats, the normal mice continued eating, and their weight remained stable. However, the obese twins underwent a remarkable transformation: Their appetite declined, they didn’t grow as fat, and their obesity-related metabolic disturbances improved.94 This led Coleman to conclude that obese mice lacked the elusive satiety factor and, therefore, that the satiety factor is encoded by the ob gene that is damaged in these mice. Joining them with normal mice had restored their damaged hormone, normalizing their appetite, body weight, and metabolism. Coleman published his findings in 1973, yet the identity of the ob gene remained shrouded in mystery. Coleman’s findings were a critical stepping-stone in the history of obesity research, because they gave us a defined entry point to unravel how the brain regulates appetite and body fatness. The ob mouse carries a mutation that inactivates the satiety factor hormone. If researchers could locate the gene, identify the hormone it produced, and discover how it works, they might be able to unlock the secrets of adiposity that had thus far eluded them.</em></p>

<p><em>One of the earliest and most influential studies was the Minnesota Starvation Experiment conducted by the prolific nutrition researcher Ancel Keys in the latter years of World War II. The goal was to understand the effects of starvation on the human body and mind. Over the course of six months of semistarvation, thirty-six young male conscientious objectors lost approximately one-quarter of their initial body weight. While this weight loss was no surprise, what happened after their food restriction was lifted is more interesting: Due primarily to a prodigious appetite, their body weights and adiposity rebounded rapidly. As they regained weight, their appetites normalized, and they eventually settled close to their original weights. It seemed as if a powerful internal control system was regulating their appetite and adiposity. The system seemed to work in the opposite direction as well, pushing back against short-term fat gain. Obesity researcher Ethan Sims tremendously overfed a group of lean prison inmates in the 1960s, causing their weight to increase by up to 25 percent over a four- to six-month period. Despite the fact that these men were not particularly overweight even after overfeeding, their bodies vigorously resisted the weight gain. Sims found that he had to feed his subjects up to 10,000 Calories per day to get them to sustain their weight gain—nearly four times what most adult men require.96 After the experiment was over, most of them hardly had any appetite for weeks afterward, and the majority slimmed back down to their former weights. This suggested, again, that an internal control system was regulating their appetite and body weight.</em></p>

<p><em>Leibel had the concept and the drive, but he didn’t have the technical skill. What he needed was a technical wizard who had mastered the rapidly evolving techniques of molecular biology.98 This man was Jeff Friedman, a bright and driven assistant professor at Rockefeller. In 1986, Leibel and Friedman initiated a collaboration to “clone” the ob gene—in other words, to identify its location in the genome and its DNA sequence. What followed was a grueling eight-year investigation, requiring more than four thousand mice and one hundred person-years of work. The result would shake obesity science to its foundation and eventually rebuild it into a more mature and sophisticated discipline. As Leibel and Friedman’s team narrowed in on the location of the ob gene, Friedman grew increasingly concerned that the more senior Leibel would receive the lion’s share of the credit for the gene’s discovery. Friedman insisted that Leibel stay out of the lab where the work was being conducted, although Leibel continued to play a guiding role in the project. On December 1, 1994, without Leibel’s knowledge, Friedman published the identity of the ob gene in the journal Nature. He reported that the gene codes for a small protein hormone that’s secreted by fat tissue and circulates in the blood. Friedman named this hormone leptin, after the Greek word leptos, meaning “thin.” Furthermore, he showed that humans carry an almost identical gene. The paper concludes, presciently: Identification of ob now offers an entry point into the pathways that regulate adiposity and body weight and should provide a fuller understanding of the [development] of obesity. The satiety factor had been identified. And obesity was on its way to becoming a biological problem. Leibel, and most of the other researchers who played key roles in the project, were excluded as authors on the paper. The day before the paper was published, Friedman had filed a patent for leptin. After a ferocious bidding war between pharmaceutical companies, that patent was sold to Amgen for a $20 million initial payment so it could develop leptin as the ultimate weight-loss drug.</em></p>

<p><em>Eventually, Farooqi and O’Rahilly were able to show that the children’s insatiable appetites and extraordinary obesity were caused by the omission of a single guanine nucleotide—one letter in the 3.2 billion-letter genetic code—that happened to inactivate the leptin gene. “That was really the first evidence that a defect in a single human gene could cause obesity,” explains Farooqi, “but also that a complete lack of leptin could cause obesity in humans.” At this point, Farooqi and O’Rahilly have worked extensively with leptin-deficient humans, who are extremely rare. “Usually, they are of normal birth weight,” says Farooqi, “and then they’re very, very hungry from the first weeks and months of life.” By age one, they have obesity. By age two, they weigh fifty-five to sixty-five pounds, and their obesity only accelerates from there. While a normal child may be about 25 percent fat, and a typical child with obesity may be 40 percent fat, leptin-deficient children are up to 60 percent fat. Farooqi explains that the primary reason leptin-deficient children develop obesity is that they have “an incredible drive to eat,” resulting in an exceptionally high intake of calories.100 In addition, the reward regions of their brains show an exaggerated response to images of calorie-dense, high-reward foods. Leptin-deficient children are nearly always hungry, and they almost always want to eat, even shortly after meals. Their appetite is so exaggerated that it’s almost impossible to put them on a diet: If their food is restricted, they find some way to eat, including retrieving stale morsels from the trash can and gnawing on fish sticks directly from the freezer. This is the desperation of starvation. Furthermore, leptin-deficient children have a powerful emotional and cognitive connection to food. “They really enjoy food,” explains Farooqi, “and if you provide them with food, they’re incredibly happy. It doesn’t matter what the food is.” Even the dreaded hospital cafeteria doesn’t faze them. Conversely, they become distressed if they’re out of sight of food, even briefly. If they don’t get food, they become combative, crying and demanding something to eat.</em></p>

<p><em>This phenomenon of starvation in the face of abundant body fat is a paradox with which Rudy Leibel and Jules Hirsch are very well acquainted. In 1984, they published a seminal paper showing that people with garden-variety obesity who then lose weight show evidence of a starvation response. Beginning with a group of twenty-six people with an average body weight of 336 pounds, Leibel and Hirsch slimmed them down to 220 pounds using a rigorous low-calorie diet. Although 116 pounds is an impressive amount of weight to lose, at the end of the weight-loss period, the volunteers were still considered to have obesity. Remarkably, after weight loss, the number of calories their bodies consumed was only about three-quarters of what it should have been based on their new, slimmer body size. What’s more, they were ravenously hungry. Something was shutting down their metabolic rate and ramping up their appetites—fighting their weight loss—even though they remained quite fat. Leibel and Hirsch have spent much of their careers following up on this puzzling finding. In further studies, they found that weight loss, both in people who are lean and obese, triggers a powerful suite of biological and psychological responses that work together to restore the lost fat. To do this, the brain curtails the activity of the sympathetic nervous system and reduces thyroid hormone levels, both of which slow the metabolic rate, accounting for the cold and sluggish feeling some people experience after weight loss. The brain cuts back the number of calories a muscle burns during a given contraction, reducing the calories expended in physical activity. And most important, the brain ramps up hunger and increases the response to food cues that signal high-calorie, high-reward foods. Before weight loss, you might have been able to stroll by the ice cream aisle without any problem, but after weight loss, the temptation to buy and eat ice cream can be overwhelming. In effect, substantial weight loss triggers a starvation response, whether a person is lean, overweight, or obese—and this response continues until the fat comes back.</em></p>

<p><em>Friedman’s analogy is an important lesson for people who think weight loss is as easy as deciding to eat less and exercise more. The brain was forged in the flames of highly competitive natural selection, and it doesn’t take weight loss lightly. “[The starvation response] is there for preservation,” says Leibel. “Evolutionarily, it has played a very important role in our survival.” Remarkably, Leibel and Hirsch found that this starvation response could be almost completely eliminated by injecting their volunteers with small doses of leptin, just enough to keep leptin levels where they were before weight loss. This shows that the drop in leptin that occurs with weight loss is the key signal that triggers the starvation response. Although this powerful self-preservation mechanism evolved to keep us alive and fertile, it often seems to backfire in the modern affluent world, where excess adiposity is a greater threat than starvation.</em></p>

<p><em>Fortunately for the leptin-deficient cousins, O’Rahilly and Farooqi obtained approval to treat them with injections of isolated leptin. The effect was immediate and dramatic. While before leptin treatment no amount of food was enough, within four days of treatment, they began turning down food. Their obsession with food subsided too, and their brain responses to tempting foods normalized. They lost much of their excess fat, and after a few years, they looked and acted similar to normal kids. This raises a $20 million question: Why aren’t we all taking leptin to lose weight? It turns out that people with garden-variety obesity—as opposed to obesity caused by a rare genetic mutation—already have high levels of leptin. And researchers have found that leptin isn’t the miraculous obesity cure the pharmaceutical industry hoped it would be. While leptin therapy does cause some amount of fat loss, it requires enormous doses to be effective (up to forty times the normal circulating amount). Also troubling is the extremely variable response, with some people losing over thirty pounds and others losing little or no weight. This is a far cry from the powerful fat-busting effect of leptin in rodents. The new miracle weight-loss drug never made it to market.</em></p>

<p><em>What are the implications for us? The first is that once a person develops obesity, it becomes a self-sustaining state, and the person has to overeat to feel the same satisfaction that a lean person feels after eating a smaller meal. In essence, once we gain weight, the lipostat becomes one of the primary reasons why we continue to overeat, undermining our conscious desire to be lean and healthy. A second key implication is that weight loss is hard because it requires us to fight deeply wired impulses. Long-term diet trials suggest that the hypothalamus is remarkably good at undermining fat-loss efforts. Weight regain afflicts all the most popular diet styles, including portion control, low-fat diets, and low-carbohydrate diets. One of the best examples of this comes from the hit TV series The Biggest Loser. On this reality show, contestants with obesity adopt an extreme diet and exercise regimen, and the person who loses the highest percentage of her starting weight at the end of the season wins a cash prize of $250,000. Many contestants lose over 100 pounds of body weight, including Ali Vincent. In 2008, Vincent dropped 112 pounds, securing a win in the show’s fifth season. Yet since her nadir of 122 pounds, she has regained most of the weight. “I feel like a failure,” says Vincent, understandably frustrated by gradually losing the war of attrition against her hypothalamus. Her experience is by no means unique. Suzanne Mendonca, who lost 90 pounds in the show’s second season in 2005, quipped, “NBC never does a reunion. Why? Because we’re all fat again.”</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Leibel’s and Hirsch’s weight-loss studies lend scientific rigor to a common-sense conclusion: Different people defend different adiposity set points. In lean people, the lipostat defends a low-adiposity set point against fat loss, which makes great sense from an evolutionary standpoint—a lean person can’t afford to lose much fat. Yet what makes less sense is that among people with obesity, the lipostat defends a high-adiposity set point. Somehow, the hypothalamus has “decided” to defend an obese body type rather than a lean one, even though a person with obesity carries much more fat than is necessary to avoid starvation and infertility. In fact, it makes even less sense than that, because excess adiposity is one of the leading causes of infertility and premature death in the affluent world.</em></p>

<p><em>Many researchers, including myself, speculate that the lipostat behaves abnormally because it’s been placed in an unfamiliar situation: The hypothalamus is wired to keep us healthy and fertile in an environment that disappeared long ago. In today’s environment of plentiful, tasty, refined, calorie-dense food, low physical activity requirements, and other unnatural characteristics, the lipostat essentially misfires, driving many of us inexorably to overeat and gain weight. Yet others seem to remain lean no matter what they do—a topic we’ll return to in the next chapter.</em></p>

<p><em>In 2000, Barry Levin, an obesity and diabetes researcher at Rutgers University, published a paper clearly demonstrating this effect in rats. Starting with a genetically diverse strain of rats, he fed them either ordinary rat pellets or a high-calorie palatable diet. On the palatable diet, some of the rats gained weight and fat, while others didn’t. Levin’s team took the rats that had gained weight and restricted their food intake while keeping them on the palatable diet, which caused them to lose weight and fat. So far this is what you might expect, but what they found next is more interesting: When they lifted the calorie restriction, allowing the animals to eat as much as they wanted again, the rats didn’t just resume their gradual upward trajectory of weight gain—they quickly bounced back up to the weight of rats that had been eating an unrestricted palatable diet and gaining weight the entire time. Levin’s findings suggest that there is a certain weight that the lipostat “wants” an animal to maintain, defending it against changes, and that this weight depends both on genetics and on the specific diet the animal is eating. Levin’s team went further, testing the effects of rotating an obesity-susceptible strain of rats between three different diets. The first diet was ordinary rat pellets, the second diet was the same palatable diet as the previous experiment, and the third diet was a highly palatable milkshake-like meal-replacement beverage called Ensure105 (specifically, the chocolate flavor). As expected, the rats began overeating and gaining weight and fat on the palatable diets. In fact, the rats eating Ensure almost doubled in weight over ten weeks—an impressive feat.</em></p>

<p><em>High-reward foods tend to increase food intake and adiposity, while lower-reward foods tend to have the opposite effect. This suggests a weight management “secret” you’ll rarely find in a diet book: eat simple food. The reason you’ll rarely find it in a diet book is that, by definition, lower-reward food is not very motivating. It doesn’t get us excited about a diet, and it doesn’t make books fly off the shelves. We want to hear that we can lose weight while eating the most delicious food of our lives, and the weight-loss industry is happy to indulge us. The truth is that there are many ways to lose weight, but all else being equal, a diet that’s lower in reward value will control appetite and reduce adiposity more effectively than one that’s high in reward value. The trick, as with all diets, is sticking with it, because just as the set point can go down, it can go right back up if you return to your former eating habits. And that means designing an eating plan you can live with for the long haul. For most people, a “bland liquid diet” like those I described isn’t a viable long-term solution, but keeping added fats, sugars, salt, and calorie-dense highly rewarding foods to a modest level may be.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 142 (location ~ 2101-2110)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We do, however, have enough information to arrive at some practical conclusions. First, calorie-dense, highly rewarding food may favor overeating and weight gain not just because we passively overeat it but also because it turns up the set point of the lipostat. This may be one reason why regularly eating junk food seems to be a fast track to obesity in both animals and humans. Second, focusing the diet on less rewarding foods may make it easier to lose weight and maintain weight loss because the lipostat doesn’t fight it as vigorously. This may be part of the explanation for why all weight-loss diets seem to work to some extent—even those that are based on diametrically opposed principles, such as low-fat, low-carbohydrate, Paleo, and vegan diets. Because each diet excludes major reward factors, they may all lower the adiposity set point somewhat.</em></p>

<p><em>Presumably, this reflects the effects of exercise on the lipostat, as suggested by Levin’s studies in rats. On one hand, exercise depletes the body’s fat reserves and therefore triggers the lipostat to increase appetite. On the other hand, exercise may lower the adiposity set point among people who carry excess fat, reducing appetite and facilitating fat loss. The strength of each of these opposing forces, which varies from person to person, determines the net change in appetite in response to exercise. So while exercise can cause substantial fat loss, it works better for some people than others. Another fact that’s often overlooked is the difference between weight loss and fat loss. When someone tries to slim down, the goal is not usually to lose weight—it’s specifically to lose fat. It turns out that exercise helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. Although slow progress on the scale may be frustrating, changes in the mirror and in health as a result of exercise can be better than what the scale suggests.</em></p>

<p><em>Low-carbohydrate dieting is one of the most popular ways to lose weight, and numerous studies suggest that although it’s no miracle obesity cure, it is more effective than a traditional low-fat portion-controlled diet over periods of about a year. This is actually a big deal, because it’s a major reversal of the view that’s prevailed for most of the last half century, which is that fat is fattening, and the best way to lose weight is to cut back on fat. In fact, many people report that low-carbohydrate diets help them curb their appetite and cravings, and the research backs this up. When people go on a low-carbohydrate diet, their spontaneous calorie intake drops substantially—even though they usually aren’t making any deliberate effort to eat fewer calories. Why? As you may have noticed, this effect looks a whole lot like what happens when the adiposity set point goes down. If we take a closer look at the diets of people who eat a low-carbohydrate diet, what we see is that when they reduce their carbohydrate intake, the proportion of protein in the diet tends to go up. As it turns out, amino acids, the building blocks of protein, act directly in the hypothalamus, influencing the lipostat system. Although most of the direct evidence comes from rodent studies, a substantial amount of indirect evidence suggests that a high intake of protein may be able to lower the adiposity set point in humans too.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 146 (location ~ 2160-2170)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>A 2005 study by University of Washington researcher Scott Weigle and colleagues illustrates just how striking this effect can be. Weigle’s team started by determining the habitual calorie intake of a group of nineteen volunteers, after which the researchers fed them a high-protein diet (30 percent of calories) for twelve weeks under tightly controlled conditions. On the high-protein diet, the volunteers’ calorie intake spontaneously declined by an average of 441 Calories per day, and their weight dropped by nearly eleven pounds—despite the fact that it wasn’t a weight-loss study and no one had asked them to eat less. As expected, their leptin levels declined as they lost weight—yet the starvation response never seemed to kick in. The effect can’t be attributed to reducing carbohydrate intake, because Weigle’s team increased protein at the expense of fat, not carbohydrate. Adding to the case is the work of Maastricht University researchers Klaas Westerterp and Margriet Westerterp-Plantenga, which supports the idea that high-protein diets attenuate the starvation response that typically undermines weight loss. Their studies show that people who lose weight by eating a high-protein diet experience less hunger than those who lose weight by other means, and extra protein also largely prevents the reduction of energy expenditure that often accompanies dieting. Consistent with this, their findings demonstrate that restricting carbohydrate without increasing protein doesn’t cause the same weight-loss effect as a typical higher-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, suggesting that carbohydrate restriction per se isn’t actually the key ingredient in low-carbohydrate diets.109 Rather, advice to eat a low-carbohydrate diet may be effective simply because it’s an easy way to get people to eat high-protein foods and reduce major food reward culprits.</em></p>

<p><em>What followed was a virtual avalanche of data from Schwartz, Porte, Woods, Woods’s new postdoc Randy Seeley, and several other competing groups. Shortly after the NPY study, Schwartz published a paper showing that the hypothalamus, and particularly the arcuate nucleus, contains high levels of the receptor for leptin. Even more tantalizing was the accumulating evidence that another group of proteins, called melanocortins, play the opposite role of NPY in the brain: When injected into the brains of rodents, melanocortins powerfully suppressed food intake.111 Like NPY, melanocortins are located in distinct neurons of the arcuate nucleus, which were named POMC neurons, after the POMC protein that is the precursor of melanocortins. Schwartz’s group showed that melanocortin levels are also regulated by leptin—yet in the opposite direction of NPY. NPY and melanocortins are key cellular pathways by which leptin regulates food intake and adiposity via the brain. What emerged from these studies was a remarkably logical explanation for how leptin regulates the lipostat: It turns off neurons that drive eating, and it turns on neurons that inhibit eating. And, by implication, when leptin levels decline, neurons that drive eating turn on and neurons that inhibit eating turn off, increasing the drive to eat. This “push-pull” system is redundant and extremely robust, and only disrupting major nodes in the signaling pathway can derail it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 151 (location ~ 2230-2241)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Schwartz’s basic explanation for how leptin works has withstood the test of time, and NPY and POMC neurons have remained at the center of the story, although we now know a lot more about how the system operates. For example, NPY neurons in the arcuate nucleus don’t just secrete NPY; they secrete at least two other substances that stimulate feeding.112 Because of this synergy of appetite-stimulating substances, released in just the right downstream brain regions, NPY neurons are the most powerful driver of eating known to science. If there is such thing as a “hunger neuron” that drives pure, visceral hunger, the NPY neuron is it.113 Scott Sternson, a neuroscience researcher at the National Institutes of Health’s Janelia research campus, knows this well. His group was the first to specifically stimulate NPY neurons in awake, normally behaving mice.114 When they turn on NPY neurons, mice eat. A lot. I’ve replicated this experiment myself, and it’s quite impressive. With the flick of a switch, a mouse will stuff its face with whatever food is around—eating up to ten times what it would normally eat in the same period of time. Furthermore, Sternson’s work shows that the way NPY neurons compel a mouse to seek food is by making the mouse feel bad until it eats.115 Like humans, mice don’t like to feel hungry, and relieving that hunger state by eating—or, in Sternson’s case, by turning off NPY neurons directly—is itself a reward. If we tie this together with what we covered in chapter 3, it becomes clear that eating motivates us in two distinct ways that reinforce one another: Unpleasant hunger neurons get turned off, and food reward neurons get turned on.</em></p>

<p><em>Richard Palmiter, the University of Washington researcher who keeps popping up in this book, has a neat trick up his sleeve: He can destroy almost any neuron population in the brain with pinpoint accuracy, without harming nearby neurons.116 When he uses this trick to destroy NPY neurons in obese mice, their appetites normalize, they lose weight, and ultimately, they become difficult to distinguish from normal mice. “The major symptoms are all corrected,” explains Palmiter. What this suggests is that the primary reason obese animals overeat and become tremendously fat is that their NPY neurons are in constant overdrive because there isn’t any leptin around to keep them in check. Get rid of the NPY neurons, and the animals slim down, even without a trace of leptin. This has a second, even more remarkable implication: The hunger, the obsession with food—many of the physiological and psychological effects that we see in people who are dieting, starving, or born without leptin—could be largely due to a population of hyperactive NPY neurons that is small enough to fit on the head of a pin.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 153 (location ~ 2261-2270)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As far as we currently know, NPY and POMC neurons are the most important convergence points between the adiposity-regulating inputs and outputs of the brain, and as such, they have attracted a disproportionate amount of attention from the scientific community. Many researchers, including Sternson, Palmiter, and Brad Lowell, a neuroscience researcher at Harvard Medical School, are working on deciphering the inputs and outputs of these neurons—and they are making remarkable progress. “The ability to identify individual neurons and then use this technology to do circuit mapping,” says Schwartz, “is ultimately going to take the field to the next level.”</em></p>

<p><em>In many ways, we’ve already reached the next level Schwartz is referring to. In fact, we’ve cured obesity countless times—in rodents. We now have the ability to take genes from almost any species, manipulate them to make them do what we want, insert them into the mouse genome so that they are expressed in specific cell populations of the brain, and use them to influence food intake, adiposity, and many other things. We can precisely activate, silence, or even kill specific populations of neurons in the mouse brain, controlling appetite and adiposity as if the mouse were a marionette. Modern neuroscience has achieved feats that would have seemed like science fiction to researchers only a few decades ago. We know from the work of Mohr, Leibel, Friedman, O’Rahilly, Farooqi, and many others that the brain circuits that regulate eating and adiposity in humans have much in common with those of rodents. With time, we could undoubtedly adapt the techniques I described for use in ourselves. So what’s holding us back from curing human obesity? In a word, ethics. While we already have the technical ability to genetically engineer humans, and probably directly manipulate the brain circuits that control eating, we don’t currently consider it ethical. And there are many good reasons for this, one of which is that we haven’t yet demonstrated the safety of this technology.</em></p>

<p><em>Astrocytes in the hypothalami of obese rats and mice were enlarged, and their filaments were tangled together in a thick mat. Microglia had also enlarged and multiplied. Both changes were specifically located in the same area as NPY and POMC neurons (the arcuate nucleus), but not elsewhere. Our results suggest that obese rodents suffer from a mild form of brain injury in an area of the brain that’s critical for regulating food intake and adiposity. Not only that, but the injury response and inflammation that developed when animals were placed on a fattening diet preceded the development of obesity, suggesting that this brain injury could have played a role in the fattening process.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 159 (location ~ 2345-2350)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>One of the conditions doctors use MRI to diagnose is brain damage resulting from a past injury, such as stroke or physical trauma. This is because when the brain is injured, astrocytes go into overdrive to support the healing process, and they eventually form a scar that is visible on an MRI scan for a long time after the injury. This is analogous to how your skin grows scar tissue as it heals a cut. Although we weren’t expecting to see stroke-like changes in the hypothalami of people with obesity, we thought it was worth looking for a subtler version of the same scarring—similar to what we found in rats and mice. And that’s exactly what we saw. Schur’s analysis showed that the more signs of damage we found in a person’s hypothalamus, the more likely he was to have obesity. What’s more, this effect was once again located in the part of the hypothalamus that harbors NPY and POMC neurons. “The scariest implication,” explains Schur, “is that the food we eat may cause damage in areas of the brain that we need to regulate our body weight and our appetite, as well as our blood sugar and, to some degree, our reproductive health.”</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>what we can conclude is that the hypothalamus is under duress in obesity and that this is likely caused (at least in part) by the unhealthy food we eat. In response to this challenge, the hypothalamus activates a broad swath of cellular stress response pathways, and some of these have the potential to dampen leptin signaling and contribute to the fattening process.122 This likely operates in parallel with the set-point-altering effects of food reward and protein intake we encountered in the last chapter. Brain damage is a daunting term, and it may make the situation seem hopeless for people who would like to lose weight. Yet our research also suggests that the process is reversible—at least in mice. When we switch mice off a fattening diet and back on to a strict healthy diet, even without restricting their calorie intake, they lose their excess fat, and their astrocytes and microglia go back to normal. This is true even if they’ve been obese for a long time. We still don’t know if the same is true for humans, but there is reason to hope.</em></p>

<p><em>Personally, I believe overeating itself probably plays an important role in the process that increases the adiposity set point. In other words, repeated bouts of overeating don’t just make us fat; they make our bodies want to stay fat. This is consistent with the simple observation that in the United States, most of our annual weight gain occurs during the six-week holiday feasting period between Thanksgiving and the new year, and that this extra weight tends to stick with us after the holidays are over. Thanksgiving dinner is the definition of overeating, and Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Eve aren’t far behind. Throughout that entire period, well-meaning family and friends inundate us with cookies, pies, and other tempting calorie-rich treats that tend to hang around the kitchen until we eat them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 162 (location ~ 2390-2396)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Let’s recap what I’ve proposed thus far. We overeat because we’re surrounded by seductive, calorie-dense food that’s a great deal. The food’s high reward value increases the set point of the lipostat, though not necessarily permanently, and this further facilitates overeating. At the same time, overeating itself spikes leptin levels and injures the hypothalamus by a mechanism we have yet to nail down (likely involving diet quality in addition to quantity). These two simultaneous hits cause the hypothalamus to lose sensitivity to the leptin hormone, meaning that it requires more leptin, and therefore more body fat, to hold off the starvation response that drives us to overeat. This time, the increase in your set point is permanent, or at least difficult to reverse. The lower limit of your comfortable weight creeps up.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 163 (location ~ 2408-2414)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>My fMRI results are consistent with what Schur’s studies have shown. When people are hungry, their brains react strongly to calorie-dense foods.125 However, after they eat, this reaction to food cues subsides. Schur explains: “At the end of a meal, what you’re really experiencing is the fact that food doesn’t look good to you anymore. The taste of it isn’t as good as it used to be; you look at your plate and say, ‘Ugh, I don’t want any more of that.’” As a meal progresses, something in the brain receives information about what we’ve eaten and shuts down the circuits that make us want more food. How does this work, and can we exploit it to help curb our tendency to overeat?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 167 (location ~ 2465-2471)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ultimately, the size of your meals has a major impact on your total calorie intake, and whether or not you gain weight over time. This is partially determined by how your brain stem generates satiety as you eat, eventually causing you to lose interest in food. Yet we know the hypothalamus impacts adiposity in large part by modifying food intake. How does this work? The hypothalamus influences brain stem satiety circuits in response to long-term changes in adiposity. In other words, if you’re dieting and you’ve lost fat, the hypothalamus ensures that it takes more food to feel full at a meal than it did before you lost fat. Your brain dampens the feeling of satiety so you won’t feel satisfied until you’ve eaten enough calories to start regaining fat. This is why people who are dieting often seem to have a bottomless appetite and never feel full. Conversely, if you’ve overeaten and gained fat, your brain enhances the feeling of satiety so your meals will be smaller for a while. This is how we think the hypothalamus and brain stem work together to regulate appetite and adiposity. Since the hypothalamus influences brain stem satiety circuits, any impairment of the leptin system should increase the amount of food it takes a person to reach satiety. This is exactly what researchers have found in people with obesity, consistent with the idea that their brains are leptin resistant. When a person with obesity eats food, it doesn’t suppress her brain’s response to food cues as much as it does in a lean person. The brain regions that govern hunger and motivation just keep firing, driving her to overeat. This might seem grim, but there are ways to mitigate it.</em></p>

<p><em>Holt’s results go a long way toward explaining why both rats and humans overeat spectacularly on a cafeteria diet, and why we overeat without intending to in our daily lives. The nonconscious parts of the brain that regulate satiety, including the NTS, respond to specific food properties, such as food volume, protein, fiber, and palatability. Many of our modern processed foods have properties that don’t stimulate satiety circuits to the same degree as traditional whole foods. These foods, such as pizza, ice cream, cake, soda, and potato chips, invariably boast a combination of properties that make them less filling per calorie. Since most people use the sensation of satiety as a signal to stop eating, these foods allow us to blow past the point where we’ve had enough to satisfy our calorie needs—yet we don’t even realize we’re overeating because we don’t feel any fuller at the end of the meal.</em></p>

<p><em>EATING FOR SATIETY If your goal is to eat fewer calories without going hungry, high-satiety foods will help. These are items that have some combination of low calorie density, moderate palatability, high protein, and/or high fiber, such as beans, lentils, fresh fruit, vegetables, potatoes and sweet potatoes, fresh meat and seafood, oatmeal, avocados, yogurt, and eggs. The exceptionally high satiety value of potatoes is undoubtedly one of the reasons why the “potato diet” we encountered in chapter 3 is effective. But if you cover your potato with calorie-dense flavorings such as butter and cheese, or deep-fry it into french fries, all bets are off.</em></p>

<p><em>Since Börjeson’s study, many others have confirmed that genes have an outsized influence on adiposity. In fact, in modern affluent nations like the United States, genetic differences account for about 70 percent of the difference in body weight between individuals. They also play a prominent role in many of the details of our eating behavior, such as how much food we eat at a sitting, how responsive we are to the sensation of fullness, and how much impact food reward has on our food intake. In other words, whether a person is lean or fat in today’s world has less to do with willpower and gluttony and more to do with genetic roulette.129 If you want to be lean, the most effective strategy is to choose your parents wisely.</em></p>

<p><em>The research of James Levine, an endocrinologist who works with the Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University in Scottsdale, Arizona, explains this puzzling phenomenon. In a carefully controlled overfeeding study, his team showed that the primary reason some people readily burn off excess calories is that they ramp up a form of calorie burning called “non-exercise activity thermogenesis” (NEAT). NEAT is basically a fancy term for fidgeting. When certain people overeat, their brains boost calorie expenditure by making them fidget, change posture frequently, and make other small movements throughout the day. It’s an involuntary process, and Levine’s data show that it can incinerate nearly 700 Calories per day! The “most gifted” of Levine’s subjects gained less than a pound of body fat from eating 1,000 extra Calories per day for eight weeks. Yet the strength of the response was highly variable, and the “least gifted” of Levine’s subjects didn’t increase NEAT at all, shunting all the excess calories into fat tissue and gaining over nine pounds of body fat. For Levine, the study highlighted the importance of light physical activity throughout the day, which inspired him to invent the treadmill desk.</em></p>

<p><em>Stephen O’Rahilly and Sadaf Farooqi haven’t been twiddling their thumbs since they identified humans who lack leptin; in the meantime, they’ve located a number of other single-gene mutations that cause severe obesity. As it turns out, nearly all of them are in the leptin signaling pathway. These genes disrupt either leptin itself, the leptin receptor, or downstream signals that mediate leptin’s actions in the brain. What’s more, now that researchers have identified the genes responsible for fattening our various rodent models of single-gene obesity, they’ve found that these genes are in the leptin signaling pathway as well. It’s not every day in science that results from several related fields of research converge in such a powerful way. In this case, they all say in chorus: Leptin signaling in the brain is a key component of the biological control of adiposity.</em></p>

<p><em>Most researchers think destructive single-gene mutations only account for a small fraction of overeating and obesity. Yet at the same time, we know that genetics explains much of the differences in eating behavior, and most of the differences in adiposity, between individuals. Where are the missing genes? To answer this question, we have to turn to another type of genetics research that studies common gene variation rather than rare, catastrophic mutations that disrupt entire signaling pathways.</em></p>

<p><em>Remarkably, it turns out that a boatload of genes influence adiposity in humans, but each individual gene only has a small impact. So far, researchers have identified nearly one hundred genes that influence adiposity—yet together, these genes explain less than 3 percent of the differences in adiposity between people. Clearly, there’s still work to do. However, by looking at the genes that have been identified so far (which were identified precisely because they’re the most influential), we can gain unbiased insights into the biological processes that underlie garden-variety obesity.131 By now, you should have a pretty good guess what organ these genes tend to influence: the brain.</em></p>

<p><em>Well, I suppose that’s that: If you have fat genes, you’re destined to be fat. Or are you? A century ago in the United States, people carried the same genes we do today, yet few people had obesity. What has changed isn’t our genes, it’s our environment—our food, our cars, our jobs. This leads us to a critical conclusion about obesity genes: In most cases, they don’t actually make us fat, they simply make us susceptible to a fattening environment. In the absence of a fattening environment, they rarely cause obesity. As Francis Collins, geneticist and director of the National Institutes of Health, is fond of saying, “Genetics loads the gun, and environment pulls the trigger.” Unless you have a faulty gun, which is rare, if you don’t pull the trigger, it doesn’t discharge. A few lucky people are so genetically resistant to obesity that they’re unlikely to develop it under any circumstances. A few others are so genetically susceptible that they may carry excess fat even in a very healthy environment. For the rest us, the environment in which we find ourselves has a major impact on our weight.</em></p>

<p><em>The goal of this intensive study was to understand the impact of sleep restriction on food intake and brain activity, a topic that has captured the attention of many researchers in recent years—and which may help explain why we overeat in the modern world. On the fifth day of St-Onge’s study, the volunteers were turned loose upon the world and allowed to eat whatever they wanted for a day. The only catch was that they had to let the research team weigh and record everything they chose. At the end of the study, St-Onge and her colleagues analyzed the data and came to a striking conclusion: Their volunteers ate nearly 300 more Calories per day when they were sleep-deprived than when they were well-rested. “In our experience,” explains St-Onge, “sleep restriction increases food intake. It’s as simple as that.”</em></p>

<p><em>To understand how sleep restriction causes us to overeat—and what we can do about it—we first need to understand the biological basis of sleep. The story begins in 1916, when the Viennese neurologist Constantin von Economo began seeing patients with a previously unknown brain disorder. People afflicted with the disorder would sleep excessively—up to twenty hours per day—scarcely leaving time for other activities. Encephalitis lethargica, as von Economo named the disorder, swept through Europe and North America in the early twentieth century, afflicting as many as one million people. Most patients were left either dead or permanently disabled by the brain damage it caused. By 1928, the disease vanished as suddenly as it had appeared, and few cases have been reported since. To this day, we still aren’t sure what caused it, although many believe it was triggered by an infectious agent.</em></p>

<p><em>Since sleep and wakefulness are stable states, there has to be a signal that’s strong enough to kick one state into the other, or else we’d never fall asleep or wake up. We know that when we sleep too little, do hard physical or mental work, or stay up longer than usual, we feel sleepy and we’re more likely to doze off. This suggests that some sort of sleep-inducing signal accumulates in the brain, and the longer we’re awake, the harder we work, the more it builds up. We now have strong evidence that a chemical called adenosine is that signal. Adenosine builds up in the brain while we’re awake, and it builds up even faster when we exert ourselves. As it accumulates, it begins to inhibit the arousal system and activate the VLPO. Eventually, when adenosine builds up sufficiently, it triggers the flip-flop switch, and we fall asleep. During sleep, the brain clears excess adenosine, restoring our wakefulness by morning. Caffeine works by blocking adenosine’s actions.</em></p>

<p><em>The fundamental importance of sleep is highlighted by the fact that all animals with a nervous system sleep, or at least enter sleeplike states. Saper explains that “every species that we’ve looked at, even going back to simple invertebrates like sea slugs, tend to have rest-activity cycles.” He believes animals need sleep because neurons require periods of rest for the biochemical processes that support learning. The restorative processes that happen during sleep are extremely important for the optimal functioning of the brain, and interfering with them leads inevitably to degraded performance of numerous brain functions—and worse. David Dinges, a sleep researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, has spent much of his career studying the effects of sleep restriction on brain function. In one particularly telling study, Dinges’s team assigned volunteers to eight hours, six hours, or four hours in bed per night, for two weeks. Every two hours of waking time throughout the study, volunteers had to complete a battery of tests designed to measure various aspects of cognitive performance, including reaction time, attention, working memory, and basic arithmetic abilities. Their conclusion should serve as a caution to people who think sleep is a waste of time: “Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 186 (location ~ 2747-2757)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In other words, by a variety of measures, people who slept four or six hours per night showed substantially worse cognitive performance than people who slept eight hours per night. What’s more, these deficits grew with each additional night of short sleep. Importantly, volunteers felt sleepier for the first few days of sleep restriction, but after that, “subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits.” This suggests that people who short themselves on sleep may not even be aware of how poorly they’re performing.</em></p>

<p><em>Returning to St-Onge’s experiment from the beginning of the chapter, her team didn’t stop at measuring food intake in her sleep-restricted volunteers. They also performed fMRI to see how sleep restriction affects the brain’s response to food cues. The results of these brain scans suggest that sleep restriction increases the brain’s responsiveness to food—particularly calorie-dense junk food like pizza and doughnuts. The parts of the brain associated with food reward, including the ventral striatum, were more active in sleep-restricted volunteers, perhaps explaining why they ate more. Interestingly, the pattern of brain activity St-Onge observed in her sleep-restricted volunteers is quite similar to the pattern Rudy Leibel observed in the brains of people who had previously lost weight—and also the pattern Ellen Schur observed in my own brain when I was looking at food images in a hungry state. This suggests that lack of sleep doesn’t just impair our cognitive functions; it may also impair the lipostat that senses the body’s energy status and sets our motivation for food.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 187 (location ~ 2768-2776)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>An aside: Astute readers may note that when you sleep less, it also increases your calorie expenditure, because your metabolic rate is higher during wakefulness than during sleep. St-Onge and her team have shown that limiting sleep to four hours a night does indeed increase calorie expenditure, but only by about 100 Calories per day. Since her sleep-deprived volunteers ate nearly 300 excess Calories daily, that still leaves 200 Calories to accumulate around their midsections at the end of the day—enough to turn a susceptible person overweight over time. Time for another reality check: Although many studies have shown that sleep restriction increases the brain’s response to food, increases calorie intake, and sometimes increases body weight, these studies haven’t lasted longer than two weeks. To get an idea of whether this effect persists over the long term and results in gradual weight gain, we must turn to long-term observational studies that measure habitual sleep duration and see how it correlates with weight changes over time. At this point, researchers have conducted many such studies, and they overwhelmingly show that adults who sleep six or fewer hours per night do tend to gain more weight over time than those who sleep seven to nine hours per night.136 It’s also worth noting that the association between short sleep and weight gain is particularly strong in children. Although these studies by themselves can’t establish a cause-and-effect relationship between sleep duration and weight gain, when considered alongside the controlled studies we’ve just discussed, they make quite a compelling case that part of the reason why we eat too much and gain weight is that we don’t sleep enough. This conclusion has disturbing implications for those of us who live in affluent, modern societies, because many of us don’t get enough sleep. Twenty-nine percent of American adults get six hours of sleep or fewer per night, up from 22 percent in 1985. Researchers have reported similar trends among adolescents. Short sleepers are not only more likely to have obesity than people who sleep more; they’re also more likely to develop chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and more likely to die overall.</em></p>

<p><em>HOW MUCH SLEEP DO YOU NEED? Different people need different amounts of sleep to feel rested. Although this remains to be tested scientifically, it’s possible that naturally short sleepers get the same amount of benefit in, say, six hours, that long sleepers get in nine hours. If true, this would suggest that what harms us isn’t necessarily short sleep itself, but rather sleeping less than each of us needs as an individual. For example, a person who sleeps six hours per night but feels fully rested when she wakes up may not have anything to gain from attempting to sleep more, while another person who sleeps six hours per night but wakes up feeling miserable may benefit from more shut-eye. For now, the best advice is probably to sleep as much as you need to feel fully restored, rather than following rigid sleep guidelines that are based on averages from population studies.</em></p>

<p><em>Sleep loss also favors overeating by affecting how we perceive risks and rewards. In 2011, Duke sleep researcher Michael Chee published a paper suggesting that sleep loss has far-reaching impacts on our economic decision-making behavior. Chee and his team had twenty-nine young adult volunteers either sleep normally or skip one night of sleep, and then he asked them to perform a series of experimental gambling sessions while lying in an fMRI machine. Chee’s results showed that pulling an all-nighter causes people to become less concerned about potential losses and more attracted to potential gains—basically, they become risk takers. Furthermore, this effect correlated with measurable differences in brain activity. People who hadn’t slept showed greater activation of reward-related regions of the brain such as the ventral striatum in response to gambling gains, while also showing diminished brain responses to losses.</em></p>

<p><em>To test his hypothesis, Pardi’s team recruited fifty volunteers who believed they had signed up for a study on how sleep loss affects cognitive function. They were divided into seven groups, and each group was told to spend a different amount of time in bed the night preceding the experiment. These prescribed sleep times ranged from 60 to 130 percent of each person’s usual time in bed. (A key advantage of Pardi’s study is that it modeled a realistic range of sleep times that we commonly see in the general population, as opposed to many other sleep restriction studies, which allowed subjects as little as four hours of sleep, or none at all.) Seven days before the change in sleep time, Pardi’s team gave each person a battery of tests to assess their typical level of alertness and feelings of sleepiness. On the day following the change in sleep time, they repeated the same tests. Yet Pardi had a trick up his sleeve, on which the whole experiment hinged. While the volunteers took a break between tests, he had them watch two forty-minute movies that were unrelated to food. And during that time, Pardi put out bowls of foods like gummy bears, toffee peanuts, apple rings, and almonds that the volunteers could graze on. Pardi’s team covertly measured each person’s food intake by weighing the bowls before and after the movie break. At the end of the study, volunteers filled out a questionnaire rating how much they liked each food and how healthy they thought each item was. Consistent with St-Onge’s findings, sleepier participants munched more calories during the movie break. Yet they weren’t just more likely to eat food in general—they were specifically more likely to eat food they themselves rated as both delicious and unhealthy. Just as Chee’s results had predicted, Pardi’s sleep-deprived volunteers seemed to be more compelled by the immediate reward of eating tempting foods than by the long-term costs. “When you have inadequate sleep,” explains Pardi, “you’re probably less likely to live in accordance with your own health goals. You’re less likely to get into bed on time, you’re less likely to go to the gym, and you’re less likely to have your eating behaviors align with your long-term health goals.” fMRI research supports Pardi’s interpretation, showing that one night of total sleep deprivation reduces the food cue responsiveness of brain regions that support planning, reasoning, and long-term goals, while at the same time enhancing the responsiveness of brain regions that drive food reward. Together, this suggests that when you don’t sleep enough, you’re a prisoner of your own impulses—and those impulses will tell most of us to overeat unhealthy food.</em></p>

<p><em>Your body’s thirty-seven trillion cellular clocks are all kept more or less in synchrony by a master clock residing in a part of the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). If we think of the cellular clocks in the body as a giant orchestra, the SCN is the conductor.137 The master clock, in turn, takes its cues from the retina, the light-sensitive film of cells in the back of the eye, which detects the day-night cycle of the sun (see figure 43). But due to the characteristics of the retinal cells that transmit this information, the SCN only responds to blue light, which happens to be most abundant at midday. The SCN master clock uses its connections to other brain regions to set all the other clocks in the body. One of these connections is to the pineal gland, which secretes the sleep hormone melatonin. Melatonin levels increase at night, and this is an important signal that helps synchronize the body’s clocks by telling them when the sun has set. Connections from the SCN to other brain regions—including the arousal system and the VLPO sleep center—influence the circadian rhythms of sleep, physical activity, metabolism, and eating.138 These connections explain why we tend to sleep at night and not during the day.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 194 (location ~ 2871-2881)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>the SCN master clock can become desynchronized from the clocks in the intestine, the liver, the pancreas, and other organs that regulate digestion and metabolism. That’s because the latter group of clocks can be set by meal timing, and as far as they’re concerned, the meal signal is stronger than the one coming from the SCN. Usually, this isn’t a problem because the meal signal and the SCN signal are more or less aligned when we eat during the day. The conductor is in charge, and the orchestra is playing in harmonious synchrony. Yet when we disrupt the circadian rhythm by eating late at night, traveling to a faraway time zone, or doing shift work, some of our organ clocks can fall out of sync with others. What would normally be a harmonious performance is reduced to a disorganized cacophony. Researchers call this circadian desynchrony and hypothesize that it leads to metabolic problems and weight gain. To test this idea, Arble studied two groups of mice, both eating the same fattening diet. One group had access to food only during the twelve hours of the day when they would normally be awake and active, while the other only had access to food during the twelve hours of the day when they would normally be asleep.139 Under normal, unrestricted conditions, mice eat about two-thirds of their food during the wake cycle and one-third during the sleep cycle. In Arble’s experiment, however, they could only eat during one period or the other, leading to two circadian conditions: one in which digestive and metabolic clocks were synchronized with the master clock in the brain, and one in which they were desynchronized. Surprisingly, mice in both groups ate the same amount of food. Yet after two weeks, a striking trend began to emerge: the synchronized mice were hardly gaining weight, while the desynchronized mice were gaining fast. By the end of the six-week experiment, the desynchronized mice had gained nearly two and a half times more weight than the synchronized mice, and they tended to have more body fat as well. They were eating the same number of calories but metabolizing them differently.140 Subsequent rodent studies from other research groups have generally confirmed and extended Arble and Turek’s findings. Together, they lead us to two surprising conclusions: The first is that circadian desynchrony accelerates weight gain when rodents are fed a fattening diet. The second, even more striking conclusion is that fattening rodent diets aren’t particularly fattening when they’re only available during the appropriate time of day! This suggests that what is really fattening in these experiments is not simply fattening food but the combination of fattening food and circadian desynchrony.</em></p>

<p><em>Given the profound effects stress exerts on many brain systems, it’s no surprise that it impacts eating behavior. What is surprising, however, is that the textbook response to stress is actually a loss of appetite, reduced food intake, and weight loss. This is certainly true for many types of stress, particularly physical stress—such as the flu—and powerful, acute psychological stress resulting from things like a car accident. But the full story is more complicated. This complexity is well illustrated by the 2007 Stress in America report, which includes data on how Americans react to and cope with stress in their lives. One of the most commonly reported effects of stress was a change in eating behavior—79 percent of people reported such a change. However, people reported conflicting effects. Forty-three percent reported overeating in response to stress, while 36 percent reported skipping a meal, and this result has been repeatedly confirmed by other studies. So it appears that stress can cause you to overeat or undereat, depending on who you are and what type of stress you experience.</em></p>

<p><em>From avoiding predators, to finding scarce food, to competing for mates, the ability to mount a fast and effective stress response is critical to survival and reproduction in a natural environment. Because of this, stress responses are deeply wired into many of our brain systems. Yet stress isn’t just one thing. For example, if you get into a car accident and you’re losing blood quickly, that’s a different kind of stress from when you’re in a meeting with your boss that could end with a pink slip. The first scenario is an example of stress arising from physical damage to your body, while in the second, the stressor is an abstract concept. You’re stressed about the uncertain prospect of losing your job, and all the downstream effects that might have on your future life, such as defaulting on your mortgage or rent, having to explain the situation to your partner, and having to go through the job search rigmarole. This is psychological stress, and it’s the type that affects us the most in affluent nations today. Certain types of psychological stress have the peculiar ability to provoke overeating. Ultimately, although different types of stress provoke different brain responses, they all engage a partially overlapping collection of brain circuits I’ll call the threat response system. The threat response system activates a number of processes that together serve to protect you from danger and help you make the most of a challenge. In 1939, an unusual experiment by the German American psychologist Heinrich Klüver and the American neurosurgeon Paul Bucy took the first steps toward unraveling the core brain circuitry of the threat response system. As part of an investigation into the effects of the psychedelic drug mescaline, Klüver obtained a group of rhesus monkeys and arranged for Bucy to surgically remove specific parts of the monkeys’ brains, including the temporal lobe of the cortex, the hippocampus, and an area called the amygdala. He called these surgically transformed animals “bilateral temporal monkeys.” Although the surgery didn’t have much impact on the monkeys’ response to mescaline, it produced pronounced behavioral changes. Most relevant to us is the fact that it made them fearless. According to Klüver and Bucy: The typical reaction of a “wild” monkey when suddenly turned loose in a room consists in getting away from the experimenter as rapidly as possible. It will try to find a secure place near the ceiling or hide in an inaccessible corner where it cannot be seen. If seen, it will either crouch and, without uttering a sound, remain in a state of almost complete immobility or suddenly dash away to an apparently safer place. This behavior is frequently accompanied by other signs of strong emotional excitement. In general, all such reactions are absent in the bilateral temporal monkey. Instead of trying to escape, it will contact and examine one object after another or other parts of the objects, including the experimenter, stranger or other animals … Expressions of emotions, such a vocal behavior, “chattering” and different facial expressions, are generally lost for several months. In some cases, the loss of fear and anger is complete.</em></p>

<p><em>Decades of research in animal models and humans suggest that the amygdala is the central node of the threat response system that responds to external and psychological threats, including the everyday psychological stressors we commonly call “stress.” In broad strokes, here’s how it works: The amygdala cooperates with many different brain regions, both conscious and nonconscious, to scan for signs of a threat. Some of these regions process concrete sensory information, such as objects moving rapidly toward you, things that look like spiders, or loud sounds, while others process abstract concepts like being laid off, carrying debt, or arguing with a loved one. When the amygdala detects a threat, it communicates with other brain regions to activate a coordinated suite of threat responses designed to minimize the potential damaging consequences of the situation. This is illustrated schematically in figure 45</em></p>

<p><em>How can rhesus monkeys teach us about stress eating? Like many animals, rhesus monkeys spontaneously organize into social hierarchies, and dominant monkeys maintain the hierarchy by harassing and occasionally hitting or biting subordinates. That means Wilson’s team doesn’t have to do anything to create stress: The monkeys do it to themselves. “The primary stressor,” explains Wilson, “is just getting harassed, day in and day out.” Most of the harassment in stable social hierarchies is what Wilson calls noncontact aggression—the monkeys are threatening and chasing one another but not making physical contact. This isn’t too far off from the chronic psychological stress most humans experience, where the stressor is most often a threat of harm (e.g., a fear of being laid off) rather than harm itself (e.g., actually being laid off). Even though no one gets hurt, it’s still unpleasant. And it’s uncontrollable. This lack of control is a key factor in modeling the most harmful types of human psychological stress. In the modern world, we’re often subjected to stressful events we can’t easily control, like traffic, bullying, nagging, illness, deadlines, and debt.147 Research in psychology and neuroscience suggests that uncontrollable stressors have a stronger effect on the threat response system, and are much more harmful to our health and mental state, than stressors we believe we can control. How do these uncontrollable, often social, stressors affect food intake? Remarkably, it depends entirely on the food that’s available. When Wilson’s team feeds its monkeys healthy, unrefined, high-fiber chow, stressed subordinate monkeys eat less and lose weight while dominant monkeys maintain weight. Yet when the researchers give the monkeys a choice between standard chow and a very rewarding high-fat, high-sugar diet, the monkeys’ eating behavior changes dramatically. First of all, not surprisingly, both dominant and submissive animals prefer the rewarding diet and eat it at the expense of the healthy diet. Yet the dominant animals keep eating the same amount of food as before. In contrast, the stressed subordinates double their daily calorie intake. So in the context of a strict healthy diet, stress makes monkeys undereat, whereas when they have a choice between healthy fare and junk food, they overeat spectacularly. Following up on this finding, when Wilson’s team blocks the effects of CRF in the monkeys’ brains, knocking out a key component of the threat response system, the subordinate monkeys stop overeating. This confirms that overeating in stressed monkeys, and perhaps ourselves as well, is a direct result of the activation of the threat response system in the brain.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1910, the neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing saw a twenty-three-year-old patient named Minnie G. who was suffering from a peculiar and distressing disorder. Minnie G. had stopped menstruating, showed excessive hair growth, and most important for our purposes, she had abdominal obesity. Because of the fact that she also had increased fluid pressure in her brain case (hydrocephalus), Cushing suspected that her disorder was caused by a tumor in her pituitary gland that had disrupted her hormone levels. After seeing more patients with a similar ailment, Cushing determined that pituitary tumors were indeed often the cause. These tumors increase the volume of the portion of the gland that secretes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a critical part of the HPA axis that mediates part of the body’s stress response (see figure 47). In turn, excess ACTH tells the adrenal glands to secrete too much of the stress hormone cortisol, which causes the disorder that was eventually named Cushing’s disease. More generally, it’s called Cushing’s syndrome when a person shows signs and symptoms of excess cortisol but we don’t know the specific cause. Cushing was unable to perform an autopsy on the brain of Minnie G., so we’ll never know whether or not she actually had a pituitary tumor, but today we do know that most people who spontaneously develop high cortisol levels do so precisely because of such tumors. Yet there’s another cause of Cushing’s syndrome, which helps us shed more light on the connection between cortisol and overeating: This form is actually caused by medical treatment. Doctors often prescribe drugs similar to cortisol (such as prednisone) due to their remarkable ability to suppress the immune system. This can be useful if a person suffers from severe immune-mediated problems, such as rheumatoid arthritis or organ transplant rejection. Yet when taken at high doses, these drugs cause people to develop the abdominal obesity characteristic of Cushing’s syndrome.</em></p>

<p><em>As we discussed previously, leptin tells the hypothalamus how much fat the body carries, and the hypothalamus uses that signal to regulate food intake and energy expenditure. When the hypothalamus becomes resistant to the leptin signal, adiposity increases. With this in mind, there’s a tidy explanation for why overeating and obesity are key features of Cushing’s syndrome: Cortisol and related compounds cause leptin resistance in the hypothalamus. In 1997, a Swiss research team led by Katerina Zakrzewska determined that removing cortisol from the circulation of rats makes them exquisitely leptin-sensitive, and also lean (technically, these studies manipulated levels of corticosterone, the rodent equivalent of cortisol). Incrementally increasing their cortisol levels makes the rats incrementally less leptin sensitive and incrementally fatter. Research from other groups showed that cortisol-like compounds interfere with the ability of leptin to activate its signaling pathways in cells of the hypothalamus, and increase levels of the hunger-promoting substance NPY.150 Together, this research shows that a key component of the threat response system can interfere with a key component of the lipostat, driving the nonconscious parts of the brain that regulate adiposity and appetite to favor overeating and fat gain.</em></p>

<p><em>Epel’s group has found that some people secrete high levels of cortisol in response to experimental stressors under lab conditions, while others don’t secrete much cortisol at all. The high secretors tend to eat more food when they’re stressed, while the low secretors don’t. Together, this paints a fairly coherent picture suggesting that cortisol may be a key reason why everyday stress can cause overeating and fat accumulation around the midsection. And it also helps explain why only certain people overeat in response to stress. As it turns out, uncontrollable stress—like being hassled all day by four rhesus monkeys or your boss—has a particularly potent cortisol-raising effect. In contrast, when you’re facing a challenge but you have a chance to determine your own fate, the situation feels less threatening, and your cortisol response is proportionally smaller. This may be part of the reason why uncontrollable stress is the most effective at driving overeating and adiposity.</em></p>

<p><em>Jen doesn’t know it, but she tends to secrete a lot of cortisol when she’s stressed—particularly when the stressor feels outside of her control. On her way to work, she faced a maddening traffic jam, and there was nothing she could do but wait it out. When she walked into her boss’s office, she didn’t know what he was going to say, but again there wasn’t much she could do to change the outcome. In the end, she made it to work on time, and the evaluation went fine, but by that time her cortisol levels were soaring. This cortisol traveled to her brain, causing her hypothalamus to become less sensitive to the appetite-restraining effects of leptin. At her meals that day, she noticed that her appetite was unusually large. Each time this happens, Jen gains a bit of weight, especially around her midsection. Yet there’s another, more common-sense reason why some of us overeat when we’re stressed, and research is increasingly suggesting that it could be important: Junk food simply makes us feel better emotionally.</em></p>

<p><em>Human studies were showing that stress doesn’t just change the amount of food we eat; it also markedly alters the types of food we eat. Depending on how you’re wired, calorie intake can go up or down during stress, yet regardless of this, most of us gravitate toward calorie-dense “comfort foods” like chocolate, ice cream, macaroni and cheese, potato chips, and pizza. Dallman suspected that people might actually be using food to self-medicate their stress, dampening the activity of their own threat response systems. To test this hypothesis, Dallman’s team turned to a tried-and-true model of stress in rodents called restraint stress. In this model, researchers place rodents in a small confined space for a short period of time, which activates their threat response systems. Researchers can then measure this activation by looking for increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and the HPA axis, as well as defensive behaviors such as freezing and hiding. To study whether tasty foods can dampen the stress response, Dallman’s team gave one group of rats unlimited access to sugar water for ten days, while another group only got plain water. At the end of this period, researchers subjected both groups to restraint stress and then measured the stress-induced activation of their HPA axis. As predicted by Dallman’s comfort food hypothesis, the group that drank sugar water showed a smaller stress response than the group that drank plain water. It appeared that sugar helped them feel better in the face of stress.152 Yet it’s not just sugar: Dallman and others have since shown that giving rats access to a high-fat food does the same thing.</em></p>

<p><em>What is it about comfort food, exactly, that dampens the stress response? Is it the body’s metabolic response to sugar, fat, and/or calories, or is it the food’s reward value itself? Yvonne Ulrich-Lai, a neuroscience researcher at the University of Cincinnati, set out to answer this question. She and her team offered rats intermittent access to small volumes of sugar water, water sweetened with the calorie-free sweetener saccharin, or plain water, and then measured the activation of their HPA axis following restraint stress. She hypothesized that sugar’s stress-busting effect is due to its metabolic impact on the body, not its rewarding effects in the brain, and therefore that saccharin would be ineffective. “The result,” explains Ulrich-Lai, “was completely opposite my hypothesis. The saccharin worked just as well as sugar.” Subsequent experiments confirmed that the sweet taste itself was responsible. In 2010, her team went further by seeing if rewarding behaviors besides eating also dampen stress responses. To do this, they deployed the only natural reward that can compete with tasty food: sex. Ulrich-Lai’s team gave one group of male rats daily access to a sexually receptive female and let another group of males see and smell a female but not touch her. Then they tested the rats’ stress responses to restraint stress. The sex worked. In fact, according to Ulrich-Lai, it was a little bit more effective than the sugar.</em></p>

<p><em>Together, Ulrich-Lai’s results suggest that rewarding behaviors directly oppose the activation of the threat response system in the brain. Although the finding still needs to be confirmed in humans, it offers a compelling explanation for why we seek highly rewarding junk food (and drugs like alcohol) when we’re stressed: The reward value itself helps us feel better by dampening the activity of the threat response system. It may also explain why stress only causes overeating when there’s highly rewarding food around: When we want to self-medicate our stress, bland food just doesn’t cut it.</em></p>

<p><em>As in a computer, the brain processes this information and uses it to generate useful outputs. Once again, these outputs affect two things: what happens inside the body and what happens outside the body. We call the first one physiology and the second one behavior. So your brain collects information from inside and outside your body and uses it to appropriately regulate what’s happening inside and around you, in order to benefit you. For example, if you see a basketball rapidly approaching your head, you’ll duck out of the way if you can. In that case, your brain collected information from your visual system and used it to generate movements that got you out of the way of the ball.</em></p>

<p><em>First, we encountered the reward system, centered in the basal ganglia, which teaches us how to get food properties—such as fat, sugar, starch, and salt—that the brain instinctively views as valuable. The reward system collects food-related cues from our external sense organs and our digestive tract, and guides us toward valuable foods by helping us learn and motivating our behavior. What we experience is that we crave and enjoy certain foods more than others, and we develop deeply ingrained eating habits around the foods we enjoy. Unfortunately, this system evolved in an ancient world where calories were hard to come by, and obtaining them required a lot of work, and therefore motivation. In the modern affluent world, where calorie-dense, highly rewarding foods are ubiquitous, our hardwired motivation to eat remains strong, and it drives us to overconsume. Next, we explored the economic choice system, centered in the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which integrates the costs and benefits of possible actions and selects the one that’s the best “deal.” This system contains both conscious and nonconscious elements, because it integrates costs and benefits from all parts of the brain that relate to the decision at hand. Some of the costs and benefits it considers relate to system 2 processes, such as predicting the future impact on your waistline of eating a pastry, or calculating whether you can afford to buy it. Yet much of what it considers is nonconscious, and in many animals, including humans, it appears to be wired to value calories above all other food properties. And the easier the calories are to get, the more of them we eat. Another way of saying this is that when it comes to food, its primary cues are calories and convenience. This becomes a liability in a world where calorie-dense foods are more convenient than ever to purchase, prepare, and consume.</em></p>

<p><em>The lipostat is a third system, located primarily in the hypothalamus, which nonconsciously regulates adiposity by influencing appetite, our responsiveness to seductive food cues, and our metabolic rate. It takes its cues primarily from the hormone leptin, which is produced by fat tissue, although it also responds to food reward, protein intake, physical activity, stress, and possibly sleep (as well as other factors that are beyond the scope of this book). The lipostat has one job: to prevent your adiposity from decreasing. And it’s very good at what it does, because in the world of our ancestors, losing weight meant having fewer offspring. This is the system that makes weight loss difficult and often temporary, and it may also be part of the reason why our weight tends to creep up over the years. It partially explains why people with obesity tend to eat more than lean people, making obesity a self-sustaining state. When the lipostat squares off with our best intentions to eat the right amount and stay slim, it usually wins in the end. Working in parallel with the lipostat, the satiety system regulates food intake on a meal-to-meal basis by making us feel full and reducing our drive to continue eating after we’ve had enough. Located primarily in the brain stem, the satiety system takes its cues from the digestive tract, which relays how much volume we’ve eaten, and the protein and fiber content of our food. The satiety system also receives cues from the reward system, which tends to shut down the feeling of satiety when we eat highly rewarding foods, such as pizza, french fries, and ice cream. And finally, it takes important cues from the lipostat, which increases or decreases satiety to help maintain the stability of body fat stores. One of the reasons why modern food tends to be so exceptionally fattening is that it doesn’t provide the cues the satiety system needs to appropriately regulate calorie intake. We tend to use the sensation of fullness as an intuitive signal that we’ve eaten enough, so when we eat calorie-dense, low-fiber, low-protein, highly palatable foods that provide little satiety per calorie, we overeat substantially without even realizing it.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>The sleep and circadian rhythm systems, located in the hypothalamus, the brain stem, and other brain regions, nonconsciously influence eating behavior and adiposity in large part by interacting with the reward system, the lipostat, and the economic choice system. The amount of restorative sleep we get, the timing of our sleep, the blue-wavelength light we see, and the timing of our meals are key cues that regulate these systems. When we don’t sleep enough, or don’t sleep well enough, it increases the reward system’s responsiveness to food cues, and we often end up eating more calories. It affects our economic choice system, promoting an “optimism bias” that makes us think more about the current benefits of eating a pastry than the future costs. And it nudges us to become less faithful to our rational, constructive daily goals, such as eating healthy food. When our sleeping and eating behaviors are misaligned with the day-night cycle of the sun, or with our own internal clocks, it can also cause us to gain weight and undermine our metabolic health. In the modern affluent world, with its time-consuming responsibilities, high rates of sleep disorders, abundant artificial light at night, stimulating media, rotating shift work, and travel between time zones, the sleep and circadian rhythm systems receive cues that often send our eating behavior and weight in the wrong direction. Finally, the threat response system, rooted in many parts of the brain but coordinated in large part by the amygdala, is a largely nonconscious collection of processes that help us manage challenging situations by altering our behavior and physiology. This system takes its cues from a variety of sensory inputs that convey information about potential threats, such as vision and hearing, but also from abstract concepts, such as the possibility of being laid off. In the modern world, most of the threats it deals with are psychological, but in many ways it still reacts as if we’re fighting off wild beasts. It’s not clear that we have more to be stressed about today than our ancestors did, yet it’s possible that we cope with our stress less effectively than we did in times past. In certain people, psychological stress sharply increases cortisol levels, and this may reduce the sensitivity of the lipostat to leptin, in turn increasing food intake and the accumulation of body fat. This is particularly true when we feel like we have little control over a stressful situation. Stress also shifts our eating preferences toward comfort food—which is usually calorie dense and highly palatable—because it helps dampen the activity of the stress response system and makes us feel better.</em></p>

<p><em>Nutrition labeling is an example of this approach. While labeling has had some victories like pressuring manufacturers into reducing the trans fat content of processed food,155 telling people how many calories a food contains seems to have little impact on their overall calorie intake in real life. I would argue that it targets the wrong brain circuits. Whether they view their approaches in these terms or not, public health professionals already have a number of weapons in their arsenal that target the impulsive brain. For example, our consumption patterns can be shifted by a strategy called countermarketing. This basically means running negative ads that associate certain products with bad feelings, unpleasant images, or disturbing information (an example of negative reinforcement). It’s the opposite of what ads normally do. Antitobacco countermarketing, with its gory images of blackened lungs and tracheostomies, included ads on television and billboards, and stern warning labels on cigarette cartons. Coupled with crippling tobacco taxes and a growing number of public and private smoking bans, countermarketing contributed to the fact that Americans today smoke 70 percent fewer cigarettes per person than we did in 1963. While the decline in cigarette smoking is a huge public health victory that has prevented a great deal of disease and suffering,156 it was only possible due to a unique combination of factors that doesn’t exist for fattening food. First of all, cigarettes aren’t essential for life, whereas food is. This means we would have to countermarket against fattening foods but not others. It’s much more challenging to split nutritional hairs than it is to oppose an addictive drug wholesale. Second, tobacco countermarketing was (and is) funded by tens of billions of dollars in legal settlements that resulted from antitobacco lawsuits in the 1990s. There is currently no such funding for food countermarketing efforts.</em></p>

<p><em>Another way to guide our eating behavior in the right direction is to make fattening foods a less attractive “deal” to the brain regions that guide our economic choices. Monetary cost is part of this equation, and as such it has received a lot of attention from public health professionals. Simply stated, we tend to buy less of specific foods as they become more expensive and more as they become cheaper. By making fattening food more expensive and slimming food cheaper, we can shift the cost-benefit balance to favor a more moderate calorie intake.</em></p>

<p><em>An alternative way to financially nudge our diet in the right direction is simply to change the way government subsidies are allocated to commodity crops, such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. These three food crops receive more subsidies than any others in the United States—totaling over $10 billion per year. They also happen to be the basis for many of our most fattening food ingredients, such as high-fructose corn syrup, white flour, soybean oil (the primary added fat in the United States), corn oil, and corn starch. In turn, the food industry uses these artificially cheap ingredients to compose extremely tempting and unbelievably low-cost foods—a deal that’s hard for the brain to pass up. Essentially, taxpayers are subsidizing the very foods that make them fat and sick. Shifting subsidies away from foods that make us fat, and toward foods that don’t, is a common-sense idea that could have a substantial impact on the American food system, and ultimately our waistlines. I’ll leave it to the economists and farmers to understand the complex ramifications of changing our subsidy system, but it seems to me that we should be able to support farmers and food security without undermining our nation’s health. Convenience is an additional public health lever that can modify our eating behavior by impacting the brain circuits that govern economic choice. For example, in Detroit there’s a zoning law that requires a minimum of five hundred feet between fast-food restaurants and schools (that’s a bit less than two football fields). However, very few communities have passed such ordinances, and in most cases, the goal was to protect the character of a historic area rather than to promote health.</em></p>

<p><em>The food industry has long known that one of the most effective ways to get a person to buy a particular food is to show her an appealing image of it. If she has eaten the food before, or something similar, this visual cue triggers dopamine release and the motivation to eat the food (craving). This fundamental property of the human brain is one of the main reasons why the food industry spends tens of billions of dollars on advertising each year. The public health intervention here is obvious: Regulate food advertising. Yet in the United States, the government places few restrictions on food advertising. The research of the University of Connecticut’s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity shows that both children and adults in the United States are inundated every day by a deluge of food advertisements, most of which promote unhealthy, calorie-dense items. Americans are well aware of the insidious effect of food advertising on our food preferences and eating habits, yet we’re reluctant to let the government step in.</em></p>

<p><em>Sadly, CFBAI is arguably the most impressive example of US food industry self-regulation in the interest of public health. The fundamental problem is that the food industry is governed by the incentives of a fiercely competitive free market economy, and these incentives sometimes conflict with human health. For example, in the 1970s, Nestlé initiated a campaign to promote its infant formula over breast milk in developing countries, despite the fact that contaminated local water supplies often made formula feeding dangerous. It was a profitable venture, but at the cost of substantial infant mortality. The situation was eventually resolved by boycotts and international regulation. Although not all instances of conflict between profits and human health are so egregious, competition nevertheless creates a “race to the bottom” in which companies jockey to produce the most compelling foods possible and advertise them in the most visible, attractive ways. To do this, they titillate the brain circuits that determine our innate nutrient and economic preferences—which are the same circuits that push us to overeat. The end result is a food system that’s expertly, if unintentionally, crafted to drive overeating.</em></p>

<p><em>Hardee’s sales were brisk following their introduction of the colossal hamburger. Because many of the qualities that coax us to purchase a food are also those that make us overeat, any individual company that voluntarily makes its food less fattening is effectively entering the boxing ring with one hand tied behind its back.157 Executives and shareholders both realize that having one hand tied behind your back usually leads to getting punched in the face. This creates a fundamental conflict between profits and public health—and in the grand scheme of things, profits usually prevail. In my view, the only realistic way out of this downward spiral is nationwide regulation that encourages a more slimming food environment while maintaining a level economic playing field for the food industry. This could happen through industry self-regulation and/or government regulation, but I seriously doubt industry has what it takes to self-regulate us out of our overeating problem.</em></p>

<p><em>First, get rid of all tempting, calorie-dense foods that are easy to grab and eat in your home and work environment—particularly those that are readily visible on counters and tables. This includes things like chips and cookies but also some relatively healthy items like salted nuts. Get rid of the ice cream in your freezer. Don’t give yourself the option to eat these foods, and you’ll find that you crave them less. Second, reduce your exposure to food cues in general. It’s possible to overeat even healthy foods, so don’t tempt yourself too much. Limit the amount of visible food in your personal food environment at home and at work, particularly snack foods that are easy to grab and eat. Minimize your exposure to food advertising on television and elsewhere if you can. Third, create effort barriers to eating. These barriers don’t have to be large to be effective. For example, if you have to peel an orange to eat it, you probably won’t go for it unless you’re genuinely hungry. The same goes for nuts in their shells. Perhaps the most stringent effort barrier is to limit the food in your kitchen to items you’d have to cook or reheat to eat. Chances are, if you have to cook something, you won’t eat it between meals unless you really need it. Putting this together, a healthy food environment is one that effortlessly guides your eating behavior in the right direction. It doesn’t contain tempting, calorie-dense foods or ads that remind you of those foods; it contains little visible food in general; and it provides small effort barriers to eating the healthy food that is visible. Imagine a kitchen in which the only visible foods are whole fruit and nuts in shells, and eating anything else would require reheating something from the refrigerator. Now imagine a workplace in which the only available food is in a refrigerator, with no visible food on tables or countertops. That’s the goal.</em></p>

<p><em>If your brain thinks you’re starving, it will eventually wear you down, no matter how strong your resolve. The solution is to give it the cues it needs to realize you aren’t starving. The most straightforward way to do this is to choose foods that send strong satiety signals to the brain stem but contain a moderate number of calories. These are foods that have a lower calorie density, higher protein and/or fiber content, and a moderate level of palatability. This tends to include simple foods that are closer to their natural state, such as fresh fruit, vegetables, potatoes, fresh meats, seafood, eggs, yogurt, whole grains, beans, and lentils. Bread is surprisingly calorie-dense, even when it’s made from whole grains, so it can be easy to overeat. It may be preferable to get your starch from water-rich foods like potatoes, sweet potatoes, beans, and oatmeal than flour-based foods like bread and crackers. And foods based on white flour in particular, which tend to have a high calorie density and low fiber content, are definitely off the menu. In the long run, you also need to keep the lipostat comfortable with your target weight. We don’t know as much about how to satisfy the lipostat, and we’ll need more research to get a clearer view, but there is suggestive evidence that eating more protein and limiting highly rewarding foods can help. Regular physical activity, restorative sleep, and stress management may also support a leaner adiposity set point, facilitating weight loss and maintenance.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 236 (location ~ 3498-3509)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The brain values foods that contain calorie-dense combinations of fat, sugar, starch, protein, salt, and other elements, and it sets your motivation to eat those foods accordingly. This motivation is partially independent of hunger, such that it’s easy to blow past satiety signals if you’re eating something you love—think ice cream, brownies, french fries, chocolate, and bacon. These foods are a lot more rewarding than anything our distant ancestors ate, and they can powerfully drive cravings, overeating, and eventually, deeply ingrained unhealthy eating habits. When we eat simple foods that are less dense in calories and closer to their natural states, they’re still enjoyable but they don’t have that intensely rewarding edge that drives us to overdo it. These include things like fruit, vegetables, potatoes, beans, oatmeal, eggs, plain yogurt, fresh meat, and seafood. Nuts may not be an ideal diet food, but they are less calorie-dense than they might seem because some of their calories pass through the digestive system unabsorbed. Choosing unsalted nuts reduces their reward value to a reasonable level. Simple foods like these help the satiety system and the lipostat stay in control of our eating behavior, matching our calorie intake to our true needs. Not everyone finds the same foods highly rewarding, but most people have a pretty good idea what their own problem foods are. Common examples include chocolate, pizza, potato chips, tortilla chips, french fries, cookies, cake, and ice cream. Keep these foods out of your personal food environment. You can still eat them occasionally.</em></p>

<p><em>If you’re a dessert fiend and only decadence will do, try eating a piece of fruit with your dinner. This will promote sensory-specific satiety and reduce your craving for sweet foods at the end of the meal. Watch out for habit-forming drugs, such as alcohol, caffeine, and theobromine (found in chocolate). These are inherently rewarding and can motivate us to take in calories we don’t need, such as those in beer, cream and sugar, chocolate, and soda. When you consider that a single alcoholic beverage contains 90 to 180 calories, a can of soda contains about 140 calories, coffee beverages can contain up to 500 calories—and we don’t drink any of those out of hunger—it’s not hard to understand how they can contribute to excess adiposity. It’s best to favor caffeinated beverages that don’t contain calories, such as green tea and black coffee; avoid soda; and if you drink alcohol, consider limiting your intake to one lower-calorie beverage, such as wine or spirits, per day.</em></p>

<p><em>I hope I’ve already dispelled the myth that sleep is a waste of time. Restorative sleep is an important cue for the nonconscious brain that has a major impact on performance and eating behavior—even if we aren’t directly aware of it. The first step toward restorative sleep is simply to spend enough time in bed. This may be all it takes for many people to be well rested. For people who have trouble sleeping, it helps to make sure your room is completely dark at night, allow your room to cool down in the evening if possible, and only use your bed for sleeping and sex. Your circadian rhythm is a related cue that affects your sleep quality and eating behavior via largely nonconscious processes. To give your circadian rhythm the right cues, try to get into bed and wake up at about the same time each day. Make sure to get bright, blue-spectrum light in the morning or at midday, ideally by spending time outside. And in the evening, avoid bright, blue-spectrum light by replacing full-spectrum bulbs with warm white bulbs, dimming lights, using programs such as f.lux on your electronic devices, and/or wearing blue-blocking glasses.</em></p>

<p><em>Regular physical activity can help manage your appetite and weight in at least two ways. First, it increases the number of calories you use, making it less likely you’ll overeat. Studies show that when people with excess weight exercise regularly, their calorie intake tends to go up, but usually not enough to compensate for the calories they burn (although this does vary by individual). Second, physical activity may also help maintain the lipostat in the brain, encouraging a naturally lower level of adiposity in the long run. Our distant ancestors had a word for exercise: life. Movement has always been a key part of our species’ daily activity, and our bodies require it to function properly. It’s a fundamental ingredient for good health, physical and cognitive performance, emotional health, and healthy aging. As such, it’s an essential part of a healthy lifestyle, whether or not your goal is weight management. The most important thing to remember about physical activity is simply to do it, every day if possible. Whether you’re walking, gardening, playing tennis, riding a bicycle, or strength training, it all counts. However, the ideal situation is to train your body using a mixture of different types of activity, as suggested by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). HHS recommends a combination of moderate-intensity activities, such as brisk walking, high-intensity cardiovascular activities like running, and strength-building activities like lifting weights.</em></p>

<p><em>The threat response system evolved to protect us, but sometimes in the modern world it can undermine our quality of life and our best intentions to eat the right amount of food. I’ll outline five actions you can take to identify the problem and manage stress eating by giving your threat response system the right cues. The first action is simply to identify whether or not you’re a stress eater. If you are, then you probably already know it. The second action is to identify the stressor(s)—particularly chronic stressors you don’t feel you can control. These often include work stress, money, health problems, prolonged caregiving, interpersonal conflict, and/or a lack of social support. The third action is to try to mitigate the stressor. There are multiple ways to do this. Can you fix it or avoid it? If not, is there a way you can turn what seems like an uncontrollable stressor into a controllable stressor? For example, if you’re stressed about money, can you make a concrete plan to improve your finances? If you have stressful health problems, can you lay out a concrete road map for managing your condition as effectively as possible? Making a plan will probably help you mitigate your stressor, but even if it doesn’t, it gives you a feeling of control that may reduce your drive to stress eat. Another way to mitigate stress is by practicing mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness is a state of intentional, nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, and meditation is an effective way to cultivate it. Most of what stresses us has little to do with what’s happening right now—it’s usually about what might happen in the future. I might not make that work deadline. I might develop diabetes. My partner might leave me. I might not make my credit card payment. Sometimes these concerns are rational and deserve attention, but they often run away with our minds and emotions in a way that isn’t helpful. By training ourselves to focus on the present moment, we can guide our thoughts in a more constructive direction.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 240 (location ~ 3557-3571)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The fourth action is to replace stress eating with more constructive coping methods. Are there other enjoyable things you can substitute for comfort food when you’re stressed? How about calling a friend, making love, reading a good book, jogging, taking a hot bath, or gardening? At the risk of sounding like a broken record, the fifth action is to remove calorie-dense comfort food from your personal surroundings at home and at work. In the absence of highly rewarding items, there’s less of an incentive to self-medicate your stress with food.</em></p>
