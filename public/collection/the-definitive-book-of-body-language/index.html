<p><em>Our spoken language, however, recognizes how important body language is to our communication. Here are just a few of the phrases we use: Get it off your chest. Keep a stiff upper lip. Stay at arm’s length. Keep your chin up. Shoulder a burden. Face up to it. Put your best foot forward. Kiss my butt. Some of these phrases are hard to swallow, but you’ve got to give us a big hand because there are some real eye-openers here. As a rule of thumb, we can keep them coming hand over fist until you either buckle at the knees or turn your back on the whole idea. Hopefully, you’ll be sufficiently touched by these phrases to lean toward the concept.</em></p>

<p><em>As far as the academic study of body language goes, perhaps the most influential pre-twentieth-century work was Charles Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, published in 1872, but this work tended to be read mainly by academics. However, it spawned the modern studies of facial expressions and body language, and many of Darwin’s ideas and observations have since been validated by researchers around the world. Since that time, researchers have noted and recorded almost a million nonverbal cues and signals. Albert Mehrabian, a pioneer researcher of body language in the 1950’s, found that the total impact of a message is about 7 percent verbal (words only) and 38 percent vocal (including tone of voice, inflection, and other sounds) and 55 percent nonverbal. It’s how you looked when you said it, not what you actually said.</em></p>
