<p><em>THE “DISCOVERY” OF THE OPERATIONAL LEVEL OF WAR Napoleon’s two contemporary interpreters, Jomini and Clausewitz, are the intellectual discoverers of what we today understand as the operational level of war. Antoine Jomini was first. The son of a Swiss banker, from the middle class of that day, the developments of the French Revolution fascinated him. He also had a thirst for military history. He conducted what might be called an operational study of the campaigns of Frederick the Great. From that intellectual endeavor he came up with his famous “principles of war,” embodied in the concepts of maneuver, mass, offensive, and objective. It was only after this initial study that Jomini came to Napoleon Bonaparte’s attention, as well as coming to see the reflection of his principles in the style of war that Napoleon practiced.4 As Professor Tom Huber has said, “Jomini created a theory of deployments,” or for our purposes a theory of how to integrate logistics and maneuver into a theory of operational principles.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 11 (location ~ 155-164)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>At the same time, the Prussian officer Carl von Clausewitz was also reflecting on the nature of war, although publication of his work would not occur until after his death in 1831. Clausewitz also gained his inspiration from the French and every page of his masterpiece On War breathes that inspiration. He spread his ideas about operational art throughout his work, but his most formal notions and writing about operational art can be found principally in three “books” from On War: Book Two on theory, Book Three on strategy, and Book Six, his lengthiest, on defense. In Book Two, he discusses war as both a science and an art, and clearly makes room for what he calls “creative ability.”7 Clausewitz devotes the entirety of Book Three to a discussion of strategy and first defines it as: Strategy is the use of the engagement for the purpose of the war. The strategist must therefore define an aim for the entire operational side of the war that will be in accordance with its purpose…. he will draft the plan of the war, and the aim of the war will determine the series of actions intended to achieve it: he will, in fact, shape the individual campaigns and, within these, decide on the individual engagements.8 [emphasis mine] Compare this with the Army definition found in Field Manual 3–0: The operational level links employing tactical forces to achieving the strategic end state. At the operational level, commanders conduct campaigns and major operations to establish conditions that define that end state.9 [emphasis mine]</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 11 (location ~ 168-182)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>it was the Russians who developed some of Clausewitz’s ideas a bit further, once removed by way of another German, the historian Hans Delbrück. Hans Delbrück’s great contribution to the theory of war was to break strategy into two types, an annihilative strategy (Neiderwehrfungsstrategie) that tended toward quick, rapier-like offensives and an attrition strategy of exhaustion (Ermattungsstrategie) that emphasized, often, the defense, and wearing one’s enemy down until the final offensive coup de grâce. Delbrück used the same database as Jomini, the campaigns of Frederick the Great, and found that Frederick triumphed in his war more through the use of exhaustive strategies and maneuver than through the annihilation of his enemy in short decisive campaigns like Napoleon conducted for most of his career.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 13 (location ~ 194-199)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the leaders of the Imperial Russian Army, the German intellectual framework formed the starting point for their thinking about how to organize, mobilize, and (most of all) think about war in the brave new industrial world. Their defeat in the Crimean War against the Turkish and Anglo-French forces convinced them of the need for reform and they turned deliberately to a Prussian model that included freeing their serfs (as the Prussians had done after their defeat in 1807). Freed serfs provided the Russians a huge manpower resource for conscription on the Prussian model, not just a reflection of Western liberal principles and the “rights of man.” These reforms also resulted in a German system for operational staffs and military education that would prove breeding grounds for the nascent operational artists and theorists of both the late Tsarist and early Red armies.14 Nevertheless, the Russians made substantial intellectual progress of their own, but initially within the confines of a German operational design that depended on the short decisive war of maneuver without fully understanding how Moltke’s approach differed from the Jominian-Napoleonic models.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 14 (location ~ 207-215)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Given the exhaustion of the Soviet Union after constant war from 1914 to 1922, and the need to rebuild an industrial economy, Svechin naturally favored a strategic defense and exhaustion as best suiting short-term Soviet needs, although he also believed in the offensive under the right circumstances based on his study of the famous Brusilov Offensive in 1916. In his 1926 book, Svechin for the first time defined operational art: “Then, battle is the means of the operation. Tactics are the material of operational art. The operation is the means of strategy, and operational art is the material of strategy. This is the essence of the three-part formula given above.”18 Svechin’s ideas irritated the inclinations of Marshal Mikhail Tukachevsky, who believed that the Soviet Union, if properly mobilized and correctly fighting in depth on the battlefield, could win with a series of operational blows on the offensive “as the means to conduct decisive operations in a total war.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 15 (location ~ 225-232)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The idea of “deep battle” also permeates the Soviet writing on operational art. The two most prolific authors on this score were V. K. Triandafillov and G. S. Isserson.22 Of the two, Isserson is perhaps more important for our purposes. Both of these Soviet officers believed that modern operations in the future total war must be executed throughout the depth of the battlefield. At the operational level, this meant that one must plan for both simultaneous and successive operations, to meet the enemy’s tactical, operational, and strategic reserves. These reserves, or defensive “echelons” as Isserson called them, were to be met and dealt with in turn by offensive operational echelons. Isserson was perhaps most explicit in laying a formula for how to do this: A modern operation essentially elicits distributed efforts in time, thereby conditioning strategy…. Modern operational echelonment is the sequential and continuous increase of operational efforts aimed at breaking enemy resistance through its whole depth…. While deploying for a modern deep operation, it is necessary to calculate forces and means both along the linear dimension of a front and in the new dimension of depth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 16 (location ~ 244-254)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>“Operational art is characterized first by the distributed operation: an ensemble of deep maneuvers and distributed battles extended in space and time but unified by a common aim.” This definition includes the existence of “temporal and spatial distribution” in the conduct of a campaign. The relationship between this “characteristic” and what the U.S. Army labels deep operations is in fact the fundamental discriminator between operational art and classical strategy.25 Modern U.S. Army doctrine defines deep operations as those that “engage enemy forces throughout the depth of the battle area and achieve decisive results rapidly.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 18 (location ~ 272-277)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Schneider’s next element is the distributed campaign, which he characterizes as the distributed operation’s “final structure,” the product of the operational artist’s vision. Several characteristics of distributed campaigns include the subordination of battle to maneuver, and then, “Because modern warfare emphasizes battles and maneuver, distributed campaigns are inherently exhaustive.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 278-281)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Continuous logistics is a third element found in operational art. “In order for a modern industrial army in a theater of operations to maintain a militarily effective presence, its logistics system must be continuous.” Schneider makes the analogy that in modern warfare the laws of Newtonian physics are replaced by the laws of fluid dynamics. The dynamics of war using the operational art construct more closely resemble fluid laws governing distributed operations and modern industrial warfare just as Newton and classical physics (mass, accelerations, force) were superseded by the laws of fluid dynamics and later the laws of probability and quantum mechanics.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 281-286)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The fourth element is instantaneous command and control. Distributed operations generate more information; therefore, command and control must be instantaneous. Schneider’s criterion here relies on the technology of the telegraph in order for operational art to be in its most mature form. In this discussion, Schneider uses the battles of Jena-Auerstadt (1806) and Waterloo (1815) as examples to prove his point. Schneider hypothesizes that had Napoleon had telegraph at either of these two engagements the results may have been very different.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 287-290)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Russians may have had operationally durable formations as early as the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763)—the time when European armies were becoming difficult, if not impossible, to destroy in battle. This dynamic will be another key component in this analysis, since many scholars focus precisely on the Napoleonic period as giving birth to such formations as a result of the total mobilization of the nation-state. Until 1809, the French armies almost always had an asymmetric advantage over their opponents because their armies were durable as a result of mass conscript, their patriotism to serve the colors, and Napoleon’s institutionalization of the new combined arms organizations—the division and army corps—which combined artillery, infantry, and cavalry to make these units even more durable should they encounter an enemy unit on their own. Although Napoleon’s opponents adopted these measures—in 1809, the first such anti-French army was put in the field by Austria—it was rare that a Napoleonic Field Army was destroyed in one day’s battle or even in one campaign.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 20 (location ~ 302-310)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Operational vision, a distributed enemy, and distributed deployment comprise the final three elements, or criteria, that Schneider uses to characterize operational art. Schneider associates operational vision “with mental agility, the ability to react to incoming information faster than it arrives.” Schneider adds that a staff plays a “crucial role…in sustaining that vision.” Therefore, this book uses the following definition for operational vision: seeing beyond local operations and results to a future end-state that accomplishes strategic goals. This vision must be exercised in a distributed environment, which is often a very broad front with some depth, similar to that described by Schneider, in order for it to be operational. As discussed earlier under instantaneous command and control, Schneider indirectly gave Napoleon credit for being a distributed enemy, by using two of his campaigns as examples relevant to a discussion on instantaneous command and control. However, for mature operational art to present we must also look for instances where both sides operated in a distributed manner, not just one side or the other. In almost every instance where French armies fought a counterinsurgency (COIN in today’s parlance) against guerillas and irregulars—in the Alps, in Spain and Portugal, in southern Italy, in Russia in 1812, and in Germany in 1813—their enemies were distributed. However, because the French also fought against conventional forces in all but one of these COIN campaigns—a type of conflict known as compound warfare—this aspect of operational art will be discussed as a component of these campaigns rather than separately from them.34 Schneider provides no precise definition for distributed deployment, but does tie this element to the industrial revolution and a nation’s capacity to wage war. Nations must “defend—and seize—the resource and production base.” This element would seem to be a given if the operation is distributed and nations have undergone</em></p>

<p><em>Usually there is no need to invent a new approach if the problem can be solved with existing means. Such was the case with the emergence of what I have been referring to as operational art. The thinking and writing about operational art, like the calculus, emerged from several different contexts in separate parts of the world during a relatively short time span of history. Just as Gottfried Leibniz and Issac Newton, among others, sought to solve the seemingly intractable problem of figuring out complex kinematic trajectories and the area under a curve, so too did the operational theorists labor to solve what they saw as emergent problems related to the complexity of modern, industrial war.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>In 1792, the French Revolution developed into a general European war known variously as the Wars of the French Revolution or alternatively as the War of the First Coalition (against France). It thus encompasses the broad canvas of campaigns as France fielded Europe’s first modern “armies of the people” under the leadership of men who rose under the system known as “careers open to talent” in France. It concluded with the key campaign by the young General Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy that brought about the first general truce, excluding Great Britain, and an end to the War of the First Coalition.1 Napoleon Bonaparte consolidated and further institutionalized the reforms that gave birth to the type of warfare and the wars that came to bear his name. A better name for these wars, as already alluded to, is the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Because of this, students of this period of military history often become confused about what Napoleon brings to the table as a military innovator. Napoleon implied that he did not end the Revolution; rather he tamed its excesses and institutionalized what was good in it (laws, education, religious tolerance, egalitarianism, etc.).2 Similarly, he did not create a military revolution; rather he further consolidated, refined, and improved upon the existing system as a means to further what he saw as his own progressive policies. Military staffs, combined arms divisions, the levée en masse, new tactics, excellent artillery, and a host of other reforms and innovations that are often associated with Napoleon in fact predated him.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 27 (location ~ 404-417)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The first innovation to flow from these reforms was the creation of the division as a standing, and not ad hoc, military formation. Originally the French had used the term to specify independent formations from the main army, but it came to mean the administrative division into which France was divided for military purposes. It was not long, however, until a separate system of combat divisions, aligned with the administrative divisions, came into being. These divisions were composed of the infantry forces of the administrative district with clear military responsibilities for defense. The subunits of organization under these “divisions” were regiments composed of battalions, but the battalion was the basic infantry building block and included anywhere between 500 and 1,000 rank and file. The reforms of the Comte de St. Germain (Count of St. Germain) in 1776 had established two battalions per regiment, usually one for field service and the other a cadre, or depot, battalion.5 As mentioned, these divisions were normally not what we would call combined, or mixed, arms formations. Sometimes there was attached cavalry but rarely did they include engineers (Genie) or artillery organic (inclusive) under the oversight and control of the divisional commanders, whose duties were mostly administrative in nature.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 28 (location ~ 430-439)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If one wants to see what a postwar but prerevolution French combat division might have looked like in the field, with various arms attached, all one needs to do is examine the organization of the Comte de Rochambeau’s component of the Anglo-American army during the Yorktown Campaign. Rochambeau’s force numbered approximately 7,800 troops and included infantry, cavalry, engineers (to help with the siege), and abundant artillery. Bonaparte’s future chief of staff, the famous Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier, served in this formation as an engineer officer.7 Berthier’s prerevolutionary service highlights several points about the French army of this period. First, one could be an officer and not be from the aristocracy if he served in the “scientific” arms such as the artillery or the engineers. Second, Berthier was from the middle class, his father also being an engineer officer, and so foreshadowed a trend that the Revolution would formalize using the sons of the emerging middle class as officers. A Counter-Reformation of sorts would eventually occur in the last years of the French dynasty against Comte de St. Germain’s reforms, which resulted in even these officers being required to have an aristocratic pedigree, but the point to be made is that for these “disesteemed” branches, the French army already had a system of merit in place if the officer was content to never achieve high command or rank or practice his trade outside his selected “branch” of service.8 The “career open to talents” existed in embryonic form prior to the Revolution. Finally, Berthier’s status actually changed prior to the revolution, when he became part of a new branch in the French officer corps conceived by another prerevolutionary reformer, Pierre-Joseph Bourcet.</em></p>

<p><em>A year prior to the fiscal crisis that led to the French Revolution, more organizational reforms were implemented under Louis XVI. First, the brigade was established as a permanent formation with permanently assigned regiments. Additionally, these brigades “were formed into 21 combat divisions.” It has been speculated that these organizational innovations may not have lasted had the French Revolution not occurred and served as a forcing function to not only leave them in place but also to expand on them as the paradigm changed from one of cautious conservative innovation to sometimes incautious Revolutionary experimentation. However, these divisions were still almost entirely infantry formations, but they did occasionally train in the field with the other units.11 Two other areas that saw reform had to do with light infantry tactics and artillery. By the time of the Revolution, France possessed the most rationalized and well-organized artillery in Europe due to the famous “Gribeauval” system that reduced the French guns into four standard calibers and made the actual equipment lighter and more maneuverable. Additionally, an officer named Jean du Teil, part of a group of increasingly professional and intellectual French officers, advocated using these more mobile guns primarily against infantry, not the enemy’s guns.

<p><em>The other area of reform had to do with light infantry tactics, an area that the French had been poor at in the Seven Years’ War and that the American Revolutionary experience seemed to indicate was of more importance. The epitome of tactics had come to be represented by the linear Prussian system of Frederick the Great involving strict discipline and the elimination of initiative from all but the most senior officers on a battlefield. Among the officers discussing these reforms were du Teil, the Comte de Guibert, and the Duc de Broglie, men of the Enlightenment who believed that France could excel in military affairs as she did in all other areas of intellectual activity (at least from a French perspective!) De Broglie, along with the Duc de Choiseul, had been instrumental in the reforms leading to the establishment of the division.</em></p>

However, if one were to go to the 18th-century version of Las Vegas and make a bet based on the numbers, France would surely have been the long shot of long shots in 1792 to win against two of the foremost military powers of Europe—Austria and Prussia.</em></p>

A defeat of the Austrians later that fall delivered the Austrian Netherlands (Belgium) to Dumouriez and the conquering French.

After the execution of Louis XVI in January 1793, Great Britain, the United Provinces (the Dutch), and later the Kingdoms of Spain, Naples, and Sardinia all entered the war against France. Additionally, the French were now faced by a skilled Austrian commander of the old school, the Prince of Coburg. As Dumouriez invaded the Netherlands, Coburg struck at his flanks, forcing him to pull back and then decisively defeated him at the battle of Neerwinden in Belgium on March 18, 1793.

Fortunately, the French had the example of the prewar division ready to hand to implement and employ. Much experimentation took place, but eventually the regiment was replaced for a time by something known as the demi-brigade, a formation that married up two of the new conscript or volunteer battalions with one of the old royalist battalions, giving a total strength of three and sometimes four battalions in a demi-brigade. Two of these demi-brigades were in turn supposed to be combined into a larger full brigade. Because of the shortage of officers to command brigades, this did not happen and often as not the demi-brigades were grouped together into divisions of varying size under one general, instead of having the intermediate level of the brigade requiring additional generals between the demi-brigade and division levels.</em></p>

<p><em>Another area that the creation of these mass French armies stimulated was the size and number of staffs in the French field armies. The creation of the division led to the establishment of staffs on the model institutionalized in 1792 for the army commanders. Specialized staff officers, if available, were appointed as chiefs of staff. By 1799, the number of these specialist staff officers, the “topos” of the old regime, increased to 110. Also, not all of the assigned officers to these new staffs were formally trained given the shortage of officers; many of them learned “on the job” under the veteran chiefs of staff like Berthier. Often the only requirement was literacy and even a rough-and-ready former cavalry trooper like Ney was used as a staff officer because of his ability to speak and write German as well as French, although he would later take on the young Jomini as his chief of staff to do this sort of necessary, but often tedious work.23 All of these developments, plus the constant campaigning, had the result of creating a very large body of young, experienced, and toughened officers who would form under Bonaparte an extremely valuable cadre of professional officers to conquer, rule, and administer an Empire.</em></p>

<p><em>When Napoleon Bonaparte was finally given the command he sought in early 1796, it was of the most ragged and ill-supported French army—the Army of Italy. The army had been neglected for much of 1795, was ill-fed, and unpaid. The new “political” general was only 26 years old and was elevated over some of the most veteran and competent generals in the French army—Andre Masséna, Charles-Pierre Augereau, Jean Serurier, and A.E.F. La Harpe. These men were to command Bonaparte’s divisions with his army’s cavalry under the veteran Baron Stendhal. Additionally, he had Berthier, possibly the best staff officer alive, as his chief of staff. Historians have frequently commented upon Bonaparte’s fortune in inheriting such a talented group of subordinates, but initially they took what might be regarded as a “wait-and-see” attitude toward the young upstart from Paris. It was not long, though, before they gave him their respect and their best efforts. Bonaparte brought with him many young officers of his own choosing that later gained great fame—Andoche Junot, Auguste-Frederic Marmont, and Joachim Murat being among his closest associates and friends. He also famously included a trunk of books by the likes of Caesar, Plutarch, and Xenophon and other military histories among his personal belongings for the campaign trail—for he was a voracious reader and slept little.</em></p>

<p><em>from an operational standpoint, the idea of a coordinated offensive on such a broad scope using the bulk of four armies (a fourth smaller army was to connect the operations with each other in Switzerland), did give the entire concept the characteristic of a distributed deployment. Logistics would almost certainly be a weakness and the idea of instantaneous command and control is laughable—except for the fact that Bonaparte would operate almost entirely without regard to the other armies, following his own vision of how best to achieve victory. His goal was first to defeat the Austrians in his theater, and if the armies in Germany failed, he might find that he could turn his theater into the main effort of the 1796 campaign. If in fact the latter outcome was his goal, he was to be amply rewarded. This in turn might lead to his making as being among the first rank of French generals—not just as a political favorite of the regime.</em></p>

<p><em>The Austrians were another matter. Their generals were veterans, many of them having fought against Frederick the Great in the Seven Years’ War as well as in the current conflict. Their greatest weakness was their caution and constant underestimation of the French and Bonaparte. But caution was also their great strength for it prevented Bonaparte on many occasions from trapping them and destroying their entire army. Only near the end of the campaign did Bonaparte finally destroy an army, and a small one at that, shut up in the fortress of Mantua, but it took him over eight months to do it. The Austrians were thoroughgoing professionals and their troops were veterans who fought well and sometimes out-marched the reputedly swifter French. A weakness at the operational level for the Austrians was the centralized control of their armies to a much greater degree by something known as the Hofskriegsrat, also known as the Aulic Council. This term stands for “court war council” and represented a sort of political-military general staff. Austrian generals had to get their plans of operation approved by this council and keep it updated any time major deviations occurred, as opposed to the French generals who often ignored Paris once the campaign had begun.31</em></p>

<p><em>The key to Bonaparte’s operational design against the Austrian-Piedmontese coalition was to capture the central position in a key mountain pass that led over the Maritime Alps and separated the armies of Generals Colli and Beaulieu. Between them these two generals had over 55,000 troops as opposed to Bonaparte’s threadbare field force of around 37,500. The Austrians helped Bonaparte to some degree by attacking the far right portion of his positions near Voltri in early April. After a perfunctory repulse by the local French commander, Bonaparte judged his right safe enough to launch his Italian “blitzkrieg” into the juncture of the two Allied armies. In 10 days in April, his forces won three major battles at Montenotte (April 12), Dego (April 14–15), and Mondovi (April 20) (see map 2). At the first location he surprised and mauled an Austrian division, and then defeated an Austrian counterattack at Dego. While the Austrians recovered, he turned on the Piedmontese forces and defeated them in detail, driving rapidly on the capital of Turin. On April 28, 1796, the King of Savoy (who ruled Piedmont and Sardinia) signed an initial peace with General Bonaparte, which was duly forwarded to Paris for ratification.</em></p>

<p><em>Bonaparte’s command and control relied heavily on the initiative of his divisional commanders, most of the tactical actions not being controlled by him, but by his veteran subordinates. His forte in this early campaign was in the way he moved his units around—one day the main effort being on his left, and the next that same unit being used as a reserve or flanking force for another division. Bonaparte controlled at the operational level—but in order to sense how the battle went, he moved around the difficult terrain of this part of Italy, constantly on the move, writing orders, assessing the situation, and then issuing new orders as his computer-like brain integrated new information. Later writers, such as the air force officer John Boyd, would write extensively about Bonaparte’s method as getting inside his adversaries’ “decision cycle,” using something Boyd characterized as the “OODA loop.” OODA stands for observe, orient, decide, act—and his raw notes still attest to his fascination with how Bonaparte excelled at this sort of rapid decision-making at the operational level.</em></p>

<p><em>At the insistence of the Hofkriegsrat, Alvintzy’s offensive began in early November. Bonaparte’s plan to meet it involved opposing both advances with single divisions. He also had to maintain a strong operational reserve around Verona under himself. He waited for an opportunity to strike the Austrians separately before they could unite in the vicinity of Verona. Davidovitch’s column performed its portion of the task effectively, manhandling the French division facing it and pushing down the Adige valley toward Verona. Fortunately for Bonaparte, Alvintzy advanced lethargically against Masséna’s division. Bonaparte rushed to shore up his left flank, bringing Masséna with him (but not his troops) and restored his shaken troops. At the same time, Davidovitch paused, giving the French some extra time to rest and reconstitute after their earlier defeat. Alvintzy, meanwhile, had resumed his advance but did not have the bulk of his army with him. Bonaparte, with a wary eye on his rear, gathered his “operational reserve” and proceeded to Caldiero where he attacked Alvintzy’s 18,000 troops on November 12. Bonaparte failed to throw Alvintzy back, taking more casualties than he inflicted. He left a small garrison in Verona and retired to the western side of the Adige River line. His plan was to recross the river to the south and seize the Austrian supply trains, forcing them to fall back through lack of logistics. The result was a hard-fought, three-day battle in the marshes and streams around the Adige in the vicinity of Arcola (November 15–17; see map 5). Bonaparte assumed the tactical offensive, attacking again and again with his smaller force (initially 19,000 strong). Both armies suffered greatly, but Alvintzy’s nerve gave way on day three and he retreated up his line of communications to the Brenta valley.46 Through hard fighting and some luck, Bonaparte had survived the key crisis of the campaign, although Alvintzy’s army was still “in being.” As to the other Austrian forces and Bonaparte’s luck—Davidovitch had remained lethargic during much of the battle and Würmser did not sortie. Bonaparte, showing some sophistication in joint warfare, had built gunboats to help patrol the swamps surrounding Mantua and cover the exits from which a sortie might erupt. Bonaparte now punished Davidovitch for his lethargy, gathering up the garrison of Verona and most of his remaining army he rushed north to the vicinity of Rivoli. Davidovitch realized his peril and scuttled back up the valley toward the Tyrol. The Austrians were still not finished. Despite this latest setback, Vienna demanded another push to relieve Mantua, and Alvintzy gathered over 28,000 troops to descend the Adige valley through Rivoli to do just that. He left considerable detachments to perhaps break through to Würmser while he fought Bonaparte in the north. This plan failed miserably when Bonaparte, on the tactical defense at first, repulsed Alvintzy at Rivoli on January 14, 1797, and then achieved perhaps his greatest tactical victory to date the next day, taking the offensive and eliminating Alvintzy’s army as an operational threat, inflicting 15,000 casualties upon it. Next to Arcola, it was the most decisive French battle of the campaign, although he had, as usual, been very ably supported by his subordinates, Masséna in particular. Again Bonaparte’s central position and active defense helped him gather even more laurels as his men repulsed a sortie by the weakened garrison of Mantua and then cut off one of Alvintzy’s relief columns and forced it into the already overcrowded fortress. These final operations sealed Mantua’s doom and Würmser finally surrendered on February 2 to spare his men any further suffering and death.</em></p>

<p><em>Meanwhile, Bonaparte, under orders from the Directory, led a force of his freshest troops, if they might be called that, against the Pope and forced the pontiff to sign a peace treaty in mid-February while at the same time extorting some 30 million francs and gaining key territories in the northern Papal States to add to the expanding French holdings in Italy. Even with these distractions and deletions, Bonaparte was able to launch a renewed offensive in early March against Charles’s dispersed forces on a broad front, sending the young and talented General Barthelemy Joubert and a prototype corps of two divisions with attached cavalry against the Tyrol while he advanced against Charles’s outposts along the Piave River (see map 6). Austrian imperial possessions were thus directly threatened in three critical areas—the Tyrol, Dalmatia, and Carinthia—the tables had turned, it was now Bonaparte forcing his enemy to prioritize his defense.

<p><em>They also rushed their best general, Archduke Charles, south to size the situation up and take command. Many generals might have rested and consolidated their gains, but not Bonaparte. He gave Charles very little time to reconstitute the demoralized Austrian troops and integrate the reinforcements that seemed to trickle in from Germany. In the meantime, the Directory sent substantial reinforcements to Bonaparte (two divisions), crafting a new strategy to make his the main effort while at the same time going on the offensive in the now-secondary theater of Germany with the armies there, pressuring the Austrians at all points.48 Meanwhile, Bonaparte, under orders from the Directory, led a force of his freshest troops, if they might be called that, against the Pope and forced the pontiff to sign a peace treaty in mid-February while at the same time extorting some 30 million francs and gaining key territories in the northern Papal States to add to the expanding French holdings in Italy.

<p><em>The 1796–1797 campaign emphasized many elements of operational art as defined in chapter 1. The durability of the units resulted in a sustained and lengthy campaign for over a year. Also, Bonaparte had resorted to a protracted war of attrition against the repeated Austrian attempts to reclaim their lost position in northern Italy. The division was the main unit of operational maneuver in the campaign, and not just by the French, although the French divisions tended to be more mobile than the Austrians and reconstituted more quickly, in most cases, than their counterparts. This was also due to the French losing, generally, much fewer troops in the many engagements as prisoners and casualties. Another feature of operational art is the constant combat and engagement that typifies the more modern type of combat, and this campaign, with some exceptions, was really decided by successive and constant engagement. As noted, on several occasions, Bonaparte’s skillful use of maneuver resulted in his being able to win engagements by echelonment, as suggested by later operational art theory. The fluidity of the campaign, even today, can make one’s head swim—the lengthy marches and maneuvers by both sides were really quite remarkable given how difficult the terrain was and the numbers of significant river and alpine obstacles that impeded maneuver in the old style. Although there was no instantaneous communications, Napoleon seemed to have just the right touch—a type of mission command as mentioned earlier—with his subordinates that served him well when they were on their own without specific guidance from above, making timely decisions based on local circumstances.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>Napoleon Bonaparte’s actions suggest that generals must also be well versed in politics and diplomacy to properly practice operational art, otherwise all the elegance and skill in producing a masterpiece campaign could be undone, either with a continuation of the war or a less than satisfactory peace. Some historians have argued that this latter result is precisely what the French got in 1797 at Leoben and then Campo Formio—but certainly the end of the War of the First Coalition and France’s reduction of enemies to just Great Britain placed her in a very advantageous position.52</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 60 (location ~ 913-918)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In coalition warfare, the situation is much more demanding and complex for the operational artist—he or she must satisfy more than one political master, although certainly the priority goes to the state from which the general originates or to whom he has sworn service (not always the same in that era of cosmopolitan 18th-century generals). For example, Dwight D. Eisenhower served U.S. interests in World War II while at the same time trying to also satisfy the political interests and agendas of his sometimes troublesome allies, the French and the British. The point to be made here is that when campaigns are designed to accomplish military objectives that lead to political results, this is often more difficult in a coalition construct than without it. Napoleon’s foreign minister, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand, derided coalition warfare during the period (referencing Prussia and Austria): “We [French] have given up fearing coalitions: there is a principle of hatred, jealousy and distrust between the Cabinets of Berlin and Vienna which will guide them above all else.”</em></p>

<p><em>Suvorov is of particular interest because later Soviet historiography and military writing identified him as a sort of prototype for the ideal Russian operational artist—especially his very advanced ideas on the importance of training troops.4 Secondarily, the operations of Général de Division Andre Masséna in Switzerland will also be examined. Masséna’s operations are critical to understanding the flow of operations in Italy, but ultimately Massena’s successful campaign in Switzerland, along with a disastrous Anglo-Russian campaign in Holland, were major causes of Russia leaving the coalition and the war. Finally, Masséna’s operations provide further evidence of an operational artist hard at work against a superior foe, mixing offense and defense in the right amounts to overcome difficult challenges and in no small measure prevent the invasion of France by victorious Austrian and Russian armies.</em></p>

<p><em>Austria signed the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797 but Great Britain continued to fight because of French domination of the Low Countries and the resultant closure of these ports to British trade. Also, the specter of a unified Franco-Dutch fleet posed an even greater nightmare for the politicians in London than the economic predicament (see chapter 4). Great Britain redoubled her efforts to find continental allies, but for all intents and purposes she remained alone against France. The Franco-Austrian peace followed a common pattern for treaties during the entire Napoleonic era: it included both open and “secret” provisions. The secret provisions allowed the French and Austrians to get around other obligations that they had incurred in previous treaties, making for realpolitik diplomacy in this period as cynical as any in the modern era. The secret clauses in Campo Formio included recognition of the Rhine as a “natural boundary” for France, yet the details of this boundary remained unresolved. These continuing issues along the Rhine and Austria’s foothold in Italy presaged a likely conflict in the future. French revolutionary leader Abbé Sieyès summed it up best, “This treaty is not peace: it is a call to new war.”</em></p>

<p><em>The end of the eventful summer of 1799 saw the Second Coalition poised to achieve the strategic success denied the previous anti-French coalition.13 Indeed, the initial campaigns resulted in both tactical and (by modern standards) operational victory. British sea power had cut off and stalemated General Bonaparte in Egypt while the Archduke Charles defeated or neutralized the French, under Generals Jourdan and Masséna, in southern Germany and Switzerland, respectively. Finally, the Russian field marshal Alexander Suvorov had conquered Italy at the head of a combined Austro-Russian army. Suvorov’s campaign was in many ways as brilliant, and certainly shorter, when compared to Napoleon’s more celebrated 1796–1797 Italian campaign. Suvorov and his Austro-Russian army effectively destroyed one French army (Scherer and Moreau), severely defeated another (Macdonald), and crippled a third (Joubert). Suvorov “liberated” almost the whole of Italy, placing France territorially farther back than the starting point of Napoleon’s 1796 campaign. Yet, before the year’s end this promising situation had imploded. The Second Coalition collapsed as the Russians withdrew in disgust and became hostile neutrals.14 The final victory that had seemed a certainty in September was doubtful by December. What caused this dramatic and rapid turnabout? In order to understand what happened, and how the brilliant operations of Suvorov in Italy came to naught, we must go back again to the start of the campaign in early 1799.</em></p>

<p><em>The émigré Frenchman Count Langeron—who was one of the Tsar’s many foreign officers—captures this essence best: “All their principles of war come down to their bayonets and their Cossacks…and all their enterprises have been crowned with success.”19 Their leader in this campaign was truly a “soldier’s general.” Hard on his officers, Suvorov was paternal with his men, caring for their well-being, eating their fare, and sleeping on hay or the ground as they did. He shared their hardships and they idolized him in return. One historian goes so far as to say that only Suvorov, of all the Russian generals before and since, really understood the “potential for…innovation that the Russian peasant soldier afforded” his leaders.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 69 (location ~ 1044-1050)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Another key to understanding Suvorov’s success is to understand his revolutionary methods of training. In simplest terms, Suvorov trained for both the tactical and operational environments. His motto was “train hard, fight easy.” He wrote: “Training is light, the lack of training is darkness…the trained soldier is worth three soldiers who are untrained. No! it’s more than that, say six, still not enough—ten is more like it.”21 He took the basic tactics of the Russian army, modified them to his purposes, and then ruthlessly practiced them with the troops under his command. At the operational level he routinely had his troops make forced marches in peacetime of 26 miles or more to build up their endurance. His soldiers often marched as fast, or even faster, than the average French Revolutionary armies. Perhaps one key to this sort of performance was simply that the other Russian generals did not possess Suvorov’s drive, energy, and impetuousness—character traits necessary for the true operational artist.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 69 (location ~ 1050-1058)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For Suvorov, though, because of his method, these engagements were almost always deliberate. Bonaparte would later employ the same method with his corpsd’armée. The French had become the reigning masters of this sort of battle with divisions that deployed rapidly into skirmishers, lines, and columns, but they were to meet their match in Suvorov. He practiced a kind of Russian version of John Boyd’s “OODA” cycle (see chapter 1), using surprise, assessment, and speed—what one historian calls his “triad”—to turn the operational and tactical into one dynamic, violent continuum. He trained his soldiers accordingly, making them understand that surprise was normal by introducing it into his training exercises.23 Suvorov explained this method during the 1799 campaign to the Austrian general Bellegarde: “speed and surprise substituted for numbers [while] hitting power and blows decided combat.” He got his striking power from his constant focus on training. Like his counterpart at sea, Lord Nelson, he sought rather than eschewed battle in order to apply that power directly to his surprised enemies. On land he materialized much as Bonaparte had done from unexpected directions and then ruthlessly kept his enemy fixed as other echelons arrived to contribute to his combat power. What is most fascinating about this campaign, his last, is that he obtained a nearly similar result with his Austrian troops that he had not trained. This was a testimony to his methods of leadership but also to the inherent untapped potential of the veteran Austrian troops he employed as part of his army.</em></p>

<p><em>Charles was removed and a more pliable military commission replaced him, headed by the same General Alvintzy defeated so handily by Bonaparte at Arcola and Rivoli.25 In the end, the only “reforms” implemented were a new musket, new uniforms, and a superficial reorganization of the army. A good feel for the doctrine is captured in the following excerpt from the book Generals-Reglement of 1769: Regular, trained, and solid infantry, if it advances in closed ranks with rapid steps, courageously, supported by its artillery, cannot be held up by scattered skirmishers. It should therefore refuse to lose time either by skirmishing or by the fire of small groups…. It should close with the enemy as rapidly and orderly as possible, so as to drive him back and decide the action quickly. This is the method that saves lives; firing and skirmishing costs casualties and decides nothing.26 [emphasis mine] Tactical instructions issued to General Zach in 1800 echoed this sentiment, indicating that nothing really changed from 1796 to 1799.</em></p>

<p><em>Moreau was called in to help Scherer, and predictably the rearguard forces at Rivoli were thrown back. On April 5, Scherer advanced again from his main camp at Magnano against Kray’s forces just west and south of Verona for one more try to break the Hungarian general’s resolve. Even with Moreau and extra reserves brought down from Rivoli, the Austrians had the slight edge in numbers (44,000 compared to the French 40,000) and were buoyed by their recent victories. This was one of the largest battles, both in geographic expanse and numbers of troops, to occur in Italy to this point in the wars and it was a severe French defeat. Kray, an expert in light infantry tactics, used a Suvorov-like tactic in his counterattack that decided the battle, an all-out grenadier attack on Scherer’s right “with fixed bayonets” according to one observer. Kray’s men inflicted over 8,000 casualties on the French, shattering the morale and confidence of Scherer’s troops and their generals. The French fell back to the line of the Mincio River, anchored by the fortresses of Peschiera in the north and Mantua in the south (see chapter 2, map 4).40 The results of Magnano had serious consequences for the French. In addition to pulling back to the Mincio, Scherer recommended Macdonald and the Army of Naples come north, completely abandoning central and southern Italy; he also offered his resignation.</em></p>

<p><em>On April 17, 1799, Suvorov assumed command of the Austrian force, arriving ahead of his own troops, who were at this point marching up to 30 miles a day. A point worth remembering was that the Austrians requested that Suvorov assume the overall command in Italy, even though the Austrians had the preponderance of force. Modern doctrine would have given an Austrian the command.42 Actually, the first choice had not been Suvorov, but a variety of factors, including the untimely death of Frederick of Orange (a Dutch prince originally slated for the overall command) conspired to give the command to Suvorov. He was chosen by default due to his stellar reputation from the Turkish and Polish wars. Suvorov had already done two things to offend his Austrian partners. While in Vienna the old Marshal had refused to discuss his strategic plans with the members of Hofkriegsrat, including Thugut. Suvorov remained uncommunicative on his way to the front with his Austrian chief of staff, General Jaques Gabriel Chasteler, who also attempted to discuss operations with him.43 Even so, when Chasteler arrived ahead of Suvorov at Kray’s Headquarters, he was still bubbling with enthusiasm about his new chief.</em></p>

<p><em>Suvorov’s second tactless act was to issue a series of instructions to the Austrian officers delineating which tactics to employ and under what specific circumstances. One of Suvorov’s directives detailed that the infantry was to form into “two lines” from the column at one thousand yards from the enemy and then advance slowly to three hundred yards, this being the maximum range of the excellent French musketry. Then, when the order to advance was given, the troops should proceed at the usual rate, but after a hundred paces they must double their speed, and a hundred yards short of the French line they must rush at it…with bayonets leveled. The second line was to follow through while the first, having delivered their charge, halted and reformed.45 [emphasis mine] Here was the idea of the echeloned attack (albeit at the tactical level) where the momentum of the offensive could be maintained by a fresh second echelon while the first reconstituted, presumably to be passed through the second echelon at some later point if need be. Suvorov announced to his army that, “We have come to beat the godless, windbag Frenchies. They fight in columns and we will beat them in columns!”46 There is an apparent contradiction here between the use of columns or lines that is easily explained. Suvorov used both. This again goes back to his transition between operational maneuver and grand tactical employment for battle, usually a meeting engagement. His purpose was to maintain the impetus of his attack on a broad front while maintaining the advantage in movement and cohesion provided by the column. As we shall see, this operational method was to work quite well with the Austrians, in fact they may have executed it more skillfully than their Russian comrades who often did not form line but remained in column for the duration of an attack.</em></p>

<p><em>Suvorov maintained generally good relations with his Austrian staff and wore an Austrian rather than a Russian uniform to emphasize his spirit of cooperation.50 Suvorov’s intent was to give the French no time to recover and to liberate Lombardy while preventing Macdonald from joining up with Scherer (still in command for a few more days). Leaving Kray to prosecute the sieges of Peschiera and Mantua, he advanced northwestward and along the right bank of the Po with about 50,000 Austrians and Russians. First to fall, with its entire garrison (1,130), was Brescia on April 21 after a brisk bombardment and a threat to put the entire garrison to the sword if they did not surrender. To the south, an Austrian detachment advanced on Cremona, which was seized on April 22.</em></p>

<p><em>Masséna’s defensive victory at Zurich in June 1799 reminds one of the Duke of Wellington’s victory in Portugal at Busaco in 1810 against Masséna himself (see chapter 7). In both cases, a fine defensive victory was followed by an operational retreat to a more advantageous terrain—a superb example of defensive, attritional warfare in the hopes of one’s enemy making a mistake and creating the opportunity for a counterstroke. Masséna’s new position also provided better protection for his southern flank, which had been uncovered by the conquest of Lombardy and the threat now posed by Suvorov to Piedmont. At the same time, Masséna’s army was renamed the Army of the Danube and his command limited to Switzerland as a new Army of the Rhine was formed from the forces holding along that river north of Basel. Masséna also received reinforcements directly from France equating to a division of infantry and a brigade of cavalry.</em></p>

<p><em>Operationally, the Battle of the Trebbia highlighted for both sides the importance of rapid maneuver over long distance and then fixing one’s enemy by feeding reserves into the battle as they arrived. Suvorov’s goal was always to prevent a juncture of the two French armies and his skill in doing so reminds one of Bonaparte’s actions at Castiglione and around Mantua. The French lost at least twice as many casualties (not including their rearguard) as the Austro-Russian army, a clear testament to the training and combat power of both the Russians and Austrians against a veteran, well-led French army. A final note on the battle of the Trebbia concerns the actions of General Melas. The Austrians had already been campaigning longer and, to a certain extent, were fatigued. But the Russians were also spent after their numerous forced marches. One historian has noted that it was “curious” how slow and ineffective Melas was in supporting Suvorov on both June 18 and 19. All accounts of the battle agree that Melas responded slowly. Even Macdonald admits that had he been hard-pressed on the second day (June 18) he did not know what he should have done. Rather than improve the unity of effort of the coalition, the conduct and results of this bloody battle combined with other negative trends to undermine the unity of the coalition in this theater. In May, prior to the Trebbia battle, some of the Austrian generals “complained about Suvorov’s crude tactics and unnecessary losses and risks (emphasis mine).”63 Suvorov had already lost his excellent chief of staff Chasteler due to Austrians who schemed against that officer simply because of his devotion to Suvorov. Colonel Weyrother, Chasteler’s replacement, became just as devoted to Suvorov, but this move indicates trouble in the coalition ranks was starting to have a negative influence.64 Was Melas in fact one of the officers that had been complaining about casualty rates and did he rectify the situation locally during the battle by dragging his feet? No solid proof exists, but the “curious” nature of his actions argues that he may have.</em></p>

<p><em>Joubert’s defensive position had its left flank firmly anchored in the Maritime Alps at Pasturana with strong defensive positions in the center around Novi. Joubert’s right was weak and “in the air,” but it seemed safe because Melas was still distant and Joubert was unaware of his approach. Suvorov’s conduct of the battle was simple. He intended to fix the French with heavy attacks on their left, then their center. As these attacks proceeded, he would deliver a flanking blow using Melas against the French right. Finally, he used wider flanking movements, one composed of a cavalry force and another Russian contingent under Rosenberg, to maneuver on the French rear. The Austrian general Kray “begged” Suvorov for the honor of opening the attack on the French left with his corps. Of note, Suvorov was routinely organizing his army into multidivision corps, sometimes even combining Austrian forces with Russians—predating to some extent the formalization of the corps as an operational organization by the French under Napoleon.</em></p>

<p><em>The fragile unity of effort that still existed in the field was soon to collapse at higher levels due to three factors: (1) the strategic shift of Suvorov to the north, (2) the dispute over the issue of sieges versus an annihilating pursuit and expulsion of the French from Italy, and (3) the cumulative heavy losses to the Austrian army in all theaters, but especially Italy. A week after Novi, Suvorov finally received official orders for his transfer, with his Russian troops, to Switzerland. He was opposed to this move because “with the loss of Italy, one cannot win Switzerland.” However, Suvorov’s disputes with the Hofkriegsrat, which had ordered him to cease his pursuit of Moreau, finally convinced him to observe, “I cannot continue to serve here.”72 Suvorov’s problems with his subordinates only worsened. Melas resumed his hostile attitude and refused to obey Suvorov’s orders if they did not correspond with the orders he now received from Vienna. Although Suvorov had won the decisive battle of the Italian campaign, the Austrians no longer felt the need for his services in Italy. Baron Thugut’s correspondence reveals the prevailing Austrian attitude toward Suvorov at this juncture: The innumerable inconveniences caused in Italy by the conduct of this general [italics mine], acting according to foreign [Russian] orders and obviously opposed to the interest of His Majesty, are of such a grave nature that His Majesty could easily do without his commanding an army [in Italy] if having him sent to Switzerland is happily followed.</em></p>

<p><em>Masséna and Suvorov had not actually fought within eyesight of each other in this final operational match, but that is the way of operational art, one’s combinations are often unseen and frequently dependent on the initiative and leadership of operational subordinates. Masséna can be said to have defeated Suvorov at Zurich, even if he did not defeat him in person during the harrowing Russian operations in the heart of the Swiss Alps. Masséna went on to earn the sobriquet of “Dear Child of Victory” and the acclaim of the Republic while Suvorov received orders to return to Russia with his army and was dismissed in disgrace by an ungrateful Tsar. The old Russian died, heartbroken it is said, not long after in 1800. In conclusion, the collapse of the Second Coalition was due to many factors, not the least of which were the divergent war aims of Austria, Russia, and Great Britain. Nonetheless, Suvorov’s handling of the Austro-Russian army in 1799 in Italy strained an already fragile unity of effort. Suvorov saw the fine instrument that he had in the Austrian infantry and used it to maximum advantage. The Austrians performed, in many respects as well or better than their Russian comrades, whose very nature dictated the tactics that Suvorov employed. In the process Suvorov damaged this instrument with excessive casualties. More importantly, it was never “his instrument” to begin with, it was only on loan. He may have better served his cause to have understood the constraints for its use before decimating it in two bloody battles. The wastage of Austrian troops since the war’s beginning in March, a scant five months earlier, now numbered more than 100,000. The Habsburg dynasty could ill afford to continue these bloody campaigns and hope to have an army to control their empire, much less fend off the Turks, Prussians, and even Russians.86 The Austrian decision to let the Russians assume the main offensive burden at the end of the summer of 1799—in the light of all this evidence—is not surprising.</em></p>

Ironically, the battle was not decisive in the ways some have characterized it—neither for its immediate impact on the general war in Europe in 1805 nor for its impact over the long term on strategic events.3 Simply, the Battle of Trafalgar was decisive because it both embodied the successful application of superior sea power by the major European maritime power and emphasized the necessary role that command of the sea by Great Britain would play in shaping the eventual defeat of Napoleon.</em></p>

<p><em>As can be seen, the constant here was British—not just Nelsonian—excellence and dominance over the other major naval powers (and not just the French). The British strategic problem was to ensure that its enemies’ navies (composed of large ships-of-the-line or battleships) remained isolated and unable to mass superior force against the British.10 The best way to do this was with a blockade (or a preemptive attack as in the case of the Danes). If breakout and unification were attempted, the British actively sought battle to restore the blockade. Herbert Rosinski, a famous professor at both the German and American Naval War Colleges in the 20th Century, wrote that In all narrow seas such as the Baltic, the North Sea, the Mediterranean or the West Indies, wherever fleets face each other at easy striking distance, there is and has been one and one way only for a naval commander to ensure the safety of his charges, and that is by sweeping his opponent from the board altogether obtaining against him undivided “command of the sea.” Nothing short of that will suffice.11 Rosinski concluded: “Nor is blockade merely a way to acquire ‘command’—by forcing the enemy to come out eventually and offer himself to battle—but it must be considered itself a form of command, because…it fulfills its function of excluding our opponent from the use of the sea [emphasis original].”12 J. C. Wylie, an American naval officer who was indirectly influenced by Rosinski, characterizes this sort of strategy as a cumulative strategy, and contended that attempts to employ what he called a sequential strategy against it are often inadequate, especially if the primary power is attempting to use land power against a sea power that does not share a land frontier with it.13 Cumulative strategies often employ protracted, distributed military operations whose cumulative result denies an enemy something valuable while often conferring to its practitioner something valuable in return.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 102 (location ~ 1561-1577)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The key to British dominance lay in the combination of several factors. The first of these is training, or more appropriately, seamanship and gunnery training. This factor was closely tied to the second, which has to do with the British tendency to aggressively blockade enemy fleets in port and actively seek battle with adversaries at sea. Because of its operational policy of being a sea-going and active fleet, the Royal Navy naturally had highly developed skills in both navigation and seamanship. Additionally, the Royal Navy, and in particular, leaders like John Jervis, Horatio Nelson, and Samuel Hood, realized the advantage they had in being able to practice extensively with their guns in the unfettered environment of the open sea—a skill much harder to practice in the calm, cluttered waters of a port. Gunnery in that age involved an almost ballet-like level of orchestration and the British had managed to accomplish a superior firing rate over every other navy, but only through continual and relentless training and practice with live ammunition. These skills, superior seamanship and gunnery, only got better as those of the enemy declined with the maintenance of a blockade. When battle did occur, the British often had more maneuverability and the enemy fleet often had the difficult choice of either accepting battle or running away.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 104 (location ~ 1582-1591)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>By the time of the French and Napoleonic wars, the French and Spanish were designing larger and often faster ships than their British counterparts. Speed enabled them to refuse battle more readily while the heavier weight of gunnery, it was hoped, would help balance the British rate-of-fire superiority. Further, the French, in particular, trained extensively on the accuracy of their long-range gunnery and focused on achieving what is referred to in today’s military terminology as a mobility kill. The French would aim at the British ships’ masts, rigging, and helm in order to disable their ability to close with them, or if closed, to get a maneuver advantage in order to negate British firepower in a slugging match. In response, the British emphasized closing with the enemy fleet and boarding its ships if possible. Additionally, British gunners were trained to fire at the enemy hull in order to kill gun crews and personnel in preparation for boarding, and failing that, to sink the enemy vessel—but the goal was to try to capture the enemy vessel intact and then add it to the Royal Navy. The British also equipped their ships with the more destructive guns of the carronade type, which were meant for use at close range and used a composite load consisting of a large round shot and a keg filled with hundreds of musket balls. Nelson’s flagship often carried two of the largest type of carronade, which fired a 68-pound solid round shot combined with a keg loaded with 500 musket balls—clear the decks for action indeed! British long-range gunnery was thus not as excellent on its ships of the line (battleships) but rather on its smaller screening ships such as frigates and brigs.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>The next action he took was unprecedented and sealed his fame—with San Josef still close aboard, he continued with his boarding party across the captured ship and boarded and took the larger ship from his new prize. Meanwhile, Collingwood had pounded three more Spanish ships to pieces and taken one of them. Of the four Spanish ships taken, two belonged to Nelson. Cordoba’s flagship, the gigantic Santissima Trinidad had struck her colors, too, but was rescued by several other Spanish ships before the British could board her. Many of the Spanish ships that survived were badly damaged and thousands of valuable gun crews and sailors had been killed by the deadly British fires. The Battle of Cape St. Vincent highlights how absolutely decisive general engagements at sea can be, although they are much rarer than land battles because either belligerent often can refuse battle. In fact the Spanish were attempting to do just that when Nelson made his famous maneuver. It was a spectacular victory and earned Nelson a knighthood (of the Bath) and promotion to rear admiral. The King made Jervis Earl of St. Vincent in honor of the great victory, and Spanish sea power remained cowed until peace was signed in 1802 at Amiens.</em></p>

<p><em>Nelson was desperately short of frigates (he had only three) to provide him intelligence and decided Napoleon’s destination must be Naples. Bonaparte instead went to Malta and conquered it, as we have seen. Nelson realized his mistake and decided that Napoleon’s next objective was Alexandria, Egypt. He rushed off arriving in the vicinity of Alexandria on June 29 and found nothing. Brueys and Napoleon had taken a different route north of Crete and sailed far slower than Nelson imagined. Nelson missed a great chance by not waiting off Alexandria, second-guessing himself and sailing north to Turkey. While Nelson sailed north, the French arrived and began to debark their troops. It seemed that Nelson had lost the game of cat and mouse and missed a golden opportunity to destroy both a French army and a French fleet.30 Nelson, like all great operational artists, did not give up. Off Sicily he learned of his mistake and doubled back as fast as his ships could sail to Alexandria. Late on August 1, he arrived and found the transports empty, but Brueys’ 13 battleships and many smaller warships were still anchored close in to shore in the shallow and treacherous waters of Aboukir Bay. Brueys had unwisely sent half of his gun crews ashore to assist Napoleon with the land campaign. He also thought himself unassailable so close in to the shore. The final nail in his coffin was the late hour of the day. Surely Nelson would not attack in such dangerous waters with the onset of night? Nelson, demonstrating his intuitive grasp of the weakness of the French, instantly decided to attack.</em></p>

<p><em>Nelson had the complete confidence of his 15 battleship captains and this was rewarded by his confidence in them. Nelson also had the advantage of probably having some of the best captains, ships, and crews in the entire Royal Navy under his command at this battle. The 10 battleships that St. Vincent sent him under Sir Thomas Troubridge—who had served as a midshipman with Nelson—were later referred to by Nelson himself as, “the finest Squadron that ever sailed the Ocean.” He also knew most of their captains personally, having served with most of them in combat, knowing only three by reputation alone. He soon remedied this deficiency by proactive efforts. After barely missing the French at Alexandria and as he sailed about looking for them, Nelson instituted the policy of bringing his captains individually aboard the flagship to mess with him and to share their ideas with him and he with them. In the words of a contemporary observer, “he would fully develop them to his own ideas of the different and best modes of Attack…they could [as a result] ascertain with precision what were the ideas and intentions of their Commander without the aid of further instructions.” This, in short, epitomizes operational mission command, especially in a battle at sea where directing one’s subordinate in the heat of an engagement often proved difficult if not impossible. On June 22, Nelson brought his four most senior captains aboard Vanguard and asked them for their opinion on which way the French might have gone. They voted for Alexandria—they were all thinking along the same lines as Nelson but this shows he trusted in their judgment. On July 17, just before turning the squadron back to Alexandria, Nelson brought all 14 captains to the flagship to ensure commonality of purpose and a shared understanding for what he expected from them in the battle he was convinced would occur soon—if he could only find the French fleet. Nelson’s only real “error” prior to the battle involved his reluctance to formally appoint a second in command since he was actually junior to several of them and did not want to upset the cohesion of the team in making one of them the object of jealousy by the others he did not pick.</em></p>

<p><em>The aggressive captain of the lead ship Goliath was Sir Thomas Foley. He instantly made the decision to go behind the first French ships and inside the French line. About half the other captains followed his initiative while Nelson signaled the remainder in the last bit of daylight to follow Majestic (74) on the northern side (see figure 2). This resulted in a double envelopment of the French ships in the first part of the line. Their mates further down the line were anchored solidly and could not help them.34 To make matters worse, some of the French ships had not strung cable between their neighbors to counter the known British tactic of “breaking the line” and then shooting longitudinally into the aft and bows of the anchored French ships. Again, taking local tactical initiative, several British ships performed this maneuver, especially Leander (50) and Alexander (74), dealing out further bloody devastation against the hapless French ships that were their targets. The night sky of Alexandria was lit up with the din and spectacle of burning French ships as Nelson pounded the French fleet to pieces while his ships proceeded down the line. Brueys’ flagship L’Orient (120), surrounded on two sides in this manner and the second largest battleship in the world, blew up after absorbing incredible punishment, including combustible grenades that Captain Alexander Ball of the Alexander had specially prepared to set French ships afire if he could get close enough. Only Admiral Pierre Villeneuve in the rear escaped with two battleships and two frigates. The rest of the French fleet—including 11 battleships—was destroyed or taken. Nelson, in the thick of the fighting as usual, received a nasty head wound. 35</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon needed a way to diminish or remove the British naval dominance from the Channel and devised a daring plan to divide the British fleet. Nelson and the Admiralty believed that Napoleon would again try to disrupt their lines of communication to their key East Indies colonies by attacking either Malta or Egypt (as in 1798) as one way to distract the Royal Navy. Instead, Napoleon ordered Villeneuve to break out of Toulon and go west to threaten the British colonies in the West Indies, a tactic the French had employed with some success during the American Revolution. En route, Villeneuve would combine his fleet (11 battleships and 6,400 troops) with a Spanish fleet under Admiral Carlos Gravina. The French emperor hoped that Nelson would follow Villeneuve across the Atlantic. If all went well, Villeneuve would combine his force with whatever other French ships had broken out from Atlantic ports and made it to the Indies. In the meantime, the main fleet under Ganteaume would break out and proceed into the channel to cover the invasion. If Ganteaume did not escape on his own, Villeneuve’s return with a combined Franco-Spanish fleet might be the agent for concentration of all three fleets, which would then press into the Channel for either battle or to cover the invasion, whichever occurred first. Unfortunately, Napoleon never sat his admirals down and explained the entire scheme to them, so that they often only knew the bare minimum of the details only after they had put to sea and opened their sealed orders. This was a recipe for disaster.42 Napoleon’s plan, of which there were more than eight iterations, had many moving parts and relied on almost perfect synchronization between the various French and Spanish squadrons in order to mass in the correct place and at the correct time. It also relied on Nelson taking the bait and proceeding to the Indies in hot pursuit of Villeneuve. It came very close to success in achieving the desired concentration. By early 1805, many of the British ships had been at sea for over a year and were in need of repair and their crews were in need of rest. It was at this opportune time that Villeneuve made his first attempt to execute Napoleon’s instructions. However, foul weather and the poor condition of the French ships and crews forced Villeneuve to return to Toulon. However, Villeneuve’s first attempt had caused Nelson to make a grave error. He assumed that Villeneuve was sailing for Alexandria in Egypt as Napoleon had done in 1798. By February 7, 1805, Nelson and his 13 ships of the line had arrived off Alexandria, but they were in very poor condition. This was not only a result of their lengthy time at sea since the outbreak of war but also due to the Admiralty’s failure to perform hull maintenance on many of them during the respite offered by the Treaty of Amiens.</em></p>

<p><em>Nelson and his fleet were in the meantime accomplishing the impossible, pressing across the Atlantic in three weeks in their leaky undermaintained ships—an act of incredible seamanship. They shaved off critical weeks from Villeneuve’s head start. In fact, Nelson arrived on June 4 and was already hunting for Villeneuve. Once Villeneuve learned of Nelson’s presence, he set course for the Bay of Biscay and a hoped-for juncture with Ganteaume. Although this was probably the right strategic move, it lowered the morale of the Franco-Spanish fleet, which only saw that it was again running away. Nelson soon learned of Villeneuve’s departure and immediately dispatched the brig Curieux across the Atlantic to inform the Admiralty of Villeneuve’s impending arrival, perhaps in the Channel itself. Luckily, the Curieux ran into the combined fleet and was able to report to the British Admiralty that Villeneuve was indeed heading for the Bay of Biscay. The British high command reacted decisively in positioning over 600 ships of various sizes to meet the Franco-Spanish threat. Again, superior British seamanship had prevailed. Curieux also passed word to the Admiralty of Nelson’s own return (He had provisioned and set sail about a week after he dispatched the Curieux.) It was at this point that Nelson temporarily disappeared from the story.</em></p>

<p><em>Nelson reiterated his intent in a famous memorandum written after his conferences and dinners aboard the Victory on October 9. Nelson’s memorandum emphasized several keys to the victory that have already been mentioned: superior gunnery and seamanship. Nelson outlined for his captains that he did not plan to form new lines of battle once Villeneuve’s fleet was sighted. In order to take advantage of superior British seamanship and trap Villeneuve he intended to waste no time forming up for battle but rather his ships’ positions—what was called their order of sail—would also be their order of battle. This would give him speed. Second, he wrote that “no captain can do very wrong if he places his Ship alongside that of an Enemy.” This instruction emphasized his belief that his fleet was ship for ship and man for man superior to that of the French and Spanish. It was also written to emphasize to his captains that if signals could not be seen from the flagship then they had complete autonomy to engage the enemy as they saw fit. Nothing Nelson ever wrote has emphasized the principle of decentralized execution as cogently. Finally, his intention was no mere victory but rather “annihilation” of the entire enemy fleet.50</em></p>

<p><em>Historians have argued that Trafalgar had been won before the first shot. This is probably hyperbole but contains much truth, nonetheless some hard fighting had to be done and so we return to Nelson’s masterpiece to see how it all played out in execution.53 Nelson had 27 battleships to 33 for Villeneuve, but this quantitative disadvantage was more than compensated for by the superior morale, leadership, planning, seamanship, and gunnery of Nelson’s fleet. Nelson continued to stalk Villeneuve the next day as the Frenchman proceeded east-southeasterly toward Gibraltar with the combined fleet, however the pace of the French and Spanish advance was so slow that Nelson outran Villeneuve and had to bring his entire battle line around 360 degrees in order to fall back into a correct position vis-à-vis the combined fleet. Villeneuve by now had learned he was being stalked. Despite his numerical superiority at 7:30 a.m. of October 21, he ordered his fleet to “wear” back toward Cadiz and began a gradual turn of the entire fleet back to port.54 He was literally running away from battle. This did not affect Nelson’s plan appreciably; the only difference would be that Nelson’s column would strike near the main body of the combined fleet’s line while Collingwood’s would now strike the rear.</em></p>

<p><em>Nelson then added a final edge to his fleet’s fighting mettle when he sent, sequentially, two significant signals, neither of which were tactical but rather inspirational as a means to give his men a combat edge. The first signal elicited a spontaneous outbreak of cheering throughout the fleet: “England expects every man will do his duty.” This signal was passed a quarter of an hour before the first gunfire and nearly five hours after Nelson had ordered the turn toward the enemy. He followed this with a signal for his captains: “Engage the enemy more closely.” This signal might be regarded as Nelson’s final turnover of the battle to the discretion of his captains. After this point, the British fleet was now in the execution phase of the battle, which relied relatively little on Nelson’s personal direction and almost wholly on the actions of his subordinates.56 The last minutes of the approach were harrowing as the lead ships of each column traveled under the heavy and concentrated fire of the combined fleet. Nelson and Victory led the northwestern column and Collingwood was in Royal Sovereign (100) at the head of the southeastern one (the French were heading north toward Cadiz). This provides more evidence of the superiority of the British system since the loss of both ships would mean the loss of the two flag officers—however, they were no longer absolutely necessary for success in the overall battle and became more or less fighting members of the crew of the ship they were on. Collingwood won the race and Royal Sovereign crashed into the rear third of the French-Spanish fleet just past noon.</em></p>

<p><em>Bucentaure (80) and the battleship behind her, Redoubtable (74). The French gunners had had much better success against Victory, which lost many of her sails and had had her helm shot away, yet her momentum carried her ahead as planned. Victory’s point-blank broadsides, especially from her 68-pound carronades, caused horrendous casualties in the two French ships. Not long after, a sharpshooter aboard Redoubtable (74) sighted the bemedaled Nelson, who had refused to take cover below decks, took a bead, and fired. The ball hit Nelson in the left shoulder and then ricocheted through his lung, finally lodging in his spine. This mortal combination of wounds led to Nelson’s slow and painful death. Redoubtable now prepared to board the ailing Victory but her boarding party was wiped out by a devastating broadside from the Téméraire (98), following in line behind Victory.58 Much of the remainder of the battle followed this same pattern of devastating close combat, but in all cases the British had the better of it up and down the line. Meanwhile, Villeneuve was frantically signaling his van under the French Admiral Dumanoir to come about to assist in the battle. Dumanoir did not see the initial signals due to the smoke of battle and continued sailing toward Cadiz.</em></p>

<p><em>THE LEGACY OF NELSON FOR NAVAL WARFARE Prior to Nelson’s famous victory, other British admirals had indeed mirrored and even suggested his approach of centralized planning and decentralized execution. One recalls especially Admiral Rodney whose melee tactics against the comte de Grasse during the American Revolution foreshadowed those of Nelson.61 However, the Royal Navy’s institutional attitude toward Nelson’s methods, best highlighted at the Nile, was only occasionally and arbitrarily applied by the other admirals of the fleet prior to that battle. After the Nile, these methods became the norm, not the least because it was Nelson’s way as much as for their excellence from an operational standpoint. The results of subsequent history contradict those who argue for the uniqueness of the results of the “Nelson Touch” and its confinement only to the period of his executive leadership.</em></p>

<p><em>Trafalgar was decisive, but mostly for the period after 1805 and not so much for the events that occurred on land and sea in 1805. The British naval campaign of 1805 and Nelson’s subsequent engagement at Trafalgar embodied the successful application of superior sea power by a major European power and highlight the necessary role that command of the sea by Great Britain would play in shaping the eventual defeat of Napoleon. Finally, Nelson’s style of command demonstrated the superiority of the principles of centralized planning, decentralized execution, and operational mission command for the successful prosecution of modern naval warfare.</em></p>

<p><em>We owe it to Napoleon…that we now confront a succession of a few warlike centuries that have no parallel in history…we have entered the classical age of war, of scientific and at the same time popular war on the largest scale (in weapons, talents, and discipline). All coming centuries will look back on it with envy and awe for its perfection. Frederich Nietzsche1 This chapter examines the period of Napoleon’s most dazzling campaigns with an instrument of war that bore little resemblance to anything that preceded it: the Grande Armée. The three continental campaign wars from 1805 to 1807 highlight the ascendancy of the French on land in the face of established British command of the seas.</em></p>

<p><em>From 1803 to 1805, France and Britain fought a maritime war. By late 1804, however, the winds of war on the continent again began to blow. Tolstoy’s opening line from War and Peace captures the Russian attitude as well as any: “Well, Prince, Genoa and Lucca are now become no more than private estates of the Bonaparte Family. No, I warn you, if you do not tell me we are at war…you are no longer my friend.”2 Tolstoy emphasizes how Napoleon continued the French policy of using peace as an extension of war to aggrandize the state—now officially recognized, by the French at any rate, as an empire. Bonaparte, tossing away pretense, had made himself Napoleon I of that empire. In addition to closing all ports under French control to British commerce, and those of Spain in late 1804, Napoleon’s actions, especially his extra-judicial murder of the Duc D’Enghien after kidnapping him from a neutral area of Germany, led the great powers of Europe to form yet another coalition against him.</em></p>

<p><em>It is to the Grande Armée that we must now turn. Napoleon had considerably refined the French military into an unprecedented operational tool—a field army of unprecedented size organized, commanded, and trained meticulously such that it could operate along multiple lines of operation in a distributed fashion on a very broad front. In short, the maestro operational artist Napoleon fashioned a tool with which to improvise his masterpieces, the brilliant and decisive campaigns of 1805–1809. The Grande Armée was this tool. First, we must understand that Napoleon inherited—or perhaps more accurately seized—a military system already molded to a rather high degree of competence and effectiveness in the crucible of the wars of the French Revolution. He had hundreds of thousands of mature, well-equipped veterans, led by experienced and competent officers, and a state that had been dedicated for 10 straight years to sustaining, training, and employing these military forces. Napoleon institutionalized these changes to the French military machine and then added additional combat power, principally through refinements in organization, education, and motivational psychology. It is to these refinements that we now turn our attention.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>As outlined in chapter 2, the Napoleonic Wars constituted a combined arms revolution in tactics and doctrine. Napoleon continued this revolution, especially at the higher operational levels. Although previous generals, including Napoleon, had employed ad hoc corps, no one had formalized and institutionalized the use of multidivision formations. As the size of Napoleonic armies increased, the need to group divisions together to enhance both their survivability and combat power became obvious. However, a new level of tactical and operational command was needed for these previously ad hoc formations. Napoleon’s genius in this regard was to simply keep doing what the French had done with the division, except at a higher echelon. As an army commander in Italy and elsewhere he had found that his operational span of control could only cover, effectively, no more than about seven or eight subunits. In order to solve this problem with field armies that now numbered a dozen or more divisions each, he needed an intermediate echelon between the division and the army. One might reasonably assume that the solution was simply to create many armies and parcel out these commands to half dozen or more commanding generals, which is what the Directory had done. However, Napoleon wanted to retain absolute unity of command over one gigantic army, into which he would put most of the Empire’s combat power for his command and use only.5 This meant he had to have an intermediate level between the division and the army to effectively control this gigantic mass. Napoleon did this by creating the Corps d’Armée or army corps as a standing military formation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 136 (location ~ 2074-2085)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The second element that Napoleon created as a standing reserve was his artillery. This mostly consisted of the Guard Artillery mentioned earlier, but he often augmented it with artillery from other sources to achieve massive firepower at a decisive point. Its operational function was to give Napoleon tactical options in choosing engagements. It should not surprise us that Napoleon used artillery in this way and that the key to his use of it was concentration and timing. His enemies often outnumbered him in terms of numbers of guns, especially after the disastrous Russian campaign, but Napoleon’s use of his artillery on a battlefield remained a wonder to all who observed it right to the end at Waterloo.</em></p>

<li>Page 138 (location ~ 2108-2112)</li>

<p><em>By 1806, Napoleon was finally able to mount them after capturing the excellent stocks of horses in Saxony and Prussia. By that point the dragoons had become a sort of medium-heavy cavalry, often being used in the same manner as the cuirassiers. For the 1805 campaign, this large force would number over 20,000 men and gave Napoleon many operational options, including using it independently if needed.10 Finally, Napoleon could, and did, use entire Corps d’Armée as reserves, for use as opportunity dictated, especially if they had not been decisively engaged but were near enough for an operational pursuit. At the top of this fearsome instrument of war, Napoleon placed himself, achieving absolute unity of command in strategy, military affairs, and the formulation of what we today would call national security policy. Napoleon informed this unity with a polymath-savant’s brain—he ran this enterprise using the subtle genius of his computer-like mind and his almost inexhaustible capacity for work. His predecessors in this method of civil-military rule are few and constituted his role models—Frederick the Great; John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough; Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden; and Julius Caesar. Napoleon surrounded himself with a staff whose one purpose was the rapid transcription and delivery of his orders and collection of reports and intelligence from his subordinates and augmented with a group of highly trusted aides de camp who could and often did act on his authority at critical points on the battlefield. These men included A.J.M. René Savary, who acted during the 1805 campaign as both an aide and intelligence officer; the scrappy Jean Rapp; and the redoubtable Georges Mouton (later Count of Lobau), whom Napoleon referred to as his “lion.” It was Europe’s first modern general staff, but it would soon be eclipsed in the aftermath of Prussia’s defeat in 1806 and it absolutely depended on the genius of Napoleon to function smoothly.11</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Two other innovations must be discussed. The first was Napoleon’s complete revamping and overhaul of French officer education. Much of great value in the old Royal education system had been swept away by the Revolution but Napoleon made wonderful progress in reestablishing a system of schools to train new officers as well as further educate field-grade leaders. However, all observers agree his incredible wastage of officers, especially junior ones, in his many bloody campaigns threatened to overwhelm the output of this educational system, a system that did not serve him as well as it might have had he had a period of peace to consolidate his reforms. The second innovation regarded his institutionalization, across all of society, of his system of merit in the creation of the legion of honor. Napoleon led the way, always wearing his own legion of honor ribbon prominently, as did any soldier or civil servant who was awarded one. Single-handedly he instituted a device that increased the combat performance of his troops using an institution of honor instead of relying on the older Republican call to virtue. He democratized reward, and it paid him handsomely again and again. Today’s militaries owe their own systems of awards and commendation primarily to Napoleon.12</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 140 (location ~ 2137-2146)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The final innovation for discussion involved Napoleon’s revolution in military strategy, best highlighted by the campaigns of 1805 along the Danube, 1806 in Saxony and Prussia, and, to a lesser extent, in Poland in 1807. As one historian has noted, the Grande Armée gave Napoleon the power to “scramble” his way to victory because his enemies were unable to avoid being fixed and defeated by this new and powerful system of operations.13 Like Suvorov, but on a scale never practiced by the Russian, Napoleon intended the largest possible operational meeting engagement—which sometimes became an entire campaign. This was Napoleon’s idea of strategy, as conceived by both Clausewitz and Jomini, of choosing to devote the bulk of his military power to one theater of operations and then aiming relentlessly at the complete destruction of his adversaries’ military forces in one campaign season. Clausewitz labeled this form of war the higher form or what Jon Sumida has called “(Real) Absolute War.”14 Clausewitz most famously describes it as follows: one might wonder whether there is any truth at all in our concept of the absolute character of war were it not for the fact that with our own eyes we have seen warfare achieve this state of absolute perfection. After the short prelude of the French Revolution, Bonaparte brought it swiftly and ruthlessly to that point. War, in his hands, was waged without respite until the enemy succumbed, and the counterblows were struck with almost equal energy.</em></p>

<p><em>One French division fought off an entire Austrian corps on October 11 at Albeck (just north of Ulm), but was rescued by the arrival of its parent corps (Marshal Michel Ney’s VI) the next day. Ferdinand and about 6,000 Austrian cavalry broke out of the trap, abandoning the hapless chief of staff, “the unhappy Mack” and half of his army inside Ulm. By bluff and demonstrations of force Napoleon hustled Mack into surrendering over 27,000 Austrian troops at Ulm on October 21, ironically the same day Nelson destroyed the Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar. In the aftermath of the capitulation at Ulm, another 25,000 Austrians fell into French hands, essentially eliminating an Austrian field army by the use of maneuver and effective, if unintended, engagements. Napoleon had issued his troops two pairs of boots, and it was probably around this time that they discarded the first pair, if not soon afterward. They famously joked that their emperor won his battles with their feet!23 Ulm emphasized all the major elements of Napoleon’s operational art. His goal of finding and fixing his opponent was achieved when he managed to place the Grand Armée east of Ulm across Ferdinand’s line of retreat. Further, he had concentrated the bulk of his army on the very spot that the Austrians and Russians needed to concentrate their own forces. Although Napoleon was not quite sure of the location of the main Austrian army, he did know that he had placed himself on interior lines to prevent its concentration. As a result, his subordinates defeated Austrian attempts, both to concentrate and to escape, in detail. In the process he bagged the bulk of the Austrian artillery and infantry. Mack neither had the imagination nor the fortitude to break out once he realized his predicament—although Ferdinand did manage to get away with about half of the cavalry he had broken out with.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon now tried to reap further rewards from his success at Ulm by destroying the exposed Russian army under Kutusov, which had advanced as far as Braunau on the Danube (see map 14). Kutusov fell back as soon as he learned of Ulm. Clausewitz has pointed out that the fruits of victory are often squandered when generals fail to follow up victory by a vigorous pursuit. Napoleon can hardly be criticized in late October 1805 on this account; his forces were scattered and in a state of disorganization with many dangers still to face, yet he pressed on with the easternmost corps, hoping for the best. Kutusov frustrated this purpose by deftly playing a game of hide-and-seek along the Danube, which forced Napoleon to advance down both sides of the river. The French army started to dwindle in size as it bled off troops and combat power to secure its lines of communication and as new missions were given to others to account for the Austrian forces in the Tyrol. After a sharp engagement at Amstettin with the advanced guard under Murat, Kutusov put the river between himself and the French</em></p>

<p><em>The catastrophe of Austerlitz proved too much for the Austrian emperor Francis, who agreed to an armistice subsequent to further negotiations for a permanent, but disadvantageous peace. The Russian tsar, humiliated that his first battle had been a resounding defeat, in no small part because of his poor judgment, retreated toward Russian Poland with a much reduced Russian army (mostly composed of the seemingly indestructible Bagration’s corps). The Prussians, who had mobilized their army and were on the point of attacking Napoleon’s strategic flank and rear, hastily demobilized and sent out messages of peace and conciliation to Napoleon. The Swedes and British in Pomerania had no way to attack the French Empire, at least by land, and shelved their plans for an invasion of Hanover and Holland. Although the aftermath of Austerlitz marked the end of the Third Coalition, the Russians, British, and Swedes were still technically at war with Napoleon. Still, it seemed for a time that Europe might at last enjoy a period of peace. As for Naples, it was overrun in early 1806 and the Napoleonic Kingdom of Naples established with Napoleon’s oldest brother Joseph as King.</em></p>

<p><em>The Prussian army of 1806 has often been criticized for being an outdated military institution, living on the glories and traditions of “Old Fritz,” impervious to reform, and completely unready for a war in the new modern style.34 This was not entirely true, although it certainly proved no match for Napoleon. Ever since Prussia’s withdrawal from the First Coalition in 1795, significant members of Prussia’s officer corps made study and knowledge of the new French operational methods of war their focus. Unfortunately, these elements, which we shall label the reform faction, resided inside a relatively new institution, the Quartermaster General Staff (QMGS, founded originally by Frederick the Great). This unique group of officers was analogous to the French staff officer corps of the prerevolutionary era from which officers like Berthier sprang. The staff was composed of three sections and also involved an element for officer education. After the catastrophe of 1806 and 1807, this group controlled the Prussian military and created an entirely new operational framework to oppose Napoleon and the French—the Prussian Great General Staff. To fully understand the origins and purpose of the QMGS and new Kriegsakademie (War College), one must go back to Prussia’s enlightened policy of acquiring talented non-Prussian officers to serve in it ranks. The Prussian military institution had always had a very close relationship with the Dukes of Brunswick, sovereign German princes in their own right. Prussia often used them as independent commanders, giving them field marshal rank. Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick (defeated by Kellermann at Valmy), came from the old school of generalship but was an astute judge of men. It was on his recommendation that the founder of the new Kriegsakademie and head of the third section of the QMGS, a Hanoverian officer named Gerhard Scharnhorst, came into the Prussian army.35</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 152 (location ~ 2331-2345)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The greatest mistake that the Prussians made, after declaring war in the first place, occurred at the strategic level. Ignoring the cautious advice of Scharnhorst to wait for the Russians, Brunswick and Prince Friederich Hohenlöhe, who commanded the next largest army, spent precious days arguing over which axis to advance from Saxony while Napoleon rapidly concentrated his forces as he had done in 1805 for the main effort in the decisive theater. The Prussians launched an offensive toward the eastern side of the Rhine before they had completely mobilized or given the Russians time to join them. They and their unwilling Saxon ally simply grouped themselves into three armies of varying size: the largest numbered about 70,000 troops and commanded by Brunswick who also served as overall commander in chief, Hohenlöhe’s army (50,000), and General Philip von Ruchel’s small army (15,000). They advanced with fewer than 150,000 troops as opposed to Napoleon’s battle-tested, rested, and victorious Grand Armée of over 180,000. There were additional fortress garrisons and detachments that the Prussians had elsewhere, but in moving out to meet Napoleon they did not bring all their available combat power with them, leaving a “strategic” reserve of 13,000 out of supporting distance to their rear.39 Writing not long after participating actively in this campaign, Clausewitz claimed desertion and straggling lowered the effective Prussian-Saxon field force to approximately 130,000 effectives.</em></p>

<p><em>Even though he misunderstood the enemy’s intentions, Napoleon’s forces were well positioned to deal with the planned Prussian movements. Murat and Bernadotte had been given orders to concentrate at Dornburg, midway between Auerstadt and Jena, and could support Napoleon or Davout as events dictated. Davout was to advance south toward Auerstadt and take the Prussians in the flank or rear and to bring Bernadotte under his orders if combat ensued. Bernadotte had the same orders but interpreted them to mean that he need not support Davout, while Murat pressed south to join the Emperor at Jena. In this manner, Davout and his single corps of 26,000 troops marched directly into the path of the retreating Prussian army under Brunswick of almost 64,000 troops48 (see map 18).</em></p>

<p><em>October 14 became the blackest day in the Prussian army’s history. Napoleon arrived at Jena to find that Marshal Ney had launched the offensive there prematurely, and had been repulsed handily. Nonetheless, as his operational reserves arrived, the emperor fed them into the battle and before long the Grande Armée had shattered Hohenlöhe’s army. Ruchel moved up too late in support and was in turn mauled by the victorious French who used massed artillery consisting of four batteries of guns to unnerve his infantry and then scatter them. Napoleon believed that he had shattered the main Prussian army only to receive a dispatch late that night from Davout, over 20 miles away at Auerstadt, informing him that his lone corps had successfully repelled the main Prussian army under Brunswick. Brunswick had been mortally wounded, leaving the Prussian army leaderless at its most critical moment. Davout’s III Corps had then resumed its advance and the entire Prussian army literally disintegrated on the field of battle. Bernadotte had never supported him, despite Davout’s urgent need and the furious sound of cannon just to his north. In contrast, Soult marched to the sound of the guns, despite not receiving any definitive orders from Napoleon, getting his lead division into the fight at a critical moment on the enemy’s right flank at Jena. Davout’s excellent generalship aside, his corps’s performance at Auerstadt stands as a testament to the durability of Napoleon’s Corps d’Armée. French losses for both battles totaled 12,000 (mostly in Davout’s and Ney’s corps) while Prussian losses exceeded 39,000 killed, wounded, and captured, with numerous units fleeing as disorganized refugees and the army’s line of retreat cut.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s destruction of the bulk of the Prussian army did not convince the Russians, British, or the Prussian queen, who bent her weak husband to her will, that defeat need be conceded. Napoleon’s initial peace feelers were rejected by all parties. Thus, there were still large Prussian domains in Silesia, eastern Poland, and East Prussia not under Napoleon’s control. He initially delayed the decision to invade Poland, but soon realized that proceeding to the line of the Vistula River had key advantages. Such a position would protect his flanks and his operations to subdue the great fortress of Danzig and secure the Prussian province of Silesia to the south. Nonetheless, he had to peel away forces to garrison the many Prussian fortresses he had seized. One small fortress at Kolberg in Pomerania—defended by an obscure Saxon in Prussian service named August Neidhart Gneisenau—remained defiant, but was masked by light French forces.58 Napoleon decided to continue the offensive by mid-November, when he learned that a Russian army of at least 56,000 had departed in late October to join the Prussian corps under General Anton Lestoq. The French emperor in turn detached a multinational corps composed of Germans commanded by Prince Jerome and assisted by General Dominique Vandamme to secure Silesia as he proceeded east across the Oder River. Davout had already crossed that river on October 31 and, with the surrender of Stettin, Lannes’s corps was ready to cross by the same day. Napoleon’s losses had been light to this point, but nonetheless he knew hard fighting was ahead after the Prussians rejected his peace terms (November 16). Napoleon brought up the second strategic echelon he had mobilized to free his veterans for further campaigning and replace losses. He also denuded secondary theaters of cavalry units, knowing he would need much of that arm in the vast spaces of East Prussia and Poland.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s haste to come to grips with the Russian army, and perhaps its past performance, led him to overreach. He had made errors in the past, after Ulm and before Jena-Auerstadt, but this was among his most glaring. His chase of the Russians had led him to end up in a cage with a “polar bear” in the extreme conditions of the Polish winter. The two-day icy holocaust of Eylau began late on February 7 and then exploded in a senseless slaughter the next day. As at Austerlitz, Napoleon was outnumbered; unlike Austerlitz, he attacked prepared enemy positions. The battle precipitated an early crisis when Marshal Augereau’s small corps blundered into massed Russian artillery as it emerged out of a blinding snowstorm. Russian cannon obliterated it. To counter this disaster, Napoleon launched one of the most famous cavalry attacks in history, Murat’s splendid troopers superbly mounted on captured Prussian chargers. This charge did not win the battle, but it prevented a defeat. After that, the battle became a bloody back-and-forth engagement as operational echelons from both sides arrived to weigh in on the decision. Davout’s corps, the key to Napoleon’s tactical plan, arrived first and this attack had just begun to bear fruit when Lestoq’s 17,000 Prussians arrived on the scene to give the initiative back to the Russians.63 Just as these measures seemed likely to break Napoleon’s damaged army, Ney’s corps arrived on the scene in the last hours of daylight, causing both sides to cease fighting. Ney captured the essence of the battle upon seeing the thousands of corpses in the snow, remarking “What a massacre, and without any results!”64 Total casualties for the two days of confused fighting totaled over 35,000 and possibly higher, two-thirds of them French.65</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon then did likewise after half-heartedly declaring victory. Napoleon knew he had almost been bested and for the first time the luster of his generalship did not shine. In France, dissatisfaction at these seemingly unending wars began to result in serious evasions by would-be conscripts, leading to the French version of the modern draft dodger—le réfractaire. The losses of veterans in the Grande Armée had been grievous, the superb army that marched into Germany the previous Autumn and the best army of his entire career was badly damaged. More and more his army consisted of foreign elements: Poles, Italians, Saxons, Bavarians, and other contingents from the newly formed Confederation of the Rhine. Although the Grande Armée proved itself again in the spring and again in 1809, Eylau can be considered as the engagement that demonstrated the limitations of Napoleon’s method of operational art when faced with a determined opponent unwilling to surrender and willing to trade space, time, and casualties with Napoleon.</em></p>

<p><em>The short Friedland campaign proved the Grande Armée and Napoleon again as an unbeatable combination because they reflected the new operational way of war while the Russians remained mired in the past, organized and operating under the rules of the 18th century. Nonetheless, the tactical brilliance of Friedland masked the change in the character of Napoleonic operational art that would soon be in evidence in the last part of the decade. This proved to be the last time that Napoleon would have an asymmetrical advantage over his opponents as they adopted the French system of conscription, corps, and concentration of force. In the meantime, Napoleon’s economic warfare against Great Britain took him down a path that ultimately proved to be his ruin.</em></p>

<p><em>However, the outbreak of an extended insurgency in Spain, characterized by both regular and irregular, or guerilla, warfare, also resulted in a situation where the fundamental advantages of Napoleon’s army were checked by a particularly powerful form of insurgent war that historian Tom Huber has labeled fortified compound warfare.2 As manifested in Spain, this form of war saw the mixture of conventional operations by Spanish and Anglo-Portuguese armies with widespread guerilla operations over the vast, mountainous regions of Spain and Portugal. This presented their opponents with a dilemma; Napoleon’s troops could either concentrate to face their enemies’ armies or disperse to control the countryside, but not both.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s many decisions led to what he later regarded as one of his greatest errors, the war in the Iberian Peninsula. He remarked, after the fact, “That unfortunate war destroyed me…All…my disasters are bound up in that fatal knot.”6 His “fatal” mistakes can be traced to his animosity toward Great Britain. He never completely understood how or why his actions and policies alienated that great sea power, in part because his understanding of oceanic trade and commerce was limited to a continental outlook. At Trafalgar he had lost the capability to threaten Britain from the sea, and his disastrous experience in Egypt had taught him that straying too far from the nexus of his strength in Europe to attack British interests did not work either. He thus intensified his policy of economic foreclosure of European markets to British manufactured goods as a means to leverage Britain. This policy had actually existed during the Revolutionary Wars, but because so many of Europe’s ports remained open, it did little to help the French. After the battles of Austerlitz and Trafalgar, a stalemate between the land power of France and the sea power of Britain ensued. However, when efforts for peace fell apart and Britain joined Prussia and Russia in the Fourth Coalition (1806–1807), Napoleon intensified his economic warfare against Britain. With all of Northern Europe (except Russia) under his control, he issued the so-called Berlin Decree in November 1806, closing all the ports under French control (including those in Prussia) to British trade and seizing British shipping.7 The British responded to the Berlin Decree with their own Orders in Council that closed all British ports to shipping originating from France or transshipping through French-controlled ports. Only the ports of Portugal and Russia legally remained open to British commerce on the continent of Europe.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1807, Spain became a cauldron of intrigue as the heir to that throne schemed to depose his royal father and eliminate Godoy. Napoleon realized the problems that a change in the regime in Madrid might entail, writing to his brother Joseph in January 1808, “trouble in Spain will only help the English…and waste the resources that I get from that country [Spain].” Meanwhile Junot and about 1,500 famished troops (out of an original 25,000) arrived in Lisbon on November 30 just after the Portuguese royal family had fled with the bulk of its navy and its entire treasury to the protection of the Royal Navy off the coast. This episode should have been a warning to Napoleon of the operational difficulties of rapid maneuver in the rugged terrain of the Iberian Peninsula. The British threat dominated Napoleon’s thoughts as he pushed more troops into Spain, including a corps under General Dupont who was given orders to proceed deep into Spain, ostensibly to counterbalance English reinforcements that had arrived at Gibraltar.11 Earlier, Napoleon, under the terms of his alliance with Spain, had used the large Spanish division of the Marquis de la Romana in the siege of Stralsund. He now moved it into Denmark to guard against further British actions there. This action had serendipitously denuded Spain of some of the best troops in her army at a critical time.</em></p>

<p><em>after a palace coup in March 1808 caused King Charles IV to dismiss the hated Godoy and abdicate in favor of Prince Ferdinand, Napoleon used this occasion to summon all parties to Bayonne for mediation (see map 21). Once there, he deposed and imprisoned both father and son and appointed his brother Joseph, currently reigning as the King of Naples, as Spain’s new monarch. The first action was celebrated by the Spanish people, who blamed the King and Godoy for their misrule and defeats by the British, believing better times would be had with Ferdinand. However, the deposition of the popular Ferdinand rankled the masses of peasants, priests, and the proud aristocratic Spanish officer corps who still believed that God appointed kings, not French Emperors. Prior to Ferdinand’s imprisonment, Napoleon had peacefully occupied Madrid with forces under Marshal Murat. The presence of ever more French troops throughout Spain, including in places like the province of Catalonia that were nowhere near Portugal, also caused resentment, especially since the ill-supplied French troops often behaved in their normal rapacious and rude style toward the locals.</em></p>

<p><em>French arms suffered disaster in the southernmost province of Andalusia. By this time Murat, who had become seriously ill just as the revolt was breaking out, had turned over his command to one of Napoleon’s aides, General Jean-Marie Savary. At the end of May, just as revolt was breaking out everywhere, General Dupont’s corps had proceeded south toward Cadiz. He had gotten as far as Seville, which his men plundered, before being recalled by Savary. Loaded with loot, he dithered for much of the month of June south of the Sierra Morena Mountains as another column of French troops moved south from Madrid to join him. Dupont had little idea of how exposed his command was. Through a series of miscues and poor French decisions, rather than any outstanding Spanish generalship, two Spanish armies totaling over 40,000 men managed to place themselves between Dupont and his escape route north at the town of Baylen. The column under General Vedel that was to join him had marched north and left no guard at Baylen to keep the escape route open. After weak attempts to break through, Dupont surrendered his force of over 11,000 tired and dispirited troops on July 20 to the Spanish. The Spanish threatened to massacre Dupont and his men if he did not recall Vedel, who was escaping to the north. In a stunning display of cowardice and incompetence, Dupont ordered Vedel to surrender and that individual stupidly obeyed. The total bag in prisoners was over 17,000 French. Europe was stunned on hearing a French corps had been annihilated (literally, as it turned out, when the Spanish reneged on every promise and sent their prisoners to die of disease and neglect on prison hulks at Cadiz and elsewhere).</em></p>

<p><em>Wellesley came from the British nobility of Ireland and was the younger brother of the powerful and influential Richard Wellesley, Lord Mornington, scion of the Wellesley family. Wellesley had faced considerable challenges in his military career, due to the competition with other ambitious British officers who were often his seniors and the varying fortunes of his political allies, especially his brother Richard. As a younger officer he had participated in the disastrous British campaign of 1794–1795 in the Low Countries and according to one biographer learned that, “war was a serious business which should be undertaken in a thoroughly professional spirit or not at all. Having discovered what defeat was like, he gained a fierce determination to avoid it in [the] future.”18 Wellesley’s apprenticeship in arms continued as he followed his brother to India and gained a solid reputation with his “sepoy” victories at Seringapatam (where he was not even in command) and Assaye.</em></p>

Wellesley was a hard worker, and showed (like Napoleon) that the great generals in modern times must also have a talent for hard intellectual work that is not always glamorous. However, Wellesley had significant obstacles to overcome in finally being appointed as the overall commander of British forces in Spain. He was neither esteemed by the head of the British army, the Duke of York, nor, for that matter, by King George III. Wellesley had to prove himself worthy as opportunities came his way and he made the most of every one of them. Now, at the head of 14,000 troops in Portugal his time had come, but he had to hurry. There were two British officers senior to him who could supersede him at any moment, Generals Burrard and Dalyrymple.</em></p>

<p><em>As long as the guerillas had sanctuaries and supplies, they could fight. The larger the sanctuary, the larger the insurgent force. Thus, Wellesley’s Anglo-Portuguese army was not the only conventional force fighting compound warfare in Spain, numerous conventional Spanish armies were, too, for the entire period up through 1813. If we understand this dynamic, it will help us understand why Wellesley, with armies generally no larger than 40,000 men, was rarely opposed by larger French armies, despite the French having over 250,000 troops in the Peninsula at the height of the war in 1811.28 Thus, keeping all these factors in mind, the Napoleonic operational way of war, as we have described it, proved unsuited to compound war in Spain. It was designed for rapid maneuver with overwhelming force and firepower, using decisive battle to scatter and demoralize its foes, and relying on short campaigns to overcome the logistical challenges of feeding the large numbers of troops required for this approach. Like the Americans 160 years later in Vietnam, it would win just about every battle but lose the war. One can compare the North Vietnamese army to the conventional British, Portuguese, and Spanish forces and the Viet Cong to the guerilla bands. French logistics collapsed in Spain, while the watery highways off its coasts ensured a logistical flow to their enemies. Poor roads, poor weather, and an agrarian base that could barely feed itself much less foraging troops undermined the French ability to maneuver rapidly at the operational level. Thus, the French found they could advance rapidly to an objective, only to run out of supplies when they got there. It was either withdraw or starve for many a French operation. Additionally, the problems with food and logistics often prevented them from massing for the same reason, as soon as two or more corps concentrated in a small area of real estate, the French found themselves unable to feed everyone. Finally, as mentioned in chapter 5, Napoleon made all the important operational decisions for the main theater of war.</em></p>

<p><em>With Soult presumably removed from active operations for the foreseeable future, Wellesley turned his attention to the corps of Marshal Victor threatening to invade Portugal along the line of the Tagus River from Spain. Wellesley had left some British troops at Abrantes, although his orders from London prohibited actual operations inside Spain. Not far from there, the defeated army of the Spanish general Don Gregorio Cuesta attempted to recover after its disastrous defeat earlier that year at Medellin.38 Wellesley obtained permission to join with Cuesta for an offensive down the Tagus toward Toledo and Madrid. It is not clear if Wellesley aimed at a spoiling operation to further prevent an invasion of Portugal that year (1809). But his purpose included developing a military relationship with his Spanish allies and a joint offensive might help their cause in many ways elsewhere in Spain.39 The campaign that summer proved an education for all concerned. Wellesley hoped that the dispersed nature of the French forces facing him might give Allied arms a reasonable chance for an operational success. Also, the Fifth Coalition seemed to be winning its war against Napoleon, especially given Napoleon’s recent defeat on the Danube in May at the Battle of Aspern-Essling.40 Cuesta had approximately 30,000 troops, although of varying quality in both soldiers and leaders, and another Spanish army of 20,000 faced General Sebastiani’s corps in La Mancha. Wellesley did not reckon that the corps of Ney, Mortier, and especially Soult in northern Spain could provide any aid to Victor and Sebastiani who guarded King Joseph (now in Madrid again). All told, the Allies theoretically faced 50,000 French with 80,000 Anglo-Spanish troops that included 25,000 veteran British soldiers, fresh from a recent victory. But Wellesley did not count on the pride and jealousy of his Spanish allies. He also learned, to his dismay, that the Spanish promises to support him logistically were empty and he almost cancelled the campaign on these grounds alone. The elderly Cuesta did not want to take orders from a young British general (Wellesley had just turned 40) and wanted to capture Toledo and possibly Madrid, often ignoring Wellesley’s advice. One moment he was all caution, the next rash. Worse, the army facing Sebastiani failed to pursue that general when he left a small rearguard and came west to reinforce Victor. King Joseph, meanwhile, ordered the three corps of Mortier, Soult and Ney (under Soult’s command) to abandon Galicia and cut off the Anglo-Spanish retreat to Portugal. A potential disaster was in the making. 41 By July 23, the Anglo-Spanish army had come as far as Talavera where it caught up to Victor. That marshal wisely retreated to the east to join forces with King Joseph’s small reserve and Sebastiani’s corps. By the end of the month, Wellesley had established a defensive position at Talavera as Cuesta had advanced alone against the French. Cuesta soon learned he faced an army of 46,000 veteran French soldiers under Marshal Victor who had already beaten him earlier that year at Medellin. He promptly fell back and joined Wellesley at Talavera.</em></p>

<p><em>As Wellington brought his sullen and underfed army back to Portugal, he pondered the operational lessons he had learned: that coordination with the Spanish proved difficult and that he must have absolute command over the forces under him; that he must carefully arrange for his logistics as he advanced through the famished interior of Spain; that he must secure his flanks; and that his army could not remain long in the Peninsula if it engaged in the sort of slugfests that Napoleon and his marshals were willing to fight. He innately recognized that the contest in the Peninsula depended on continued support from back home and the steady application of pressure from a position of strength, in short that operating on the strategic defensive was probably his best course of action for the future—fighting a campaign of “erosion,” or attrition. He also learned of Napoleon’s triumph on the Danube at the hellish Battle of Wagram, the bloodiest battle in European history since Lepanto (1571). He knew well enough that he needed all his skill and luck to face the coming storm in 1810 as new French forces would surely be diverted to Spain to cure once and for all the “Spanish Ulcer.”44</em></p>

<p><em>Charles had tried to implement reforms prior to the War of the Third Coalition, but had been stymied in many of his suggestions, although he and Mack had managed to at least formalize the use of the combined arms division. They also, at the last minute, had established a formal, permanent general staff.47 However, more was needed and the “polyglot” Empire of Austria was forced to take some of the measures taken by the French in order to once again challenge the French. The first and probably least successful reform involved conscription, which proved difficult for the Austrians given the wide spectrum of nationalities. They had medieval-era militia levies that could be called out in extreme emergencies—the Ban of Croatia and the Insurrectio of Hungary—but these were essentially untrained levies and cumbersome to activate. They played no great role in the campaign of 1809, although they might have had the war continued into another season.48 What Charles did do was increase the size of the regular army and create a limited trained militia, the Landwehr, from the German-speaking provinces in Austria. These came about 40,000 strong and contributed 15,000 troops for use along the Danube.</em></p>

<p><em>More important were the organizational changes that Charles implemented. These included creating, as had Napoleon, artillery and cavalry reserves for use both tactically and operationally. In addition, he increased the artillery to more than 700 guns and would have superiority in this arm over Napoleon during the campaign. Charles concentrated the control of this numerous artillery at the higher echelons of brigade up to the army level. Charles intended to offset French élan and numbers with fire power. Another French innovation the Austrians adopted was the combined arms corps, which included cavalry, artillery, infantry, and engineers. Charles additionally beefed up the Quartermaster General Staff (QMGS). The QMGS included talented officers like Josef Radetzky, whom the Emperor appointed chief of staff in 1809. Charles also oversaw the professionalization of his logistics service, making their leaders commissioned officers in the Imperial Army. In the area of doctrine, Charles adopted French skirmishing tactics, including them in the field regulations and substantially increased the number of independent light infantry (jaeger) battalions. He also created a new tactical formation known as the “mass” composed of two companies that could advance rapidly on the battlefield prior to forming line and in doing so could defend itself reasonably well against cavalry attacks. This gave the Austrian army a new level of tactical mobility on the battlefield that proved a surprise to the French in 1809.</em></p>

<p><em>Charles’s plan seemed to have been the same, to attack Napoleon’s forces as they attempted to cross the river. However, with French forces in possession of a crossing further down the river at Pressburg, Napoleon employed operational deception to get the jump on Charles in crossing the river. Charles’s key mistake after Aspern-Essling was his failure to assault Lobau and prevent its use by the French, since the Danube at that location was narrower and easy to bridge. On July 3–4, Napoleon began to increase the sizable forces he already had garrisoning Lobau, screening his movements with a squadron of gunboats that both protected his crossing and denied the Austrians both intelligence as well as their efforts to break the bridges to Lobau. Charles was fooled into thinking Napoleon would cross at Pressburg, but these forces, including Eugene, countermarched up the river for the crossing at Lobau. By July 3, Charles knew Napoleon would probably cross from Lobau, but even there he could not be sure where to meet Napoleon’s forces given that Napoleon had occupied a number of smaller adjacent islands from which he could easily reach the north bank of the Danube. This is precisely what Napoleon did, choosing to cross the new bridges located in a different part of Lobau on July 4–5 (with a prepared floating pontoon bridge) instead of debauching on the old Aspern-Essling battlefield. Aside from covering forces, Charles decided not to contest the crossing and pulled back into a nearly 10-mile defensive position on the heights north of the broad Marchfeld plain. The subsequent Battle of Wagram on July 5–6 was a two-day affair between Napoleon’s 189,000 troops and 488 guns and Charles’s 136,200 supported by 446 cannon. It played out as a brutal slugfest, with artillery becoming the primary weapon of death. Never had Europe seen such an artillery barrage in its history. By the end of the second day, Napoleon had persevered through sheer, brute attrition. The Austrian cavalry reserve, decimated in the first phase of the campaign played no great role, with remounts having been hard to obtain. Overall losses for both sides were appalling, 32,000 French casualties and 40,000 Austrian, many of these from giant batteries Napoleon emplaced close to the Austrian lines to blow holes in them. Charles fell back and agreed to an armistice that allowed Napoleon a chance to recover from his bloody “victory.” Francis, meanwhile toyed with the idea of continuing the fight from further east in Hungary since the Tyrol remained unpacified and the British had invaded Holland. Worse, he removed Charles from command, but had no one of equal talent to replace him with. By October, though, he had lost hope and signed a humiliating treaty (Pressburg) that stripped Austria of even more territory, made her a military ally of the French, and reduced her army to a maximum of 150,000 soldiers. Napoleon subsequently married Francis’s daughter Marie-Louise in 1810 to seal the deal of the new Franco-Austrian entente and to secure an heir after divorcing Josephine.</em></p>

<p><em>The period 1808–1809 witnessed war and politics on a scale and variety not seen in Europe since the time of Charles V or the Roman Empire. However, the canvas for Napoleon’s masterpieces, to recall our metaphor, had grown too large, and his method had been copied and improved upon by the other great generals of the era. Napoleon’s adversaries, who had long studied his methods, soon came into their own—excepting Wellington, who had already arrived. Napoleon, although still learning, was learning less quickly. Politically he seemed in a somewhat better position in 1810, but the war still raged in Spain and Great Britain, mistress of the seas, remained actively bellicose. Russia, which had remained guardedly neutral in 1809, soon openly rebelled against Napoleon’s “antieconomic” Continental System. Napoleon’s ruinous strategy against Britain was soon to make the specter of a two-front war permanent.</em></p>

<p><em>Nations in arms, army groups, combined arms organization, tactics at all echelons, and massive fire power—by the end of 1809 all these things were in place on “both sides of the aisle” during the Napoleonic Wars. However, this study contends that, despite 17 years of nonstop conflict, Napoleonic warfare only became “total war” in 1810. Certainly, total war in the sense we use it today includes all the factors mentioned in the first sentence.1 Allied strategists and generals unknowingly applied Hans Delbrück’s strategies of attrition, using protracted conflict to wear their enemies down—in this case Napoleon and his French-led armies. Wellington had already outlined such a strategy before returning to Spain. In 1810, with a massive invasion of Portugal looming, he put into place the operational framework for protracted attritional warfare, policies, and actions, which may be termed absolute or total, by his troops in concert with irregular forces. Consistent with Delbrück, and reflecting the wisdom of Clausewitz that weaker powers must take advantage of the defense as the stronger form of war, Wellington showed the way in his 1810–1811 campaign in Portugal by using combat power, not for the offensive, but for the strategic and operational defensive as a means to sap the strength of an army of potentially 100,000 men invading Portugal. Similarly, when Napoleon made his disastrous decision to invade Russia and solve the problem to his east once and for all, the Russians, less deliberately, stumbled into the power of the strategic defense as a means of exhausting the enemy. In both of these hellish campaigns—Portugal and Russia—geography played an immense role in the operational framework. But they shared these commonalties of defense, protracted resistance and retreat with a goal of “erosion,” as Wellington named it, of the adversaries’ larger forces.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon seemingly triumphed in 1809—both in Spain and against Austria. Yet, Great Britain remained at war while the Napoleonic system in Europe and a cruel compound war in Spain and Portugal simmered on. The Napoleonic system still had some triumphs left to it in Spain, but not against Lord Wellington. Wellington grimly committed himself to a strategic defensive, ignoring the pleas of his Spanish allies to join them in yet another round of fruitless offensives against the French forces occupying the key central position in Spain. His experiences in the unsatisfactory Talavera campaign and the defeat of the Austrians at Wagram convinced him of this necessity and he advised his Allies to remain on the defensive and husband their strength. He withdrew to Abrantes in Portugal to prepare for an invasion army that might have Napoleon at its head.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s assessment of Masséna’s challenge must be examined against Wellington’s intricate plans for the defense of Portugal and an anticipated invasion by as many as 100,000 French troops. Thanks to Soult and King Joseph he would deal with considerably fewer than that. Also, thanks to these other Spanish adventures and Napoleon’s odd attention deficit when it came to the Anglo-British forces on his flank, Wellington had been given almost a year to prepare for the invasion. Wellington’s plan had four major components: creation of a suitable Portuguese regular army to augment the British; construction of a line of defenses from the broad Tagus to the Atlantic; training and equipping of the ancient Portuguese militia—the Ordenanza—for use against French communications to Spain; and, finally, the complete devastation and depopulation of the Portuguese countryside. This last served as a means to deny the French any ability to use their logistical practice of foraging their troops on the countryside and sequestering village stores.</em></p>

<p><em>was absolutely necessary before even limited offensive operations could be conducted inside Spain. Here the result was less fortuitous. Soult marched rapidly to relieve Badajoz and almost defeated Beresford’s Anglo-Spanish-Portuguese army by again employing a flanking attack. The Spaniards, ably commanded by General Javier Castanos, held their own and a timely counterattack by the British Fusilier Brigade retrieved the situation, but losses on both sides were extremely heavy—8,000 (approximately 33%) for the French and 6,000 (approximately 18%) for the Allies, especially among the British (nearly 50%)—one of the heaviest loss rates of the Napoleonic wars. Badajoz, however, was resupplied and the British siege collapsed. Wellington never let Beresford command independently in combat again after this Pyrrhic victory.15 With these two battles, Wellington’s war in Spain gave way to a stalemate that centered on the two French-held fortresses of Badajoz and Ciudad Rodrigo. Whenever Wellington tried to invest these places, the French—Marmont and Soult—combined and confronted his forces, usually using the great bridge across the Tagus at Almaraz for lateral movement. Wellington resorted to a lengthy cat and mouse game for the rest of 1811, hoping for a French error. In the meantime, Napoleon continued to pull troops from Spain, weakening his forces further.</em></p>

<p><em>Throughout all of 1811 and the first part of 1812, the two sides built up their forces and prepared diplomatically for the expected “clash of the titans.” Napoleon’s preparations were on a gargantuan scale and by the spring of 1812 he had deployed over 449,000 troops in cantonments along the Vistula River in Poland.22 His alliance included the military forces of just about every dominion under his direct and indirect influence, including sizable contingents from both Austria and Prussia. Neither of these contingents can be categorized as “willing” and it is to Napoleon’s great discredit as a strategist and general that he had the bad judgment to place them on his northern and southern flanks to guard the advance of his central army group. The final break came effectively in April, when the Tsar presented Napoleon with an ultimatum to evacuate Prussia and return the Duchy of Oldenburg. This was tantamount to a declaration of war since it meant that Napoleon must also abandon the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Adding injury to insult, the Tsar signed a treaty with Sweden, which freed further troops for use against Napoleon. Once Napoleon invaded, the Tsar’s representatives in Great Britain also signed a treaty of alliance with that nation, although British goods were already flowing into Russian ports. However, Russia would not lack for funds to help pay for the war.23 The plans and deployments of the French and Russians for this campaign reflect best, perhaps, the style of mobilization and operational components envisioned by the Soviet operational theorists like Isserson and Tukhachevsky 120 years later in the Soviet Union.24 Russia’s vast size seems to bring this sort of gigantic military effort out, no matter the age and the technological sophistication. We will turn first to Napoleon’s plans and deployments prior to the invasion. Napoleon cannot be faulted for failing to mobilize his vast resources. He even tried to broker a peace in Spain with Great Britain in order to simplify the task at hand, although this too-little, too-late initiative failed.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s first strategic echelon consisted of the bulk of the reconstituted Grande Armée, with the enlarged Imperial Guard (nearly 50,000) under his personal command. In addition were two armies commanded by his relatives, one under his step-son Prince Eugene Beauharnais, the Viceroy of Italy, and the other under his brother Jerome, King of Westphalia. These three armies constituted the central army group, also under Napoleon’s operational command, and might be considered the first army group of the modern era. This army group numbered 383,000 troops and 1,022 artillery pieces. Nearly half of this force was composed of nonnative French troops: Dutch, Swiss, Poles, Italians, Spanish, Portuguese, Croatians, and Germans from the Confederation of the Rhine.</em></p>

<p><em>The second strategic echelon consisted of troops still forming up to be used as replacements for those in the first echelon. They consisted of about 165,000 soldiers, many of them in Marshal Victor’s IX Corps and included many Polish and German troops. The third strategic echelon amounted to about 60,000 troops and included the corps of Marshal Augereau, two of whose divisions were in the second echelon with Victor, as well as various garrisons in Poland. We might consider that a fourth strategic echelon existed in the remainder of the empire encompassing the National Guard, fortress garrisons and posts along the Atlantic coast (not including the Peninsula), the Danish Army and a virtual levée en masse for any French males not already serving between the ages of 20 and 26. These constituted something less than 275,000 men, but Napoleon was relying on further exactions from his allies—especially the Germans—and new troops to be raised in “liberated” areas of Russian Poland and Lithuania should he need troops for an unexpected crisis.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Napoleon’s logistical preparations to support this plan made sense had the campaign turned out as he planned. Although his troops would be required to forage in some cases, he had large amounts of biscuit, grain, and mobile ovens created to support his armies. Also, his line of advance, and indeed his initial penetration into Russia at Kovno at the juncture of the Nieman and Vilia Rivers, was intended to take advantage of those two streams to support the main line of his advance to Vilna (see map 24). The weak link in the entire system of logistics, especially if the campaign did not develop along the nice, neat lines he hoped for, involved distributing the food to the immense army from river debarkation points and supply convoys. The means to do this involved using draught animals and these animals in turn needed as to be maintained and fed. Thus, a key problem might arise if the Russian army managed to escape to the east of Vilna without an engagement. Napoleon would be forced to choose between two options. The first required spending the precious weeks of good campaigning weather establishing a new line of logistical support using rivers and the Baltic toward St. Petersburg or, more likely, along the Dvina and Dnieper (Dnepr) rivers toward Smolensk. The second option would be to outstrip his logistical support by rapid marching of his troops on either line of Russian retreat in the hopes of catching them, while foraging as a stopgap measure. This last choice was risky, and Napoleon knew of it based on his previous experience in 1806–1807. Finally, the assumption of good weather during the Russian summer did not account for an extremely dry, hot continental summer.</em></p>

<p><em>However, other than Eugene (and not all historians agree on this point), Napoleon had done little to develop the habit of independent command in his subordinates. Some had demonstrated this talent earlier in their careers (Masséna) or as a result of accident and moral courage (Davout).36 Thus, although Napoleon created a de facto army group to help solve this situation, he had to command the army under his personal command, too (which was initially 222,000 men strong). Additionally, he treated Jerome, Eugene, Macdonald, and Schwarzenberg as he did the corps commanders under his direct control instead of trusting them (although perhaps he trusted Macdonald too much). Thus, he overburdened himself and his staff in trying to command and control at so many levels. Often his orders, if they arrived at all through the Cossack-infested country, arrived well after the situation had changed and only contributed to hesitation and confusion by his subordinates rather than adding value. The size of war had grown beyond the Emperor’s means to effectively control all its many parts, despite his computer-like brain and astonishing work ethic. He was older now and his capacity for work had atrophied as had his physical condition since 1809. Napoleon’s endurance had declined just as he began a campaign that would test him mentally and physically more than any other he had conducted.</em></p>

The Russians were hustled out of Krasny, fighting desperately against Murat as they withdrew in a divisional square toward Smolensk. Fortunately, the slow speed of Bagration’s advance, in part due to his concern over the open left flank at Smolensk, allowed him to throw General Raievsky’s nearby corps (17,000) into Smolensk, preventing Murat and his supporting infantry from capturing it outright on the following day.

In contrast, the evidence presented suggests that army was already defeated when it marched into Moscow and doomed as it marched out. Kutuzov’s army slowly increased in size until it outnumbered Napoleon’s—by October it numbered approximately 100,000 troops.</em></p>

<p><em>Where were Napoleon’s operational reserves, including the supposedly fresh corps of Victor? These forces were fighting for their lives and also retreating. Wittgenstein and Tshitshagov advanced from the north and south, respectively, toward the Beresina River to cut off Napoleon’s retreat (see map 28). Here a brief flash of Napoleonic brilliance occurred as he defeated Tshitshagov and bluffed Wittgenstein from 25 to 29 November. Kutusov, now seriously ill (he would die in the spring of 1813), hung back with the main army, satisfied to let Napoleon leave Russia without risking a defeat. Victor’s still-intact corps and Oudinot’s bloodied one united with the main army and did most of the fighting. However, as at Krasny, once the disciplined core of what was left of Napoleon’s “army group” crossed the Beresina, tens of thousands of stragglers were cut off and fell into enemy hands. According to Clausewitz: “Chance certainly somewhat favored Bonaparte…but it was his reputation which chiefly saved him, and he traded in this instance on a capital amassed long before.”69 Some accounts list as many as 30,000 stragglers—no longer fighting but struggling to avoid dying of starvation, exposure, or both—falling into Russian hands. David Chandler estimated the losses as coming to perhaps 50,000 to 60,000, including many who drowned or froze in the frigid river. Napoleon stayed with the army until December 5 and then departed at Smorgoni for Paris to quell conspiracies, propagate the myth that the Russian winter had defeated him, and prepare for the worst, turning over what was left to Murat.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon had good reason to believe that he might return to Poland instead of several hundred miles further west. He could theoretically field more troops than the Russians, some 190,000. Napoleon’s instructions to Murat, in command once the Emperor departed after crossing the Beresina, were to defend along the Niemen if possible.22 However, the balance of troops in this total came from the Prussian and Austrian contingents—Murat’s strength derived from the corps of two former enemies. If we subtract Yorck’s 17,000 and Schwarzenberg’s 25,000 troops from Napoleon’s forces, the French Imperial forces for defense totaled 148,000, including those in garrisons. Napoleon, enraged by Yorck’s action and underestimating the duplicity of the Austrians, further compounded his shortage of veteran manpower by directing Murat and his successor Prince Eugene to leave major fortresses garrisoned as the French gave up ground in their retreat west.23 Instead of gaining power as they collapsed on their lines of communications, the French lost strength.</em></p>

<p><em>The 1813 campaign up to this point had been one of operational pursuit. The frozen rivers of Germany provided Prince Eugene, now in command, no defensible barriers. He fought delaying actions as best he could as Germany exploded into revolt around his tired and demoralized troops. However, he was helped in no small measure by Kutuzov’s lackluster pursuit. The Allied forces consisted of three field armies: one to the north under the Russian general Wittgenstein, one in Silesia under General Blücher, and the main Russian army under Kutuzov still in Poland (see map 29). Wittgenstein’s army included his own corps and Yorck’s Prussians—about 50,000 men. Blücher’s army included a Russian corps under General Winzingerode. Other Prussian corps under Generals Friedrich von Bülow and Friedrich von Kleist were forming but not yet ready for operations.26 The Allies planned the liberation of as much of Germany as possible, which by April meant as far west as the Elbe River. Here Kutuzov wanted to stop. In the meantime, Wittgenstein conducted a flank march along the Elbe to join Blücher who had captured Dresden. Eugene attacked Wittgenstein near Mockern, which threatened to upset the Allied plans to concentrate. However, after this indecisive combat Eugene withdrew and informed Napoleon of his intention to abandon the upper Elbe and retreat as far as the more defensible Saale River.</em></p>

<p><em>The Battle of Lützen resulted from Napoleon’s resumed offensive. Napoleon’s plan was to incur a battle or induce the Allies to retreat across the Elbe, either of which he was convinced would give the initiative and momentum back to him. To do this he planned to turn the Allied position by making “a movement exactly the opposite of the one I carried through during the Jena campaign” by marching on Leipzig then down the Elbe behind the Allies to Dresden.33 The Russo-Prussian army surprised Ney’s isolated corps south of Lützen at the little village of Gross Görschen on May 2 (see map 30). Ney managed to hold on until Napoleon arrived with the bulk of his army of 110,000 men versus the 73,000 of the Allies. The Allied assumption that their veterans might provide the edge over Napoleon’s conscripts proved incorrect and Napoleon forced his opponents to retreat. Each side lost approximately 20,000 casualties. Napoleon was unable to fully capitalize on his tactical success due to his paucity of cavalry. As if to underscore this deficiency Blücher led a furious cavalry counterattack that stopped the French pursuit cold and served as a postscript to this bloody battle. In reference to the fighting abilities of the Prussian, Napoleon allegedly muttered, “These animals have learned something.” Unfortunately, Scharnhorst received a wound in the foot and died of blood poisoning some weeks later after turning over his duties as overall Prussian chief of staff to the capable Gneisenau.</em></p>

<p><em>The line of operations remained along the Austrian frontier and a defensive position was chosen in the foothills of the Bohemian mountains adjacent to the town of Bautzen from which to impede Napoleon’s advance. Napoleon employed a classic operational manoeuvre sur les derrières against this position. His goal was to fix the Russo-Prussian army with his main army while Marshal Ney, whom he had dispatched to the north to threaten Berlin, moved south with two corps to arrive in the Allies’ rear. Ney, or more probably his chief of staff Baron Jomini, directed all four corps (80,000 troops) against the Allied flank and rear at Bautzen. This fortunate accident was offset by Jomini’s orders to the corps to march along the same route in column, thus limiting the coup de grâce to one narrow line of approach to the Allied vulnerable right flank commanded by the intelligent and resourceful Barclay de Tolly.36</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 258 (location ~ 3951-3957)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In the aftermath, recriminations on the French side ran deep and Marshal Berthier preferred charges against Jomini (but not Ney). Jomini, in a huff, deserted to the Allies where the Tsar added him to his growing group of personal military advisors.38 On the Allied side, Wittgenstein lost his job to Barclay de Tolly, whose conduct during the battle had earned him the laurels he long deserved. On the northern front, Napoleon peeled off another army under Marshal Oudinot to capture Berlin, a prerequisite to advancing to the Oder and relieving the French garrisons there. Oudinot’s opponent was General Bülow who now had a sizable corps, well-armed with British equipment flowing through the Baltic and Hamburg. Oudinot and Bülow fought each other to a stalemate in the plains and forests southeast of Berlin, their last engagement occurring at Luckau on June 4. Thus, at the end of May, the Allies seemed to be in hopeless shape, their main forces had retreated into Silesia with Napoleon in pursuit and another force had narrowly averted the capture of Berlin. In the words of one observer the Allies were “absolutely in a cul de sac.” Additionally, the coalition itself seemed in danger of breaking up over the issue of in which direction to retreat.39 However, Napoleon’s new Grande Armée had no more offensive power left, being composed of many young recruits with little training and almost devoid of effective cavalry. Napoleon had robbed “Peter to pay Paul” by weakening his Spanish armies and had no more operational reserves on hand to finish the campaign. On June 4 at Pleischwitz the representatives of Napoleon and the Allies signed a cease-fire which later resulted in an armistice that was to last most of the summer. Why had Napoleon, on the verge of trapping the Allied armies in Silesia, settled for an operational pause? He explained it as, “lack of cavalry…and the hostile position of Austria.” Napoleon’s army was just as exhausted as the Allies and his experience in Russia had taught him the dangers of a protracted campaign beyond the capabilities of his army.40 To fully understand Napoleon’s problems we must address the other aspects of this campaign that had contributed to the French exhaustion. The first of these, the problem of the fortresses Napoleon left along the Allied lines of communication, is disposed of rather quickly, but its bearing on Napoleon’s problems is part of the entire mosaic. Napoleon’s tasks for his fortresses were threefold: they were to tie down Allied forces; interrupt their lines of communication; and finally, because most of them were at major road and bridge centers, facilitate his own rapid movement when he advanced eastward. As far as the first task the reverse situation was true, Stewart remarks that the French garrisons were “nearly double the blockading force.”41 Not only did the Allies mask these fortresses with minimal forces but also the troops used were often the least trained. These fortresses interfered relatively little with the Allied lines of communications during the critical period when the French withdrew for the reason that most of the rivers were frozen, rendering the bridges located at the fortresses irrelevant. By the time the rivers had thawed, the front was far to the west and the Allies had opened up new lines of support for their armies. Additionally, Napoleon’s line of operations in the spring, in pursuit of the main Allied army, took him south from most of the fortresses.</em></p>

<p><em>The second set of operations involved the employment of numerous Cossacks, partisans, and friekorps by the Allies against Napoleon’s communications. One Napoleonic historian credited these operations with shifting a balance of some 53,000 troops away from the French main forces for a cost of approximately 5,000 troops, mostly Cossacks. Their effect contributed measurably to Napoleon’s operational problems. The first phase of these operations was an outgrowth of the way in which the Russians had been employing their Cossacks all along. Wittgenstein initiated these operations, which were a response to a request by emissaries of the Hanse cities and Eugene’s withdrawal across the Elbe.43 The initial raid, by a mixed force of regular Russian cavalry, Cossacks, and expatriate Germans, succeeded beyond the Allies’ wildest dreams. Its commander, Colonel Tettenborn, boldly advanced into Mecklenburg to secure the safety of Swedish Pomerania and gain the allegiance of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin to the Allied cause.</em></p>

<p><em>Two areas that superficially appear less mature than the others discussed are operational vision and instantaneous command and control (C2). Instantaneous C2 is the more problematic of the two. The only medium of “instant” communications was that of the shared vision of the participants. All wanted to fight the French, hurt them as much as possible, and ostensibly liberate Germany. This led to an environment that favored commanders willing to make independent decisions. Such rapid decision-making in response to opportunities yielded the most fruit in the deep operations along the Elbe and in Napoleon’s rear. As for operational vision, the Allies were hurt by the deaths of Kutuzov and Scharnhorst, particularly Scharnhorst if we are to believe Müffling, Clausewitz, and Gneisenau. But we catch a glimpse of Scharnhorst’s operational vision as we see the product of his creativity in action—the mobilization and performance of the Prussian army.51 The survival and will to fight of the coalition army after Lützen and Bautzen and the shared vision remaining in force after Scharnhorst died provide further evidence. Perhaps the true measure of operational vision is the ability to pass it along to one’s peers and subordinates, rather than merely to rely on electronic communication. We must also recognize that the coalition itself had improved and was improving.52 The effort the Sixth Coalition expended in maintaining its unity was unique for the Napoleonic Wars. Blücher’s willing subordination to Wittgenstein is but one example. Even the choice of the line of operation, south away from the threatened capital of Berlin, was a departure from the classical strategy of the past. It would be like Kutuzov retreating toward Kiev instead of Moscow after the battle of Borodino. The signing of the armistice in June 1813, too, has a modern flavor. The Allies could well have kept fighting, which might have kept Austria out of the war, or done as Austria did after Wagram and negotiated an unfavorable peace. Instead they chose the best solution, an operational pause in the form of a cease-fire and then armistice.

<p><em>One must also give “the God of War” his due.53 Napoleon was learning new ways of war, despite his ongoing search for the decisive battle that ended the campaign. The battle of Bautzen provides the best evidence of Napoleon fighting in a distributed fashion and further evidence of his continued mastery of operational maneuver. Napoleon, like Robert E. Lee at Chancellorsville, assigned himself the job of fixing the Allies, while Ney delivered the coup de grâce from the flank with another entire army. Napoleon had been effectively fighting as an army group commander since Russia and this campaign shows that his sophistication at maneuvering armies was increasing despite the degradation of his tools. Finally, Napoleon recognized that he must respond to the operational threat to his rear and flanks, another lesson from Russia. The Emperor allotted his precious cavalry and arguably his most capable marshal to these tasks. However, Napoleon’s own distributed efforts against the Allied rear failed primarily because of the sophistication of the Allies’ response.</em></p>

<p><em>The advent of Austria as an active belligerent against Napoleon was by far the most important development during the armistice. Ironically, this goal, and many Gneisenau listed, was shared by Austria’s foreign minister Clemens von Metternich who commented upon the armistice as follows: “An Armistice will be the greatest of blessings…it will give us an opportunity to get to know each other, to concert military measures with the Allies and to bring reinforcements to the most threatened points.”56 From this quotation it appears that Austria’s participation was a forgone conclusion. However, as Charles Stewart observed, “It is difficult to give an adequate idea of the anxiety that prevailed [on the part of Great Britain, Russia, and Prussia]…with respect to the decision of Austria.”57 Metternich’s master, Francis I, was not as committed to war with Napoleon as his minister and hoped that the armistice might give Austrian diplomacy the opportunity to negotiate a lasting peace. The terms to establish a peace comprised: the return of Illyria (the Dalmatian coast) to Austria, the territorial aggrandizement of Prussia via the dissolution of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, the break-up of the Confederation of the Rhine, and the reestablishment of France’s eastern boundary along the Rhine. The acceptance of these terms by Napoleon would have guaranteed Austrian neutrality and certainly freed Germany geographically from French influence. On June 26, 1813, Metternich had presented these terms to Napoleon at Dresden and was rudely rebuffed; Napoleon would accept the Illyrian concession only. Metternich departed Dresden convinced that peace with Napoleon was not possible.</em></p>

<p><em>Radetzky explained his plan to the British envoy Sir Robert Wilson as a “system of defense combined with offensive operations on a small scale over a general offensive movement which might win much, but also might lose all.”74 Radetzky modified the Trachenberg Convention in the following important ways. First, the plan he received predicted an immediate offensive by Napoleon toward Bohemia. It therefore directed Bernadotte to energetically advance south and combine with Blücher to form a second army in Napoleon’s rear of about 120,000 men. This was done to make Bernadotte happy but Radetzky wanted three independent field armies operating against Napoleon until he could be engaged with a clear superiority (presumably by the Bohemian army group). Secondly, no allied army would go on the offensive against Napoleon initially. Neither of the two smaller armies was to engage him, but rather retreat energetically, causing French forces to make forced marches in pursuit. This meant that the Allies would react to Napoleon’s movements as they employed a strategy of exhaustion, making his forces march and countermarch until battle could be accepted on favorable terms. It ceded to Napoleon his favorite principle of war—initiative. However, the Austrians intended to use Napoleon’s strength against him, to have him spend his initiative and energy on the offensive, thereby reaching, as he had in Russia, a culminating point of victory far from France, resources exhausted, and surrounded by hostile armies.</em></p>

<p><em>The Sixth Coalition’s leaders created military history’s first modern operations order for a multinational army group. There were other inputs that affected the plan’s operational execution. General Jean Moreau, one of the Tsar’s many advisors, for example, advised: “Expect a defeat whenever the Emperor attacks in person. Attack and fight his lieutenants whenever you can. Once they are beaten, assemble all your forces against Napoleon and give him no respite.”76 Jomini, now one of the Tsar’s aides, cautioned against underestimating Napoleon—stating that he remained “the ablest of men.”77</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s Grande Armée of August 1813 was a more potent force than the one he had marched and fought to exhaustion in the spring. His Imperial Guard and cavalry had been reconstituted by extraordinary efforts, especially by the expedient of denuding the armies in Spain. Napoleon’s artillery was also numerous and excellently served (often by former sailors)—but not nearly as mobile. However, his army remained overwhelmingly young—two-thirds of his troops were between 18 and 20 years of age. About 90,000 of these troops would be on the sick lists before hostilities began.80 The many foreign troops, especially Germans, exacerbated these factors because they composed a significant number of Napoleon’s veterans. Napoleon compounded his problems by apportioning the majority of these German troops to his flank forces, just as he had in Russia. These forces predominantly opposed fellow Germans instead of the more ethnically diverse force of the Bohemian army. Finally, Napoleon was forced by circumstance to employ the best of his remaining independent commanders elsewhere: Eugene in Italy, Soult and Suchet in Spain, and Davout holding the lower Elbe. The only exception was Marshal St. Cyr, who kept guard at Dresden. One more command arrangement must be discussed before proceeding to the operations—the Prussian General Staff system. Although the Prussians commanded the numerically smallest of the field armies, they wielded a significant operational influence across the coalition.</em></p>

<p><em>Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr faced the Allies at Dresden. He had earned his marshal’s baton in Russia at Polotsk fighting just the type of battle the Allies now contemplated. Allied skirmishers had already found Dresden’s walled houses and gardens fortified for the impending attack. As the initial combat into these fortified suburbs began, Napoleon dramatically arrived. With Napoleon’s arrival the mood at headquarters rapidly changed and Moreau advised Alexander to withdraw. The Prussian King uncharacteristically asserted himself and urged that the attack continue. While the supreme command bickered, the assault went on in response to orders already issued. The result was a defeat for the coalition as Napoleon crushed the wings of the Bohemian army group. Already half-beaten, the Allies compounded their mistake and fought a second day until forced to withdraw on August 27. Their losses were significant: 38,000 Austrians, Prussians, and Russians were casualties, including many prisoners, versus 10,000 French casualties.88 Dresden was the exception that proved the rule. The Reichenbach plan had not intended an offensive battle against Napoleon and his main force by one army—particularly against a defensive position like Dresden. The Allied leaders, partially as a result of the ponderous command process of the Bohemian army, diverted in spirit from the agreed plan, and fought Napoleon on his terms. Moreau, whose legs were shot off by a cannonball, tried to put a bold face on the defeat as he wrote to his wife with his dying hand, “That scoundrel Bonaparte is always fortunate…. Though the army has made a retrograde movement, it is…from want of ensemble, and in order to get nearer General Blücher.”89 The British observer Wilson was less charitable in his assessment; he called the battle “an ill-advised enterprise executed with great vigour.”</em></p>

<p><em>When Schwarzenberg’s lumbering advance on Dresden pulled Napoleon and his reserves away to assist St. Cyr, Napoleon left Marshal Macdonald in command of his own corps and three others (including Sebastiani’s cavalry corps) with strict orders not to advance beyond the Katzbach. Heedless of these instructions, Macdonald pursued Blücher beyond the Katzbach on August 27.97 It was at this time that Blücher noted a lack of aggressiveness in the French approach and pursuit, correctly deducing that Napoleon had departed. He and Gneisenau resumed the offensive in accordance with their agreement with Barclay. The result was a meeting engagement along the Katzbach, which a driving rain had swollen into a raging torrent.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>The results of the Katzbach and Grossbeeren clashes validated the Reichenbach Plan, despite the serious setback at Dresden. Local disunity in both of the smaller armies had threatened failure: Bülow’s conflict with Bernadotte and Langeron’s insubordination vis-à-vis Blücher. Nevertheless, operational unity due to general adherence to the operational framework yielded two significant victories that effectively negated the results of Dresden, just as Marmont had predicted. More victories followed. Despite the pounding at Dresden, the Army of Bohemia conducted a fighting withdrawal south through the forests of the Bohemian Mountains. Partly due to tenacity, and partly due to luck, a victory was obtained on this front, too. After Dresden, Schwarzenberg complained bitterly to Metternich and wrote that either the Russo-Prussian Reserve Corps be placed “under my immediate orders, or someone else be entrusted with the command.” While Schwarzenberg vented to Metternich, he and Radetzky resolved to halt the French pursuit by General Vandamme that threatened to cut off major portions of the Allied army group. On August 29, at Preisten (just south of Kulm), Schwarzenberg turned and fought, sacrificing the Russian Guards in a vicious counterattack that halted Vandamme for the moment. The next day, Vandamme renewed his assault, but Kleist’s Prussian Corps, which had been cut off by Vandamme, unexpectedly debouched on the Frenchman’s rear at Kulm. Vandamme was taken prisoner and more than half his large corps annihilated or captured—crushed between Allied forces advancing both up and down the narrow valley.</em></p>

<p><em>To appreciate Napoleon’s operational problem one only need follow his movements in September. Early that month he had moved from Dresden east to Macdonald’s army to halt, and hopefully defeat, the advancing Blücher. That general reacted by conducting a fighting withdrawal, correctly assessing that Napoleon and his operational reserves were once again with Macdonald. Napoleon then proceeded again to Dresden in response to St. Cyr’s call for help against the Army of Bohemia, which was again advancing after having recovered and reorganized.</em></p>

<p><em>In previous campaigns Napoleon had usually had the advantage in operational intelligence, but not in 1813. As in the spring phase, Allied raiders wrought havoc on Napoleon’s communications, causing him to detach major formations to deal with them. A few examples suffice to illustrate that this phase of the campaign included many, if not more, of the deep operations seen earlier that year. Blücher “harassed the rear of the French Army” using the Cossacks attached to the Russian corps in his army. One enterprising Cossack leader captured an entire French infantry battalion at Wurschen on September 2. These Cossacks also provided Blücher a wealth of intelligence including the condition and intentions of the Poniatowski’s Polish corps.104 Both Stewart and Gneisenau emphasize the importance of these operations on Bernadotte’s front. They included Cossacks, raiding Freikorps, and partisan activity. One such force under General Thielmann bagged 1,300 prisoners at Weissenfels, west of the Saale River.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>A Prussian victory against a well-led French force did much to increase the momentum on the Allied side.109 Napoleon responded swiftly to this new threat. He marched on Blücher with the mass of his army, 150,000 men, leaving St. Cyr to hold Dresden with 20,000. This move exposed the instability of the relationship between Bernadotte and Blücher and also the general problem of synchronizing the movements of these massive armies. When Bernadotte learned of Napoleon’s approach, he pulled back, out of supporting distance of Blücher. Worse, Blücher had counted on Schwarzenberg to resume his offensive to distract Napoleon. The Army of Bohemia moved slowly in the south, allowing the Emperor a chance at an operational counterstroke against the now-isolated Army of Silesia. However, timely intelligence of Napoleon’s advance and excellent staff work by Gneisenau in developing a new line of operations prevented Blücher’s demise.</em></p>

<p><em>Leipzig was the largest battle in history until World War I, lasting four days and pitting Napoleon’s 180,000 troops against the Allies’ 200,000 (which grew by another 145,000 with the arrival of Bernadotte and Bennigsen on October 18).111 The Allies had 1,500 cannon, over twice Napoleon’s number. The battle was, in many ways, a microcosm of the entire fall campaign. All the elements were there on a tactical level—Blücher’s aggressive offensive into the northern suburbs around Mockern on October 16; Bernadotte’s belated advance that avoided combat the first two days of the battle; and the clash between Schwarzenberg and the Tsar over when and where to fight, finally conducting almost two distinct battles on either side of the Pleisse river, neither achieving success. The similarities were not accidental. The Allies just kept doing what they had done all along. While Schwarzenberg’s army group was attacked by the bulk of Napoleon’s army in the south and east, Blücher’s efforts in the north, along with a direct threat to Napoleon’s line of retreat by the Austrian corps of General Guylai, sealed the tactical victory by denying Napoleon the reserves he had counted on to exploit his local successes. The Army of Bohemia was pushed back, but it was not defeated. A relative lull in the battle occurred on October 17—analogous to the period of inactivity in September after Dennewitz. The Allies were content to bring up their operational reserves—the armies of Bennigsen and Bernadotte.</em></p>

<p><em>The Allied maneuvers per these plans provide evidence for a distributed operation where battle was subordinate to maneuver the majority of the time. The Allies executed in a distributed fashion as well per the plan (except at Dresden), in spite of command conflicts at the highest levels. The maneuvers of the armies along Napoleon’s flanks and rear had the effect of engaging him throughout the depth of the battlefield.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 288 (location ~ 4414-4417)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Allied operations also provide evidence of operational art using the criteria in chapter 1 due to their solution of the problem of command and control (C2). Instantaneous C2 was possible in those days on a broad front if intent was well understood and executed within the framework of a mission command philosophy of disciplined initiative. All of the armies, especially that of the fiery Blücher, displayed this trait throughout the campaign. It offered the ultimate in centralized planning and decentralized execution and had the effect of minimizing the negative aspects resulting from friction and fog in war, enabling success, and minimizing setbacks as long as the coalition’s commanders adhered to it. On a practical level, the Prussians further enhanced C2 and unity with Gneisenau’s system of chiefs of staff in the Prussian corps in the armies of Schwarzenberg and Bernadotte answering to him for the conduct of their operations.115 The Reichenbach Plan also provided the essential unity of effort that can be translated as evidence of corporate operational vision. The Allied accounts of this campaign constantly refer to actions being taken in accordance with the agreed plan of operations. Gneisenau, writing in mid-September, summarized this shared vision: “the great plan of the Allies was only ripening and the main object, of acting on the flanks of Napoleon’s army, was never lost sight of.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 289 (location ~ 4420-4431)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Instead of concentrating the major forces into one huge juggernaut à la Napoleon, the Allies broke their forces up into three independent field armies. However, this deployment did cause problems, especially with the army group operating out of Bohemia. Nowhere during the fall phase of the campaign did Allied logistics play as important a role as in Schwarzenberg’s area of operations. His careful planning for an advance through the Bohemian mountains toward Leipzig was frustrated by the Tsar and resulted in inadequate support during the advance to Dresden. On the northern front the supply situation was more in line with operational art because of the flow of British supplies from the Baltic ports across a less difficult terrain.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 290 (location ~ 4435-4440)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>In summary, the planning and execution of the fall phase of the campaign of 1813 provides evidence that attributes of operational art were not only present, but had become more sophisticated in their manifestation. The Reichenbach Plan foreshadowed the more complex operations plans of the future. It unified and simplified command and harmony by depersonalizing the operational strategy into a document approved at a political level. Above all, it subordinated engagements to a strategy of exhaustion augmenting superior strength with maneuver. Perhaps the best evidence of the Allies’ operational maturity was that their plan did achieve its objective, the defeat of the “enterprising genius” of Napoleon Bonaparte by attrition.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 291 (location ~ 4452-4457)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To a certain degree the trajectory toward the operational art went into reverse gear during the campaigns of 1814 and 1815, becoming almost 18th-century affairs when examined from the French perspective. The wars seemed to end where they started, with France surrounded on all sides and with hostile armies threatening her on all fronts, except this time there was no Valmy (see map 34). Also, the coalition he faced had a resolve hardened by the “terrible lessons” Napoleon and France had administered for over 20 years.6 In the opening days of 1814, Wellington advanced with his coalition army on a single line of operation toward Toulouse against Marshal Soult.</em></p>

<p><em>Napoleon’s defenders often imply in their work that “if only” Joseph had not panicked, Marmont had not betrayed his old friend or the marshals had remained more resolute, that Napoleon might have prevailed in retaining his throne, or perhaps getting a regency established for his son under the Empress Marie Louise. However, these speculations ignore the facts of Russian, Prussian, and British paranoia about Austria (whose Hapsburg Princess might be regent in Paris), the claims of the Bourbons, and of numbers. Also, if the Allies could survive a Borodino or a Dresden, they could certainly survive more Vauchamps and Rheims. Napoleon, on the other hand, could not survive many more La Rothieres or Laons. His campaign to exhaust the Allies’ will using the defense had failed—it failed nobly—but it had failed. There was no “miracle of the House of Bonaparte.”10 However, it impressed Clausewitz, who, it seems, decided once and for all the defense was the stronger form of war, although his inclination on this matter had been greatly supported during the 1812 campaign in Russia.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>The Waterloo Campaign in 1815 reflected the same trends noted in the previous section—the Napoleonic cycle and operational art in reverse. Although Napoleon put together something of a new Grande Armée, L ‘Armée du Nord (Army of the North), it was missing much of the original’s “equipment.” Marshals Lannes, Bessieres, Murat, and, perhaps especially, Berthier, were no longer there. Davout was deemed too valuable to spare and left in Paris as the minister of war. Finally, the troops themselves, many of them veterans from past wars, had little time to coalesce and train together as had the original ticket along the English Channel from 1803 until 1805 when it marched, nearly 180,000 strong, off to glory at Ulm and Austerlitz 10 years before.12 Another indicator of the reverse trend reflected by the 1815 campaign resides in the area of command and control. The Allied force immediately facing Napoleon had no unity of command; there was no overall army group commander. Blücher and Wellington cooperated more along the lines of Eugene of Savoy and Marlborough, operating in concert in a 19th-century version of early 18th-century military esteem. Of these two armies, Blücher’s army seemed the more modern in retrospect, a veritable Prussian Grande Armée composed of four large combined arms corps with 30,000 men apiece. Also, he had the incomparable Gneisenau at his side as chief of staff with Scharnhorst’s acolytes (including Clausewitz) seconding all his corps commanders. Wellington’s army, on the other hand, looked much like the sort of force Marlborough often took to war a hundred years earlier at slaughters like Oudenarde and Malplaquet, a coalition of disparate European contingents built around a corps of British “shock” troops, as Winston Churchill often characterized them in his famous military biography.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 297 (location ~ 4540-4553)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Perhaps the most positive reflection of the operational art to be found in the Waterloo campaign, at least on the French side, involved the fact that Napoleon could bring even the ghost of the Grande Armée with such rapidity against the Allies, themselves still mobilizing, and shatter their strategic equanimity. It is captured best in this passage from the West Point Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars: “This concentration remains one of the great military feats of history—all the more so in that some of these corps completed their organization as they marched.”14 However, Napoleon soon ran afoul of the frictions of war, despite the strategic surprise occasioned by his sudden arrival in mid-June 1815 at Charleroi at the hinge between the Allied armies under the Duke of Wellington and Field Marshal Blücher (see map 36). The Allies duly concentrated their individual armies prior to attempting to join forces, but on June 16 Napoleon and Marshal Ney fought Blücher and Wellington, respectively, at Ligny and Quatre Bras. As at Jena and Austerstadt, one corps wandered between both battles without participating in either, but the result was not so fortuitous. Ligny was another in a long line of almost-great Napoleonic tactical victories. However, the Prussians, though forced to retreat, did not conform to Napoleon’s wish that they pull away from Wellington and maintained pace with that general and his army.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 298 (location ~ 4557-4567)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Only on the day of battle at Waterloo did the campaign shed some of its 18th-century flavor as the Allied army group, sans an overall commander, came together in the afternoon, increasing in size to almost 140,000 effective combatants to Napoleon’s 72,000 troops (these numbers do not include deductions for casualties throughout the day). Initially Napoleon’s 72,000 faced only Wellington’s 68,000—although commentators have noted that Wellington might have had 85,000, which more nearly approximates the correlation of forces for the French versus the Allies at Austerlitz. Nonetheless, Blücher’s message of promise to support Wellington caused that general to take the luxury of protecting his far right flank with 17,000 troops near Hal. However, with the arrival of the Prussians the campaign’s reflection of the later Napoleonic operational art returns, except with the Allies better mimicking the Napoleonic method of concentration of superior force at the decisive point than the French.18 Comparisons with Austerlitz also fall short when these numbers and how they came to be are examined more closely. They remind one more of Napoleon at Friedland, with Napoleon in the role of Bennigsen, fighting a losing engagement as fresh echelons arrived to overwhelm him.19 Napoleon was defeated by a mechanism that looked a lot like his own masterpieces. Blücher’s army served as the masse de manoeuvre sur la derrier (maneuver mass on the rear) against Napoleon’s flank and line of retreat. Also, it was Blücher’s cavalry that executed the pursuit à outrance after the battle, not the French.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 299 (location ~ 4580-4592)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Had Napoleon won the victory it is more than likely it would have been another of his many “pyrrhic” victories, the most recent being Ligny.24 First, given the events of that day, in all likelihood Napoleon could not have pursued the Allies even had they been forced to retreat on divergent line from the Prussians. Wellington would have fallen back on his reserves and Blücher on his, as had happened so many times in both the 1813 and 1814 campaigns. The durable operational army created by the Napoleonic crucible now lay in the Allies’ possession. Additionally, the second echelon of Allied armies was advancing on all fronts and numbered nearly a half million more troops, under the same resolute leaders as before: Schwarzenberg with Radetzky at his side and the ubiquitous Barclay de Tolly.25 It was only a matter of time, not outcome, and thus Waterloo can be seen as a blessing that prevented the further effusion of needless blood. That was how it was regarded at the time, and the collapse of France so quickly afterward confirms that the spirit of 1794 was no longer there to defend La Patrie en danger if it meant endless war.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 301 (location ~ 4603-4612)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The twilight of Napoleonic operational art settled on Europe as military professionals tried to make sense of what happened.26 Operational art could go only so far once the tyranny of distance and its effects on logistics and command and control limited what the new peoples’ armies could do. The energies that had overcome the obstacles of 18th-century military practice were no longer inflamed by the mighty exertions that the Revolution, Napoleon, and nationalism demanded. However, as the sun set on Napoleonic glories, the tools for the next generation of operational artists were even then being forged in the diabolical workshops of men: the steam engine, the railroad, rifled artillery and muskets, and the telegraph. These workshops soon became known as factories, because of their mass production, such as Eli Whitney’s famous gun factory. In them would be forged the tools for a new round of the violent development of the operational art that came to destroy the old order again—in 1914.</em></p>
