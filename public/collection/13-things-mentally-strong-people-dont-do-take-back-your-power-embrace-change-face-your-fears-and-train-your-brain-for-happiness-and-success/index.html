<p><em>Psychotherapists are known for helping others build on their strengths, doling out tips on how they should act and what they can do to improve themselves. But when I created my list on mental strength, I decided to stray for a moment from what has become second nature to me. And focusing on what not to do has made all the difference. Good habits are important, but it’s often our bad habits that prevent us from reaching our full potential. You can have all the good habits in the world, but if you keep doing the bad habits alongside the good ones, you’ll struggle to reach your goals. Think of it this way: you’re only as good as your worst habits. Bad habits are like heavy weights that you drag around as you go about your day. They’ll slow you down, tire you out, and frustrate you. Despite your hard work and talent, you’ll struggle to reach your full potential when you’ve got certain thoughts, behaviors, and feelings holding you back. Picture a man who chooses to go to the gym every day. He works out for almost two hours. He keeps a careful record of the exercises he performs so he can track his progress. Over the course of six months, he isn’t noticing much of a change. He feels frustrated that he’s not losing weight and gaining muscle. He tells his friends and family that it just doesn’t make sense why he’s not looking and feeling better. After all, he rarely ever misses a workout. What he leaves out of the equation is the fact that he enjoys a treat on his drive home from the gym every day. After all that exercise, he feels hungry and tells himself, “I’ve worked hard. I deserve a treat!” So each day, he eats one dozen donuts on his drive home. Seems ridiculous, right? But we all are guilty of this kind of behavior. We work hard to do the things that we think will make us better, but we forget to focus on the things that might be sabotaging our efforts.</em></p>

<p><em>Just as there are those among us who are predisposed to develop physical strength more easily than others, mental strength seems to come more naturally to some people. There are several factors at play to determine the ease at which you develop mental strength: •    Genetics—Genes play a role in whether or not you may be more prone to mental health issues, such as mood disorders. •    Personality—Some people have personality traits that help them think more realistically and behave more positively by nature. •    Experiences—Your life experiences influence how you think about yourself, other people, and the world in general. Obviously, you can’t change some of these factors. You can’t erase a bad childhood. You can’t help it if you are genetically predisposed to ADHD. But that doesn’t mean you can’t increase your mental strength. Anyone has the power to increase mental strength by devoting time and energy on the self-improvement exercises throughout this book.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 149-156)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>To understand mental strength, you have to learn how your thoughts, behaviors, and feelings are all intertwined, often working together to create a dangerous downward spiral as in the preceding example. This is why developing mental strength requires a three-pronged approach: 1.    Thoughts—Identifying irrational thoughts and replacing them with more realistic thoughts. 2.    Behaviors—Behaving in a positive manner despite the circumstances. 3.    Emotions—Controlling your emotions so your emotions don’t control you. We hear it all the time: “Think positive.” But optimism alone isn’t enough to help you reach your full potential.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 162-167)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There’s a lot of misinformation and misconception about what it means to be mentally strong. Here are some of the truths about mental strength: •    Being mentally strong isn’t about acting tough. You don’t have to become a robot or appear to have a tough exterior when you’re mentally strong. Instead, it’s about acting according to your values. •    Mental strength doesn’t require you to ignore your emotions. Increasing your mental strength isn’t about suppressing your emotions; instead it’s about developing a keen awareness of them. It’s about interpreting and understanding how your emotions influence your thoughts and behavior. •    You don’t have to treat your body like a machine to be mentally strong. Mental strength isn’t about pushing your body to its physical limits just to prove you can ignore pain. It’s about understanding your thoughts and feelings well enough that you can determine when to behave contrary to them, and when to listen to them. •    Being mentally strong doesn’t mean you have to be completely self-reliant. Mental strength isn’t about proclaiming that you don’t ever need help from anyone or any type of higher power. Admitting you don’t have all the answers, asking for help when you need it, and acknowledging that you can gain strength from a higher power is a sign of a desire to grow stronger. •    Being mentally strong is not about positive thinking. Thinking overly positive thoughts can be just as detrimental as thinking overly negative thoughts. Mental strength is about thinking realistically and rationally. •    Developing mental strength isn’t about chasing happiness. Being mentally strong will help you to be more content in life, but it isn’t about waking up every day and trying to force yourself to feel happy. Instead, it’s about making the decisions that will help you reach your full potential. •    Mental strength isn’t just the latest pop psychology trend. Just like the physical fitness world is filled with fad diets and fitness trends, the world of psychology is often filled with fleeting ideas about how to become your best self. Mental strength isn’t a trend. The psychology field has been helping people learn how to change their thoughts, feelings, and behavior since the 1960s. •    Mental strength isn’t synonymous with mental health. While the healthcare industry often talks in terms of mental health versus mental illness, mental strength is different. Just like people can still be physically strong even if they have a physical health ailment like diabetes, you can still be mentally strong even if you have depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems. Having a mental illness doesn’t mean you’re destined to have bad habits. Instead, you can still choose to develop healthy habits. It may require more work, more focus, and more effort, but it’s very possible.</em></p>

<p><em>Self-pity is easily the most destructive of the non-pharmaceutical narcotics; it is addictive, gives momentary pleasure and separates the victim from reality. —JOHN GARDNER</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Feeling sorry for yourself can buy time. Instead of taking action or moving forward, exaggerating how bad your situation is justifies why you shouldn’t do anything to improve it. People often use self-pity as a way to gain attention. Playing the “poor me” card may result in some kind and gentle words from others—at least initially. For people who fear rejection, self-pity can be an indirect way of gaining help by sharing a woe-is-me tale in hopes it will attract some assistance. Unfortunately, misery loves company, and sometimes self-pity becomes a bragging right. A conversation can turn into a contest, with the person who has experienced the most trauma earning the badge of victory. Self-pity can also provide a reason to avoid responsibility. Telling your boss how bad your life is may stem from hopes that less will be expected from you. Sometimes self-pity becomes an act of defiance. It’s almost as if we assume that something will change if we dig in our heels and remind the universe that we deserve better. But that’s not how the world works. There isn’t a higher being—or a human being for that matter—who will swoop in and make sure we’re all dealt a fair hand in life.</em></p>

<p><em>BEHAVE IN A MANNER THAT MAKES IT HARD TO FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF Four months after Lincoln died, his family and I were facing what should have been his twenty-seventh birthday. I had been dreading that day for weeks because I had no idea how we’d pass the time. My cartoon bubble pictured us sitting around in a circle sharing a box of Kleenex and talking about how unfair it was that he never reached his twenty-seventh birthday. When I finally worked up the courage to ask my mother-in-law how she planned to spend the day, without missing a beat she said, “What do you think about skydiving?” The best part was, she was serious. And, I had to admit, jumping out of a perfectly good airplane did seem like a much better idea than the pity party I’d imagined. It felt like the perfect way to honor Lincoln’s adventurous spirit. He’d always enjoyed meeting new people, going new places, and experiencing new things. It wasn’t unusual for him to head off on a spontaneous weekend trip, even if it meant he’d be flying the red-eye home and would have to go to work as soon as he stepped off the overnight flight. He’d say that one day of feeling tired at work was well worth the memories we’d created.

<p><em>Asking yourself the following questions can help change your negative thoughts into more realistic thoughts: •    What’s another way I could view my situation? This is where the “glass half empty or glass half full” thinking comes in. If you’re looking at it from the glass-half-empty angle, take a moment to think about how someone looking from a glass-half-full perspective might view the same situation. •    What advice would I give to a loved one who had this problem? Often, we’re better at handing out words of encouragement to other people rather than to ourselves. It’s unlikely you’d say to someone else, “You’ve got the worst life ever. Nothing ever goes right.” Instead, you’d hopefully offer some kind words of assistance such as, “You’ll figure out what to do, and you’ll make it through this. I know you will.” Take your own words of wisdom and apply them to your situation. •    What evidence do I have that I can get through this? Feeling sorry for ourselves often stems from a lack of confidence in our ability to handle problems. We tend to think that we’ll never get through something. Remind yourself of times when you’ve solved problems and coped with tragedy in the past. Reviewing your skills, support systems, and past experiences can give you an extra boost of confidence that will help you stop feeling sorry for yourself.</em></p>

<p><em>You can choose to catch your negative thoughts before they spiral out of control. Though replacing overly negative thoughts with more realistic ones takes practice and hard work, it’s very effective in decreasing feelings of self-pity. If you think, Bad things always happen to me, create a list of good things that have happened to you as well. Then, replace your original thought with something more realistic like, Some bad things happen to me, but plenty of good things happen to me as well. This doesn’t mean you should turn something negative into an unrealistically positive affirmation. Instead, strive to find a realistic way to look at your situation.</em></p>

<p><em>Initially, Marla became an accomplished athlete in the Paralympics. She competed in 1992 and then again in 1996. Not only did she earn a total of five gold medals and one silver medal, she also set several world records. But Marla didn’t stop there. In 1999, she entered the Pan American Games and she won the 1,500-meter race. In 2000, she became the first legally blind athlete to ever compete in the Olympics. She was the first American to cross the finish line in the 1,500-meter race and she placed eighth overall. Marla doesn’t see her blindness as a disability. In fact, she chooses to view it as a gift that allows her to become successful in both long- and short-distance races. In discussing her blindness in her book, No Finish Line: My Life as I See It, Marla writes, “It not only has forced me to prove my competence but also pushed me to achieve. It has given me gifts, such as will and commitment that I use every day.” Marla doesn’t focus on what her vision loss took from her. Instead, she chooses to feel grateful for what her vision impairment actually gave her. While feeling sorry for yourself is about thinking I deserve better, gratitude is about thinking I have more than I deserve. Experiencing gratitude requires some extra effort, but it isn’t hard. Anyone can learn to become more grateful by developing new habits. Start to acknowledge other people’s kindness and generosity. Affirm the good in the world and you will begin to appreciate what you have.</em></p>

<p><em>Researchers studied the differences that occur when people focus on their burdens versus focusing on what they’re grateful for. Simply acknowledging a few things you feel grateful for each day is a powerful way to create change. In fact, gratitude not only impacts your psychological health, it can also affect your physical health. A 2003 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found: •    People who feel gratitude don’t get sick as often as others. They have better immune systems and report fewer aches and pains. They have lower blood pressure and they exercise more often than the general population. They take better care of their health, sleep longer, and even report feeling more refreshed upon waking. •    Gratitude leads to more positive emotions. People who feel grateful experience more happiness, joy, and pleasure on a daily basis. They even feel more awake and energetic. •    Gratitude improves social lives. Grateful people are more willing to forgive others. They behave in a more outgoing fashion and feel less lonely and isolated. They are also more likely to help other people and to behave in a generous and compassionate manner.</em></p>

<p><em>When we hate our enemies, we are giving them power over us: power over our sleep, our appetites, our blood pressure, our health, and our happiness. —DALE CARNEGIE</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>Anytime you don’t set healthy emotional and physical boundaries for yourself, you risk giving away your power to other people. Perhaps you don’t dare say no when your neighbor asks for a favor. Or maybe you dread receiving a phone call from a friend who constantly complains, but you continue to pick up on the first ring. Each time you avoid saying no to something you really don’t want, you give away your power. If you don’t make any attempt to get your needs met, you’ll give people permission to take things away from you. A lack of emotional boundaries can be equally problematic. If you don’t like the way someone treats you, yet you don’t stand up for yourself, you give that person power over your life.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 512-517)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There are many problems with giving away your power: •    You depend on others to regulate your feelings. When you give away your power, you become completely dependent upon other people and external circumstances to regulate your emotions. Life often becomes like a roller coaster—when things are going well, you’ll feel good; but when your circumstances change, your thoughts, feelings, and behavior will shift. •    You let other people define your self-worth. If you give others the power to determine your self-worth, you’ll never feel worthy enough. You’ll only be as good as someone else’s opinion of you and you will never be able to receive enough praise or positive feedback to meet your needs if you depend on others to feel good about yourself. •    You avoid addressing the real problem. Giving away your power lends itself to helplessness. Rather than focus on what you can do to improve the situation, you’ll find an excuse to justify your problems. •    You become a victim of your circumstances. You’ll become a passenger in your own life rather than a driver. You’ll say other people make you feel bad or force you to behave in a manner you don’t like. You’ll blame others instead of accepting responsibility for your choices. •    You become highly sensitive to criticism. You’ll lack the ability to evaluate criticism. Instead, you’ll take anything anyone says to heart. You’ll give much more power to other people’s words than those words deserve. •    You lose sight of your goals. You won’t be able to build the kind of life you want when you allow other people to be in control of your goals. You can’t work toward your goals successfully when you give other people the power to get in your way and interfere with your progress. •    You ruin relationships. If you don’t speak up when people hurt your feelings or you allow them to infringe on your life in an unwelcomed manner, you’ll likely grow resentful toward them.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 524-539)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Examples of language that indicates you’re giving away your power include: •    “My boss makes me so mad.” You may not like your boss’s behavior, but does he really make you feel angry? Perhaps your boss behaves in a manner that you don’t like and it may influence how you feel, but he’s not forcing you to feel anything. •    “My boyfriend left me because I’m not good enough.” Are you really not good enough or is that just one person’s opinion? If you took a poll of a hundred people, it’s not likely that they’d all come to that same consensus. Just because one person thinks something, it doesn’t make it true. Don’t give one person’s opinion of you the power to determine who you are. •    “My mom makes me feel really bad about myself because she’s always so critical of me.” As an adult, are you obligated to listen to your mother make critical statements about you over and over? Just because she makes comments you don’t like, does it really have to lower your self-esteem? •    “I have to invite my in-laws over for dinner every Sunday night.” Do your in-laws really force you to do that or is that a choice you make because it’s important to your family?</em></p>

<p><em>Here are some strategies to help you stay calm when you’re tempted to react negatively: •    Take deep breaths. Frustration and anger cause physical reactions within the body—an increased rate of breathing, an elevated heart rate, and sweating to name a few. Taking slow, deep breaths can relax your muscles and decrease the physiological response, which in turn can decrease your emotional reactivity. •    Excuse yourself from the situation. The more emotional you feel, the less rational you’ll think. Learn to recognize your personal warning signs of anger—such as shaking or feeling flushed—and remove yourself from the situation before you lose your cool. This may mean saying, “I am not willing to talk about that right now,” or it may mean walking away. •    Distract yourself. Don’t try solving a problem or addressing an issue with someone when you’re feeling overly emotional. Instead, distract yourself with an activity, like walking or reading, to help you calm down. Getting your mind off what’s bothering you, even for a few minutes, can help you calm down so you can think more rationally.</em></p>

<p><em>Not long before she released an album that sold over ten million copies, Madonna received a rejection letter from the president of Millennium Records that said, “The only thing missing from this project is the material.” Had Madonna allowed that letter to define her singing and songwriting abilities, she might have given up. But fortunately, she kept looking for opportunities in the music industry. Soon after that rejection letter, she landed a record deal that launched her career. Within a couple of decades, Madonna was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling female recording artist of all time. She holds numerous other records, including the top-touring female artist of all time, and she’s ranked second on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists—second only to the Beatles. Almost every successful person likely has a similar story of rejection. In 1956, Andy Warhol tried to give one of his paintings to the Museum of Modern Art, but they declined to accept it even for free. Fast-forward to 1989, and his paintings had become so successful that he earned his own museum. The Andy Warhol Museum is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist.

<p><em>Not long before she released an album that sold over ten million copies, Madonna received a rejection letter from the president of Millennium Records that said, “The only thing missing from this project is the material.” Had Madonna allowed that letter to define her singing and songwriting abilities, she might have given up. But fortunately, she kept looking for opportunities in the music industry. Soon after that rejection letter, she landed a record deal that launched her career. Within a couple of decades, Madonna was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the bestselling female recording artist of all time. She holds numerous other records, including the top-touring female artist of all time, and she’s ranked second on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists—second only to the Beatles. Almost every successful person likely has a similar story of rejection. In 1956, Andy Warhol tried to give one of his paintings to the Museum of Modern Art, but they declined to accept it even for free. Fast-forward to 1989, and his paintings had become so successful that he earned his own museum. The Andy Warhol Museum is the largest museum in the United States dedicated to a single artist. Clearly, everyone has an opinion, but successful people don’t allow one person’s opinion to define them.</em></p>

<p><em>When you receive criticism or feedback from others, wait a beat before responding. If you’re upset or emotionally reactive, take the time to calm down. Then ask yourself these questions: •    What evidence is there that this is true? For example, if your boss says you are lazy, look for evidence of times when you haven’t worked very hard. •    What evidence do I have this isn’t true? Look for times when you have put in a lot of effort and have been a hard worker. •    Why might this person be giving me this feedback? Take a step back and see if you can find out why this person may be giving you negative feedback. Is it based on the small sampling of your behavior that the person has witnessed? For example, if your boss only watched you work on a day where you were coming down with the flu, she may decide that you aren’t very productive. Her conclusion may not be accurate. •    Do I want to change any of my behavior? There may be times where you choose to change your behavior because you agree with the other person’s criticism. For example, if your boss says you’re lazy, maybe you’ll decide that you haven’t been putting in as much effort at the office as you could. So you decide to start showing up early and staying late because it’s important to you to be a good worker. Just remember, though, that your boss isn’t forcing you to do anything different. You are choosing to create change because you want to, not because you have to. Keep in mind that one person’s opinion of you doesn’t make it true. You can respectfully choose to disagree and move on without devoting time and energy into trying to change the other person’s mind.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are some other ways how retaining your power will help you become mentally strong: •    You’ll develop a better sense of who you are when you’re able to make choices based on what’s best for you instead of what will prevent the most repercussions. •    When you take responsibility for your own behavior, you’ll become accountable for your progress toward your goals. •    You will never be pressured into doing something that you don’t want to do based on guilt trips or what you think other people want you to do. •    You’ll be able to devote your time and energy to things you choose. You won’t have to blame other people for wasting your time or ruining your day. •    Retaining your personal power reduces your risk of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Many mental health problems are linked to a sense of hopelessness and helplessness.

<p><em>Research shows some of the health benefits of forgiveness include the following: •    Forgiveness reduces your stress. Over the years, many studies have shown that holding a grudge keeps your body in a state of stress. When you practice forgiveness, your blood pressure and heart rate decrease. •    Choosing to forgive increases your tolerance to pain. In a 2005 study of patients with chronic low back pain, anger increased psychological distress and decreased a person’s tolerance to pain. A willingness to forgive was associated with increased pain tolerance. •    Unconditional forgiveness can help you to live longer. A 2012 study published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine discovered that when people were only willing to forgive others under certain conditions—like the other person apologized or promised to never repeat the same behavior—their risk of dying early actually increased. You don’t have any control over whether someone will apologize. Waiting to forgive people until they say they’re sorry gives them control over not just your life, but perhaps even your death.</em></p>

<p><em>TYPES OF CHANGE We can experience different types of change, some you might find easier than others: •    All-or-nothing change—Some changes are incremental while others are basically all or nothing. Deciding to have a child, for example, isn’t something you can do in steps. Once you have that baby, your life has irrevocably changed. •    Habit change—You can choose to either get rid of bad habits, like sleeping too late, or you can choose to create good habits, like exercising five times a week. Most habit changes allow you to try something new for a little while, but you can always revert back to your old habits. •    Trying-something-new change—Change sometimes involves trying something new or mixing up your daily routine, like volunteering at a hospital or taking violin lessons. •    Behavioral change—Sometimes there are behavioral changes that don’t necessarily constitute a habit. For example, maybe you want to commit to going to all of your child’s sports games or maybe you want to behave friendlier. •    Emotional change—Not all change is tangible. Sometimes it’s emotional. For example, if you want to feel less irritable all the time, you’ll need to examine the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to your irritability. •    Cognitive change—There may be ways in which you want to change your thinking as well. Perhaps you want to think less about the past or maybe decrease worrisome thoughts.</em></p>

<p><em>THE FIVE STAGES OF CHANGE 1.    Precontemplation—When people are precontemplative, they don’t yet identify any need to change. Richard was precontemplative about making any changes to his health for years. He avoided going to the doctor, he refused to step on a scale, and he dismissed any comments his wife made when she expressed concern about his health. 2.    Contemplation—People who are actively contemplative are considering the pros and cons of making a change. When I first saw Richard, he was contemplative. He was aware that not changing his eating habits could have serious consequences, but he was also not yet certain how to go about creating change. 3.    Preparation—This is the stage where people prepare to make a change. They establish a plan with concrete steps that identify what they are going to do differently. Once Richard moved into the preparation stage, he scheduled days to work out and chose one snack to swap for something healthier. 4.    Action—This is where the concrete behavioral change takes place. Richard started going to the gym and swapped his afternoon cookies for carrots. 5.    Maintenance—This often overlooked step is essential. Richard needed to plan ahead so he could maintain his lifestyle changes when he faced obstacles, like holidays or vacations.</em></p>

<p><em>•    Staying the same often equals getting stuck in a rut. Life can get pretty boring if you don’t do anything differently. A person who simply decides to keep things as mundane and low-key as possible isn’t likely to experience a rich, full life and might become depressed. •    You won’t learn new things. The world will change with or without you. Don’t think that your choice not to change will prevent anyone else from embracing change. You’ll risk being left in the dust if you choose to keep doing everything the same for the rest of your life. •    Your life may not get better. If you don’t change, you can’t make your life better. Many problems that are waiting to be solved require you to do something different. But if you aren’t willing to try something new, those issues are likely to remain unresolved. •    You won’t challenge yourself to develop healthier habits. It’s easy to develop bad habits. Breaking bad habits requires a willingness to try something new. •    Other people will outgrow you. “My husband isn’t the same man I married thirty years ago.” I hear this all the time in my office, and my response is usually, “Let’s hope not.” I hope everyone grows and changes over the course of thirty years. If you are unwilling to challenge yourself and improve, others may grow bored with you. •    The longer you wait the harder it gets. Do you think it’s easier to quit smoking after your first cigarette or after twenty years of smoking? The longer you keep the same habits, the harder they can be to break. Sometimes people put off change until the right time. They say things like “I’ll look for a new job when things calm down” or “I’ll worry about losing weight after the holidays.” But, often, the perfect time to do something never arises.

<p><em>IDENTIFY THE PROS AND CONS OF CHANGING Create a list of what is good about staying the same and what is bad about staying the same. Then, create a list about the potentially good and bad outcomes of making a change. Don’t simply make your decision based on the sheer number of pros versus cons. Instead, examine the list. Read it over a few times and think about the potential consequences of changing versus staying the same. If you’re still considering change, this exercise can help you move closer to making a decision. There’s no need to change for the sake of change. Moving to a new home, starting a new relationship, or switching jobs aren’t inherently going to increase your mental strength. Instead, it’s important to pay close attention to the reasons why you want to change so you can determine whether the decision is about doing what’s ultimately best for you. If you’re still ambivalent, create a behavioral experiment. Unless you’re dealing with an all-or-nothing change, try something new for one week. After you’ve done it for a week, evaluate your progress and motivation. Decide if you want to continue with the change or not.</em></p>

<p><em>Don’t allow your emotions to make the final decision. Sometimes you have to be willing to change, even when you don’t “feel like it.” Balance your emotions with rational thinking. If you’re terrified of doing something new, and it really won’t make a big difference in your life, you may decide it’s not worth putting yourself through the stress of change. But, if you can rationally identify how change will be best for you in the long term, it may make sense to tolerate the discomfort.</em></p>

Identify at least one step you can take each day to move closer to your goal. •    Anticipate obstacles along the way. Make a plan for how you will respond to specific challenges that you’re likely to encounter. Planning ahead can help you stay on track. •    Establish accountability. We do best when we establish some type of accountability for our progress. Enlist the help of friends and family who can provide support and check in with you about your progress. Be accountable to yourself by writing down your progress daily. •    Monitor your progress. Determine how you’ll keep track of your progress.

<p><em>Trying to control everything usually starts out as a way to manage anxiety. If you know you have everything under control, what’s there to worry about? Rather than focusing on managing your anxiety, you try controlling your environment. The desire to fix everything can also stem from a sort of superhero complex. We hold on to the mistaken belief that if we just try hard enough, everything will turn out the way we want. Rather than delegating a task to a coworker, or trusting a spouse to run an errand, we often choose to do it ourselves to make sure it will be “done right” because we don’t trust in other people’s capabilities.</em></p>

<p><em>People with an external locus of control believe that their lives depend highly on fate, luck, or destiny. They’re more likely to believe “Whatever’s meant to be will be.” People with an internal locus of control believe they have complete control over their future. They take full responsibility for their successes and failures in life. They believe they have the ability to control everything from their financial future to their health. Your locus of control will determine how you view your circumstances. Imagine a person who attends a job interview. He possesses the qualifications, education, and experience the company is looking for. But a few days after the interview, he receives a call telling him he didn’t get the job. If he has an external locus of control he’ll think, They probably had some overqualified people apply for the position. It wasn’t the right job for me anyway. If he has an internal locus of control, he’s more likely to think, I must not have done a good job impressing them. I knew I should have redone my résumé. I’ve also got to sharpen my interview skills. Several factors influence your locus of control. Your childhood experiences certainly play a role. If you grew up in a family where hard work was valued, you may lean more toward an internal locus of control, because you’ll believe that hard work can pay off. If however, you grew up with parents who drilled into you things such as, “Your vote doesn’t matter in this world,” or “No matter what you do, the world will always keep you down,” you may have developed an external locus of control. Your experiences throughout life can also influence your locus of control. If you achieve success when you try hard, you’ll see that you have a lot of control over the outcome. But if you feel like no matter what you do, things just don’t turn out right, you may begin to feel like you have less control. An internal locus of control has often been idealized as the “best” way to be. Ideas like “You can do anything if you just put your mind to it” have been valued in many cultures. In fact, people with a high sense of control often make great CEOs because they believe in their ability to make a difference. Doctors like having patients with a strong internal locus of control because they do everything possible to treat and prevent illness. But there are also potential downsides to believing you can control everything.</em></p>

<p><em>There are several problems associated with trying to control everything: •    Trying to maintain complete control leads to increased anxiety. Efforts to manage your anxiety by trying to control everything in your environment will backfire. The more unsuccessful your attempts to control the situation are, the more anxious you’ll become. It can lead to feelings of inadequacy as you see that you aren’t able to fully control the outcome. •    Attempting to control everything wastes time and energy. Worrying about things outside of your control wastes mental energy. Wishing circumstances were different, trying to convince people they have to do everything your way, and attempting to prevent anything bad from ever happening is exhausting. It takes energy away from actively problem solving and the issues you do have control over. •    Being a control freak damages relationships. Telling people what they should do or how to do things right isn’t likely to attract many friends. In fact, many who have control issues struggle to get close to people because they don’t trust others with any type of responsibility. •    You’ll judge others harshly. If you credit all your success in life to your abilities, you’ll criticize people who haven’t achieved the same. In fact, people with a high internal locus of control tend to suffer from loneliness because they feel irritable that other people aren’t keeping up with their standards. •    You’ll unnecessarily blame yourself for everything. You can’t prevent bad things from happening all the time. But, if you think everything is within your control, you’ll believe you’re directly responsible every time life doesn’t go according to your plan.</em></p>

<p><em>Those who strike the right balance of control recognize how their behaviors can affect their chances of success, but they also identify how external factors, such as being in the right place at the right time, can play a role. Researchers found that these people have a bi-locus of control, as opposed to a complete internal or external locus of control. To achieve this balance in your own life, be willing to examine your beliefs about what you truly can control and what you can’t. Take notice of times when you’ve devoted too much energy to people and circumstances that you just couldn’t change. Remind yourself that there’s a lot you can’t control: •    You can host a good party, but you can’t control whether people have fun. •    You can give your child tools to be successful, but you can’t make your child be a good student. •    You can do your best at your job, but you can’t force your boss to recognize your work. •    You can sell a great product, but you can’t dictate who buys it. •    You may be the smartest person in the room, but you can’t control whether people choose to follow your advice. •    You can nag, beg, and make threats, but you can’t force your spouse to behave differently. •    You can have the most positive attitude in the world, but it can’t make a terminal diagnosis disappear. •    You can control how much you take care of yourself, but you can’t always prevent illness. •    You can control what you’re doing, but you can’t control your competitor.</em></p>

If you have your most important belongings and an extra change of clothing with you, it won’t feel like such an emergency if your luggage doesn’t arrive at your destination on time. By focusing on what you can control, it is much easier to let go of worrying about what you can’t. When you notice you have a lot of anxiety about a situation, do what you can to manage your reaction and influence the outcome.

<p><em>Here are strategies to influence others without trying to force them to change: •    Listen first, speak second. Other people are often less defensive when they feel like you’ve taken the time to hear what they have to say. •    Share your opinion and concerns, but only share it once. Repeating your unease over and over again won’t make your words any more effective. In fact, it can backfire. •    Change your behavior. If a wife doesn’t want her husband to drink, emptying his beer cans down the drain isn’t going to motivate him to stop drinking. But she can choose to spend time with him when he’s sober and not be around him when he’s drinking. If he enjoys spending time with her, he may choose to remain sober more often. •    Point out the positive. If someone is making a genuine effort to create change, whether it’s to stop smoking or start exercising, offer some genuine praise. Just don’t go overboard or say something like, “See, I told you that you’d feel better if you quit eating all that junk food.” Backhanded compliments or an “I told you so” don’t motivate people to change.</em></p>

<p><em>When you stop trying to control every aspect of your life, you’ll have more time and energy to devote to things you can control. Here are some of the benefits you’ll experience: •    Increased happiness—The maximum level of happiness is achieved when people have a balanced locus of control. Coined as a “bi-local expectancy,” the people who understand that they can take a lot of steps to control their lives while also recognizing the limitations of their ability are happier than people who think they can control everything. •    Better relationships—When you give up your need for control, you’ll likely experience better relationships. You’ll have fewer trust issues and you’ll welcome more people into your life. You may be more willing to ask for help, and other people are likely to view you as less critical. Research indicates that people who stop trying to control everything experience an increased sense of belonging and community. •    Less stress—When you stop carrying around the weight of the world, you’ll feel less stressed. You may experience more short-term anxiety as you give up control, but over the long term, you’ll have a lot less stress and anxiety. •    New opportunities—When you have a strong need to control things, you’ll be less likely to invite change into your life because there aren’t any guarantees of a positive outcome. When you choose to give up your need to control everything, you’ll have increased confidence in your ability to handle new opportunities. •    More success—Although most people who want to control everything have a deep desire to be successful, having an internal locus of control can actually interfere with your chances of success. Research shows that it’s possible to become so focused on ensuring you’ll be successful, you could actually overlook opportunities that could help you advance. When you give up your desire to control everything, you’ll be more willing to look around and you may recognize good fortune that comes your way even if it isn’t directly related to your behavior.</em></p>

<p><em>Megan said to me that her number one rule was to never say no to family. So each time her cousin asked for a favor or her sister asked her to babysit, she automatically said yes. When I asked her what impact that had on her husband and children, she told me that sometimes it meant she wasn’t home in time for dinner or to put the kids to bed. Just admitting that out loud helped Megan begin to realize why saying yes to extended family meant she was saying no to her immediate family. Although she valued her extended family, her husband and her children were her top priorities, and she decided she needed to start treating them accordingly. We also reviewed her desire to be liked by everyone. Her biggest fear was that other people would think she was selfish. However, after a few therapy sessions she began to recognize that her need to always be liked was actually much more selfish than saying no to someone. Helping others really wasn’t about improving their lives; she was mostly giving of herself because she wanted to be held in higher regard. Once she changed the way she thought about people pleasing, she was able to begin changing her behavior.</em></p>

Unfortunately, this leaves the people you love the most feeling hurt or angry. Shouldn’t we do the opposite? Shouldn’t we work the hardest on the most intimate and special relationships? Ever met someone who behaves like a martyr? Such individuals’ attempts to please others actually becomes a turnoff.

Instead of dressing, acting, and speaking in a manner that was pleasing to others, they’d wished they’d been true to themselves. There’s even research published in the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology that shows people pleasers in a study tended to eat more when they thought it would make others around them happier.

In fact, Craigslist turned down a variety of revenue-generating opportunities. Instead, Buckmaster and the team decided to keep the website simple, and only charge users for a very few specific types of listings. The bulk of user-generated listings has remained a free service. In fact, the company doesn’t even have a marketing team. Craigslist received a lot of backlash for this decision and Buckmaster has been the target of much criticism. He’s been accused of being anticapitalistic and even called a “social anarchist.” But Buckmaster didn’t try to please his critics. Instead, he continued running Craigslist the way it has always operated. His willingness to go against the grain and prevent Craigslist from depending too heavily on advertisements has likely kept the business running. It survived the dot-com crash with ease and continues to be one of the most popular websites in the world. Craigslist has been estimated to be worth at least $5 billion.

<p><em>When you second-guess whether you should express your opinion, remember these truths about people pleasing: •    Worrying about trying to please everyone is a waste of time. You can’t control how other people feel and the more time you spend devoting your thoughts to wondering if people will be happy, the less time you’ll have to think about what really matters. •    People pleasers are easily manipulated. Others can recognize a people pleaser a mile away. Manipulators often use tactics to prey on people pleasers’ emotions and control their behavior. Be on the lookout for people who say things like “I’m only asking you to do to this because you’d do the best job” or “I hate to ask you this, but . . .” •    It’s okay for other people to feel angry or disappointed. There is no reason that people need to feel happy or pleased all the time. Everyone has the ability to cope with a wide array of feelings, and it’s not your job to prevent them from feeling negative emotions. Just because someone gets mad, it doesn’t necessarily mean you did anything wrong. •    You can’t please everyone. It’s impossible for everyone to be delighted by the same things. Accept that some people will just never be pleased, and it isn’t your job to make them happy.</em></p>

Common values include: •    Children •    Romantic relationship •    Extended family •    Religious/Spiritual beliefs •    Volunteering or helping other people •    Career •    Money •    Maintaining good friendships •    Taking care of your physical health •    Having a sense of purpose •    Leisure activities •    Pleasing people •    Education Pick your top five values in life and rank them in order from most important to least important. Now stop and think about whether you are actually living according to those values. How much of your time, money, energy, and skill is devoted to each one? Are you putting too much effort into something that’s not even on your list? Where on your list does pleasing people fall? It should never be at the top. Reviewing the order of your list from time to time can help you determine if your life is out of balance.</em></p>

<p><em>If automatically saying yes has become a habit in your life, learn how to evaluate your decision before giving an answer. When someone asks you to do something, ask yourself these questions before responding: •    Is this something I want to do? Most people pleasers don’t even know what they want because they’re so used to doing things automatically. Take a moment to evaluate your opinion. •    What will I have to give up by doing this? If you do something for someone else, you’ll have to give something up. Maybe it’s time with your family or perhaps it will cost you money. Before making a decision, recognize what saying yes will mean for you. •    What will I gain by doing this? Maybe it will give you an opportunity to improve your relationship, or maybe doing something like this will likely be something you enjoy. Think about the potential benefits of saying yes. •    How will I feel if I do it? Are you likely to feel angry and resentful? Or will you feel happy and proud? Take some time to imagine how you’re likely to feel as you weigh your options. Like Megan discovered, you don’t need to have an excuse about why you can’t do something. When you say no, you can say something such as “I wish I could but I’m not going to be able to do that” or “Sorry, but I won’t be able to.” If you’re not used to saying no, it can take some practice, but it gets easier with time.</em></p>

To permanently leave, he’d never again be allowed contact with anyone in the Amish community, including his mother and his siblings. Besides, stepping into the “English world” would be like entering a foreign land. Mose had never been allowed to use modern-day conveniences, like computers, or even electricity. How could he possibly make it on his own in the outside world that he didn’t know much about? Entering a relatively unknown world wasn’t the scariest part for Mose. Instead, he was most terrified that he’d go to hell. He’d always been warned that the Amish God was the only God, and to leave the Amish meant he’d be leaving God. The Amish elders told him that there was no hope for people in the outside world. Individuals who left the Amish, but tried to remain Christians, were only playing with fire.</em></p>

<p><em>Your words and your behavior must be in line with your beliefs before you can begin to enjoy a truly authentic life. When you stop worrying about pleasing everyone and, instead, are willing to be bold enough to live according to your own values, you’ll experience many benefits: •    Your self-confidence will soar. The more you’re able to see that you don’t have to make people happy, the more independence and confidence you’ll gain. You’ll feel content with the decisions you make, even when other people disagree with your actions, because you’ll know you made the right choice. •    You’ll have more time and energy to devote to your goals. Instead of wasting energy trying to become the person you think others want you to be, you’ll have time and energy to work on yourself. When you channel that effort toward your goals, you’ll be much more likely to be successful. •    You’ll feel less stressed. When you set limits and healthy boundaries, you’ll experience a lot less stress and irritation. You’ll feel like you have more control over your life. •    You’ll establish healthier relationships. Other people will develop more respect for you when you behave in an assertive manner. Your communication will improve and you’ll be able to prevent yourself from building a lot of anger and resentment toward people. •    You’ll have increased willpower. An interesting 2008 study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology showed that people have much more willpower when they’re making choices on their own accord rather than out of an attempt to please someone else. If you’re only doing something to make someone else happy, you’ll struggle to reach your goal. You’ll be motivated to keep up the good work if you’re convinced it’s the best choice for you.</em></p>

<p><em>Do you respond positively to any of the points below?     You struggle to make important decisions in your life.     You spend a lot of time daydreaming about what you’d like to do, but you don’t take any action.     Sometimes you impulsively make a decision because thinking about the decision is just too anxiety provoking.     You often think you could be doing a lot more adventurous and exciting things in life, but your fear holds you back.     When you think about taking a risk, you usually only imagine the worst-case scenario and choose not to take the chance.     You sometimes allow other people to make decisions for you so you don’t have to make them.     You avoid risks in at least some areas of your life—social, financial, or physical—because you’re afraid.     You base decisions on your level of fear. If you’re a little afraid, you might do something. But, if you feel really afraid, you decide taking the risk is unwise.     You think that outcomes are largely dependent on luck. A lack of knowledge about how to calculate risk leads to increased fear. And fearing risk often leads to avoidance. But there are steps you can take to increase your ability to calculate risk accurately, and with practice, your risk-taking skills can improve.</em></p>

<p><em>Risk starts out as a thought process. Whether you’re considering purchasing a new home, or you’re deciding whether to put on your seat belt, the decision involves some level of risk. Your thoughts about the risk will influence the way you feel, and ultimately, sway your behavior. When you’re driving your car, you decide how fast to go. You face safety and legal risks while driving on the road, and you must balance these risks with your time. The faster you drive, the less time you have to spend in the car, but driving faster will also increase your risk of getting in an accident and receiving legal consequences. It’s unlikely you spend much time thinking about how fast to drive on your way to work each day. Instead your decision to obey the law or break the speed limit weighs heavily on your usual routine. But if you’re running late one day, you’ll need to decide whether to drive faster and risk more physical and legal danger or risk being late for work. The truth is, most of us don’t really invest much time calculating which risks to take and which risks to avoid. Instead, we base our decisions on emotions or habit. If it sounds too scary, we avoid the risk. If we’re excited about the possible benefits, we’re more likely to overlook the risk.</em></p>

<p><em>YOU DON’T GET TO BE EXTRAORDINARY WITHOUT TAKING CALCULATED RISKS Othmar Ammann was a Swiss-born engineer who immigrated to the United States. He started out as the chief engineer to the Port Authority of New York and within seven years, they promoted him to director of engineering. By all accounts, he had an important job. But for as long as he could remember, Ammann had dreamed of becoming an architect. So he left his coveted job and set out to open his own business. In the years that followed, Ammann contributed to some of the most impressive American bridges, including the Verrazano-Narrows, the Delaware Memorial, and the Walt Whitman. His ability to design and create ornate, complicated, and extravagant structures earned him multiple awards. Most impressive of all might be that Ammann was sixty years old when he switched careers. He continued to create architectural masterpieces right up until he was eighty-six. At an age when most people don’t want to take any more risks, Ammann chose to take a calculated risk that allowed him to live his dream. If we only take risks that make us the most comfortable, we’re likely missing out on some great opportunities. Taking calculated risks often mean the difference between living a mediocre life and living an extraordinary life.</em></p>

<p><em>our “fear meters” aren’t always reliable. They sometimes go off even when we’re not in any actual danger. And when we feel afraid, we tend to behave accordingly, falsely believing “If it feels scary, it must be too risky.” For years, we’ve been warned against the dangers of anything from killer bees to mad cow disease. It seems like we’re constantly hearing various statistics, research studies, and warnings about so many perils that it becomes difficult to decipher the extent of danger we actually face in our lives. Take the research about cancer, for example. Some studies estimate cancer accounts for nearly one of every four deaths and other reports warn that within a few years about half of us will have cancer. Although those types of statistics can be a cause for alarm, they can often be misleading. A closer look at the numbers reveals a young healthy person who maintains a healthy lifestyle has a relatively low risk of developing cancer compared to an older, overweight person who smokes. But sometimes it’s hard to put our personal level of risk into perspective when we’re constantly bombarded with such frightening statistics.</em></p>

<p><em>Manufacturers of cleaning solutions have worked hard to convince us we need powerful chemicals, hand sanitizers, and antibacterial soaps to protect ourselves from germs. Media stories warn us that our kitchen countertops have more germs than our toilet seats as we’re given visual reminders of how fast bacteria grows in a petri dish. Germaphobic people heed these warnings by taking drastic precautions to combat the risk of coming into contact with germs. They sanitize their homes daily with caustic chemicals, scrub their hands repeatedly with antibacterial products, and replace handshakes with fist bumps to reduce the spread of germs. But attempts to win the war on germs may actually do more harm than good. In fact, there’s research that shows getting rid of too many germs reduces our ability to build immunity from illness. A study from Johns Hopkins Children’s Center found that newborns who were exposed to germs, pet and rodent dander, and roach allergens were less likely to develop asthma and allergies. Fear leads many people to incorrectly assume that germs pose a much higher risk than they actually do, because in the reality, bacteria-free environments may pose a greater threat to our health than the germs. It’s important to be aware of your emotions throughout the decision-making process. If you’re feeling sad, you’re likely to anticipate failure and avoid the risk. If you’re feeling happy, you may disregard the risk and forge ahead. There’s even research that shows that fear of something completely unrelated to the risk can influence your decision. If you’re stressed about your job, and you’re also considering purchasing a new home, you’ll be more likely to view that home purchase as a bigger risk than if you weren’t feeling stressed at work. Often, we’re not good at separating what factors are influencing our feelings so we lump them all together.</em></p>

<p><em>Many people are terrified to fly in airplanes. Often, this fear stems from a lack of control. The pilot is in control, not the passengers, and this lack of control instills fear. Many potential passengers are so afraid they choose to drive great distances to get to a destination instead of flying. But their decision to drive is based solely on emotion, not logic. Logic says that statistically, the odds of dying in a car crash are around 1 in 5,000, while the odds of dying in a plane crash are closer to 1 in 11 million. If you’re going to take a risk, especially one that could possibly involve your well-being, wouldn’t you want the odds in your favor? However, most people choose the option that will cause them the least amount of anxiety. Pay attention to the thoughts you have about taking the risk and make sure you’re basing your decision on facts, not just feelings.

<p><em>Frighteningly, many of our major life decisions are based on complete irrationality: •    We incorrectly judge how much control we have over a situation. We’re usually more willing to take bigger risks when we think we have more control. Most people feel more comfortable when they’re in the driver’s seat of a car for example, but just because you’re in the driver’s seat doesn’t mean you can avoid an accident. •    We overcompensate when safeguards are in place. We behave more recklessly when we think there are safety nets in place, and ultimately, we increase our risk. People tend to speed more when they wear their seat belts. And insurance companies discovered that increased safety features on cars actually correlated with higher accident rates. •    We don’t recognize the difference between skill and chance. Casinos have discovered that when gamblers play craps, they roll the dice differently depending on what type of number they need to win. When they want to roll a high number, they throw the dice hard. When they want a small number, they roll the dice softly. Even though it’s a game of chance, people behave as if it involves some level of skill. •    We are influenced by our superstitious beliefs. Whether a business leader wears his lucky socks or a person reads his horoscope before leaving the house, superstitions impact our willingness to take risks. On average, ten thousand fewer people fly on Friday the thirteenth, and black cats are less likely to get adopted from a shelter on that day. Although research shows most people think crossing their fingers increases their luck, in reality, it does nothing to mitigate risk. •    We become easily deluded when we see a potentially large payoff. Even when the odds are stacked against you, if you really like the potential payoff, like in the lottery for example, you’ll likely overestimate your odds of success. •    We grow comfortable with familiarity. The more often we take a risk, the more we tend to miscalculate how big of a risk we’re actually taking. If you take the same risk over and over again, you’ll stop perceiving it as risky. If you speed on your way to work every day, you’ll greatly underestimate the danger you’re putting yourself in. •    We place a lot of faith in other people’s abilities to perceive risk accurately. Emotions can be contagious. If you’re in a crowd of people who don’t react to the smell of smoke, it’s likely you might not sense much danger. In contrast, if other people begin to panic, you’re much more likely to react. •    We can be influenced by the media in how we perceive risk. If you are constantly exposed to news stories about a rare disease, you’re more likely to think your chances of contracting the disease are higher, even if all the news stories are only reporting on isolated incidents. Similarly, stories about natural disasters or tragic events can cause you to feel you are at a greater risk of catastrophe than you actually are.</em></p>

<p><em>The level of risk you’ll experience in a given situation is unique to you. While speaking in front of a group is a risk to some people, it’s not risky at all to others. Ask yourself the following questions to help you calculate your risk level: •    What are the potential costs? Sometimes the cost of taking a risk is tangible—like the money you might spend on an investment—but other times, intangible costs are associated with risk, like the risk of being rejected. •    What are the potential benefits? Consider the potential positive outcome of taking the risk. Look at what would happen if the risk turns out well. Do you stand to gain increased finances? Better relationships? Improved health? There needs to be a big enough payoff to outweigh the potential costs. •    How will this help me achieve my goal? It is important to examine your bigger goals and look at how this risk plays into that goal. For example, if you are hoping to gain more money, look at how opening your own business could help you with that goal as you examine your risk. •    What are the alternatives? Sometimes we look at risk as if we only have two choices—take the risk or pass it up. But, often, there are many different types of opportunities that can help you reach your goals. It’s important to recognize those alternatives that may lie in between so you can make the most well-informed decision. •    How good would it be if the best-case scenario came true? Spend some time really thinking about the payoff in a risk and how that payoff could impact your life. Try to develop realistic expectations for how the best-case scenario could benefit you. •    What is the worst thing that could happen and how could I reduce the risk it will occur? It’s also important to really examine the worst-possible scenario and then think about steps you could take to minimize the risk that it would happen. For example, if you are considering investing in a business, how could you increase your chance for success? •    How bad would it be if the worst-case scenario did come true? Just like hospitals, cities, and governments have disaster-preparedness plans, it can be helpful to create your own. Develop a plan for how you could respond if the worst-case scenario did occur. •    How much will this decision matter in five years? To help you keep things in perspective, ask yourself how much this particular risk is likely to impact your future. If it’s a small risk, you probably won’t even remember it a few years from now. If it’s a big risk, it could greatly impact your future. It can be helpful to write down your answers so you can review them and read them over. Be willing to do more research and gain as much information as possible when you don’t have the facts available to help you calculate a risk properly. When the information is not available, resolve to make the best decision you can with the information you have.</em></p>

<p><em>As a young man, Ellis was incredibly shy and he feared talking to women. He was terrified of getting rejected, so he avoided ever asking a woman out on a date. But, ultimately, he knew that rejection wasn’t the worst thing in the world and decided to face his fears. He went to a local botanical garden every day for a month. Whenever he saw a woman sitting by herself on a bench, he sat next to her. He forced himself to start up a conversation within one minute of sitting down. In that month, he found 130 opportunities to speak with women and of those 130, 30 women got up and walked away as soon as he sat down. But he started conversations with the rest. Out of the 100 women he invited on a date, one said yes—however, she didn’t show up. But Ellis didn’t despair. Instead, it reinforced to him that he could tolerate taking risks even when he feared rejection. By facing his fears, Ellis recognized his irrational thoughts that had made him more fearful of taking risks. Understanding how these thoughts influenced his feelings helped him later develop new therapy techniques that would help other people challenge their irrational thinking. Like Ellis, monitor the outcome of the risks that you take. Take notice of how you felt before, during, and after taking a risk.

<p><em>Ruminating on the past won’t change it. Instead, wasting your time dwelling on what’s already happened will only lead to more problems in the future. Here are some of the ways that dwelling on the past can interfere with your ability to be your best self: •    You miss out on the present. You can’t enjoy the present if your mind is constantly stuck in the past. You’ll miss out on experiencing new opportunities and celebrating the joys of today if you’re distracted by things that have already occurred. •    Dwelling on the past makes it impossible to adequately prepare for the future. You won’t be able to clearly define your goals or stay motivated to create change when a big part of you remains stuck in the past. •    Dwelling on the past interferes with your decision-making skills. When you have unresolved issues from the past, those conflicts will cloud your thinking. You won’t be able to adequately make healthy decisions about what’s best for you today when you can’t get over something that happened yesterday. •    Dwelling on the past doesn’t solve anything. Replaying the same scripts in your head and focusing on things you no longer have control over won’t resolve anything. •    Dwelling on the past can lead to depression. Ruminating on negative events conjures up negative emotions. And when you feel sad, the more likely you are to conjure up even more sad memories. Dwelling on past times can be a vicious cycle that keeps you stuck in the same emotional state. •    Romanticizing the past—the grass-is-greener philosophy—isn’t helpful. It’s easy to convince yourself that you felt happier, more confident, and completely carefree back then. But there’s a good chance you’re exaggerating how great things used to be. It can also make you exaggerate how bad things are now. •    Dwelling on the past is bad for your physical health. Thinking constantly about negative events increases inflammation in your body, according to a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Ohio. Dwelling on the past could put you at a greater risk for diseases associated with heart disease, cancer, and dementia.</em></p>

<p><em>SHIFT YOUR THINKING Dwelling starts out as a cognitive process, but eventually it influences your emotions and behavior. By shifting the way you think about the past, you can move forward. •    Schedule time to think about a past event. Sometimes our brains need a chance to sort things out and the more you tell yourself not to think about it, the more those memories can crop up throughout the day. Instead of battling to suppress the memories, remind yourself, I can think about that after dinner tonight. Then, after dinner, give yourself twenty minutes to think about it. When your time is up, move on to something else. •    Give yourself something else to think about. Create a plan to help you think about something else. For example, decide that whenever you think about that job you didn’t get, you’ll shift your focus to thinking about planning your next vacation. This can be especially helpful if you’re prone to dwell on the negative right before you go to sleep at night. •    Establish goals for the future. It’s impossible to dwell on the past if you’re planning for the future. Establish both short-term and long-term goals and begin working on the action steps needed to achieve those goals. It will give you something to look forward to while also preventing you from looking too much into the past.</em></p>

<p><em>When you recall negative memories, try these strategies to keep your experiences in perspective: •    Focus on the lessons you learned. If you’ve endured hard times, focus on what you’ve learned from that experience. Accept that it happened and think about how you may be a changed person because of it but realize that doesn’t necessarily have to be a bad thing. Maybe you learned to speak up because you allowed yourself to be treated poorly, or perhaps you learned that you need to be honest if you want relationships to last. Some of the best life lessons can be learned from the toughest times you’ve endured. •    Think about the facts, not the emotion. Thinking about negative events can be very distressing because you’ll likely focus on how you felt during the event. But if you recall an event by walking yourself through the facts and details of the memory, your distress decreases. Instead of dwelling on how you felt when you went to a funeral, recall specific details about where you sat, what you wore, who was there. When you begin to take away the emotion surrounding an event, you’re less likely to dwell on it. •    Look at the situation differently. When you review your past, examine what other ways there are to look at the same situation. You have control over how you weave the story. The same story can be told countless ways and still be true. If your current version is upsetting, see how else you can look at it. For example, Gloria could have reminded herself that her daughter’s current choices weren’t all related to her childhood. She could have recognized that although she may have made some mistakes, she was not responsible for the choices her daughter was making now.</em></p>

<p><em>If you find yourself ruminating on some aspect of your past, you may need to take action to make peace with the past. Here are some ways to make peace with the past: •    Give yourself permission to move forward. Sometimes you just need to give yourself permission to move forward. Moving forward doesn’t mean you have to leave your memories of a loved one behind, but it does mean you can do the things you need to do to enjoy the moment and get the most you can out of life. •    Recognize the emotional toll of dwelling on the past versus moving forward. Sometimes dwelling on the past is a strategy that works in the short term but not in the long term. If you think about the past, you don’t have to focus on what’s going on right now. But, over the long term, there are consequences. Recognize what you’ll miss out on in life if your attention is focused on the past. •    Practice forgiveness. Whether you’re dwelling on past hurt and anger because you can’t forgive yourself or because you can’t forgive someone else, forgiveness can help you let go of that hurt. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting something happened. If someone hurt you, you can forgive them while still deciding not to have any more contact, for example. Instead, focus on letting go so you don’t stay consumed with the hurt and anger. •    Change behavior that keeps you stuck in the past. If you find yourself avoiding certain activities—because you are afraid it will drudge up bad memories or because you feel like you don’t deserve to do them—consider doing them anyway. You can’t change the past. But you can choose to accept it. If you’ve made mistakes, you can’t go back and fix them or erase them. You may be able to try and take steps to repair some of the damage you’ve caused, but it won’t make everything better. •    Seek professional help if necessary. Sometimes traumatic events can lead to mental health issues, like post-traumatic stress disorder. Near-death experiences, for example, can lead to flashbacks and nightmares that make it difficult to make peace with the past. Professional counseling can help reduce the distress associated with traumatic memories so you can move forward more productively.</em></p>

<p><em>For a long time, many teachers held the common belief that if a child was allowed to guess an answer incorrectly, she would be in danger of accidently memorizing the wrong answer. For example, if a child guessed that 4 + 4 = 6, she’d always recall 6 as the right answer, even after she was corrected. To prevent this, teachers gave kids the answers first without allowing them to make an educated guess. Fast-forward to 2012, when a research study published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition showed that as long as study participants were given a chance to learn the correct information, they could learn from previous mistakes. In fact, researchers found that when kids thought about potential answers, even if those answers were incorrect, their retention rates for the correct answers improved once their mistakes were corrected. Kids, just like adults, are able to learn from their mistakes when they’re given the opportunity. Despite the fact that we now have a study that proves we can learn from our mistakes, it is difficult to completely unlearn what we were taught when we were younger. Growing up, you may have learned it’s better to hide your mistakes than face the consequences. And school wasn’t the only place we built our understanding of handling mistakes. Celebrities, politicians, and athletes are commonly portrayed in the media as trying to cover up their missteps. They lie and attempt to talk their way out of admitting they did anything wrong even when there’s evidence to the contrary. And when we deny our mistakes, we are less likely to examine them and gain any true understanding or lessons from them, making us more susceptible to repeating them in the future. We’ve all heard this line before: “I stand by my decisions . . .” This is an acknowledgment of behavior but falls short of admitting a mistake, all because of pride.</em></p>

<p><em>Repeating the same mistakes leads to many problems, such as the following: •    You won’t reach your goals. Whether you’re trying to lose weight for the fifth time or you’re working on quitting smoking for the tenth time, if you keep repeating the same mistakes, you won’t ever reach your goals. Instead, you’ll stay stuck at the same point and won’t be able to move forward. •    The problem won’t get solved. It’s a vicious cycle. When you repeat a mistake, the problem perpetuates and you’re more likely to just keep doing the same thing. You’ll never be able to solve a problem until you do something differently. •    You’ll think differently about yourself. You may begin to view yourself as incompetent or a complete failure because you can’t get past a certain obstacle. •    You may not try as hard. If the first few attempts weren’t successful, you may be more likely to give up. When you don’t try as hard, you’re less likely to succeed. •    You may frustrate others who watch you repeat the same mistakes. If you’re guilty of always getting yourself caught up in similar problems, your friends and family may grow tired of hearing you complain. Worse yet, if they’ve had to bail you out because you’ve repeatedly gotten yourself into problematic situations, your repeated mistakes will damage your relationships. •    You may develop irrational beliefs to excuse your mistakes. Instead of looking at how your behavior is interfering with your progress, you may conclude it’s just not “meant to be.” An overweight person who struggles to lose weight and keep it off may simply decide, “I’m big-boned. I wasn’t meant to be smaller.”</em></p>

<p><em>Look for an explanation without making an excuse. Ask yourself the following questions: •    What went wrong? Spend a little bit of time reflecting on your mistakes. Try to discern the facts about what happened. Maybe you overspend on your budget every month because you can’t resist shopping. Or maybe you get into the same argument with your spouse repeatedly because the issue never really resolves itself. Examine what thoughts, behaviors, and external factors contributed to the mistake. •    What could I have done better? As you reflect on the situation, look for things you could have done better. Maybe you didn’t stick with something long enough. For example, maybe you gave up on trying to lose weight after only two weeks. Or maybe your mistake is that you find too many excuses about why you shouldn’t exercise and as a result, you just don’t stick with an effective weight-loss routine. Give yourself an honest evaluation. •    What can I do differently next time? Saying you’re not going to make a mistake again and actually doing it are two very separate things. Think about what you can do differently next time to avoid making the same mistake. Identify clear strategies you can use to avoid resorting to your old behavior.</em></p>

<p><em>Follow these steps to create a written plan that will help you avoid repeating your mistakes: 1.    Establish behavior that will replace previous behavior. Instead of drinking alcohol to cope with stress, a person could identify alternative strategies, such as going for a walk or calling a friend. Decide what healthy behavior will help you avoid repeating unhealthy behavior. 2.    Identify warning signs that you’re headed down the wrong path again. It’s important to be on the lookout for old behavior patterns that may return. Perhaps you’ll know your spending habits are getting out of control again when you begin putting purchases on credit cards. 3.    Find a way to hold yourself accountable. It’ll be more difficult to hide your mistakes or ignore them when you’re being held accountable. Talking to a trusted friend or relative who is willing to hold you accountable and point out your blunders can be helpful. You may also be able to increase the likelihood that you’ll hold yourself accountable by keeping a journal or using a calendar to chart your progress.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are some things to keep in mind when working to increase your self-control: •    Practice tolerating discomfort. Whether you’re feeling lonely and you’re tempted to text message that ex who isn’t good for you or you’re craving a sweet treat that will blow your diet, practice tolerating the discomfort. Although people often convince themselves if they “give in just this once” it will help, research shows otherwise. Each time you give in you reduce your self-control. •    Use positive self-talk. Realistic affirmations can help you resist temptation in moments of weakness. Saying things like “I can do this” or “I’m doing a great job working toward my goals” can help you stay on track. •    Keep your goals in mind. Focusing on the importance of your goals helps decrease temptations. So if you focus on how good you’ll feel when your car is paid off, you’ll be less tempted to make that purchase that will wreak havoc on the month’s budget. •    Impose restrictions on yourself. If you know you’re likely to spend too much money when you’re out with friends, only take a small amount of cash with you. Take steps that make it difficult, if not impossible, for you to give in when you’re faced with temptation. •    Create a list of all the reasons why you don’t want to repeat your mistake. Carry this list with you. When you’re tempted to resort to your previous behavior pattern, read this list to yourself. It can increase your motivation to resist repeating old patterns. For example, create a list of reasons why you should go for a walk after dinner. When you’re tempted to watch TV instead of exercise, read the list and it may increase your motivation to move forward.</em></p>

<p><em>Hershey worked tirelessly on perfecting his chocolate formula. He quickly became the only person in the United States to mass-produce milk chocolate, and soon he began selling chocolate all over the world. When sugar became scarce during World War I, Hershey established his own sugar refinery in Cuba. But as soon as the war ended, the sugar market collapsed. Once again, Hershey found himself in financial trouble. He borrowed money from the bank, but he had to mortgage his properties until the loan was paid off. Nevertheless, Hershey managed to get his business back in order and he paid off the loan within two years. Not only did he build a thriving chocolate factory, but he created a thriving town. During the Great Depression, Hershey was able to keep his employees working. He created a variety of buildings in the town, including a school, a sports arena, and a hotel. The new construction employed many people. Throughout all his success, he also became a great philanthropist. Hershey’s ability to learn from his mistakes helped him go from running failed candy businesses to owning the world’s biggest chocolate company. Even today, the town known as Hershey, Pennsylvania, is adorned with streetlights in the shape of Hershey’s Kisses, and over three million visitors tour the Hershey’s world chocolate factory to learn how Milton Hershey made chocolate go from a bean to a bar. When you view mistakes not as something negative but instead as an opportunity to improve yourself, you’ll be able to devote time and energy into making sure you don’t repeat them. In fact, mentally strong people are often willing to share their mistakes with other people in an effort to help prevent them from making the same mistakes.</em></p>

<p><em>Dan agreed to attend a few more therapy sessions, and over the next few weeks his resentment toward his neighbors became apparent. When we explored some of the reasons why he was so angry with his neighbors, Dan revealed that he had grown up poor and he never wanted his children to feel like he did as a child. He’d been teased and bullied because his family couldn’t afford expensive clothing or toys like the other kids had. So he prided himself on keeping up with other people so he could offer his family a comparable lifestyle to those around him. Deep down, however, Dan valued time with his family more than his possessions. And the more we talked about the type of lifestyle he was living, the more disgusted he felt with himself. He knew he’d rather spend time with his family than work overtime to buy them more things. Slowly, Dan began to change the way he thought about his behavior, and he focused more on his own goals and his own values, rather than keeping up with the neighbors.</em></p>

<p><em>Sometimes an injustice is real, and at other times, it’s imagined. Dan felt it wasn’t fair that his neighbors were making a lot of money. He was fixated on the fact that they had more money and nicer possessions than he could afford. He blamed his neighbors for making him feel poor, but had he lived in a less affluent neighborhood, he may have felt rich. Resentment of others’ success is also a result of deep-rooted insecurities. It’s hard to be happy about a friend’s accomplishments when you feel bad about yourself. When you’re insecure, someone else’s success will seem to magnify your shortcomings. You might also become bitter when you wrongfully assume that good fortune comes more easily to others when you’re the more deserving one. It’s easy to resent what others have when you don’t even know what you want yourself. Someone who never wanted a job that requires travel may look at a friend who goes on international business trips and think, She’s so lucky. I want to do that. Meanwhile, he may also covet the lifestyle of another friend who operates a home-based business that prevents him from traveling and think, I wish I could do that, even though these two lifestyles are conflicting.

Researchers showed participants photographs of four different people—an elderly person, a student, a drug addict, and a rich professional. They studied participants’ brain activities while pairing the images with various events. They discovered that the participants showed the most glee when the rich professional experienced problems, like getting soaked by a taxi. In fact, people enjoyed that scenario even more than scenarios where any of the individuals received good fortune.

The more time you spend focusing on someone else’s achievements, the less time you have to work on your own goals. Animosity over someone else’s achievements only serves as a distraction that will slow down your progress. •    You’ll never be content with what you have.

You’ll never be satisfied because there will always be someone who has more money, who is more attractive, and who appears to have everything all together. •    You’ll overlook your skills and talents. The more time you spend wishing you could do what someone else does, the less time you’ll focus on sharpening your own skills. Wishing that other people lacked talent won’t improve your talent. •    You may abandon your values. Resentment can cause people to behave in a desperate manner. It’s hard to stay true to your values when you feel a lot of anger toward people who have things you don’t. Unfortunately, resentment can lead people to behave in a manner they normally wouldn’t—like sabotage someone else’s efforts or go into debt to try and keep up. •    You may damage relationships. When you resent someone, you won’t be able to maintain a healthy relationship with him or her. Resentment leads to indirect communication, sarcasm, and irritability that is often hidden under a fake smile.

<p><em>you find yourself resenting other people, use these strategies to change your thoughts: •    Avoid comparing yourself to other people. Comparing yourself to others is like comparing apples and oranges. You have your own set of unique talents, skills, and life experiences, so comparing yourself to other people isn’t an accurate way to measure your self-worth. Instead, compare yourself to who you used to be and measure how you’re growing as an individual. •    Develop an awareness of your stereotypes. Work on getting to know people instead of automatically judging them based on stereotypes. Don’t allow yourself to assume that someone who has gained wealth, fame, or whatever else you may envy is somehow evil. •    Stop emphasizing your weaknesses. If you focus on all the things you don’t have or can’t do, you may set yourself up to resent the people who do possess those things. Focus on your strengths, skills, and abilities. •    Quit magnifying other people’s strengths. Resentment often derives from exaggerating how great other people are doing and focusing on everything that they have. Remember that each person also has weaknesses, insecurities, and problems—even those who are successful. •    Don’t insult other people’s accomplishments. Diminishing someone else’s accomplishments will only breed feelings of resentment. Avoid saying things like “His promotion actually wasn’t a big deal. And he only got it because he’s friends with the boss.” •    Stop trying to determine what’s fair. Don’t allow yourself to focus on things that aren’t fair. Unfortunately, sometimes people cheat to get ahead. And some people may become successful simply based on chance. But the more time you devote to thinking about who is “deserving” of success and who isn’t, the less time you’ll have to devote to something productive.</em></p>

<p><em>As long as you view the people in your life as competitors, you’ll always focus on trying to “win.” And you can’t have healthy relationships with people when you’re only thinking about how to beat them, rather than build them up. Spend some time examining those in your life whom you view as your competition. Perhaps you want to be more attractive than your best friend. Or you want to have more money than your brother. Take notice of how viewing these people as your competition really isn’t healthy to your relationship. What if, instead, you began to view them as on your team? Including people in your life who possess a variety of skills and talents can actually work to your advantage. If you’ve got a brother who is good with money, instead of trying to buy just as many expensive toys as he has, why not learn from his financial tips? If you’ve got a neighbor who is health conscious, why not ask her to share some recipes? Behaving in a humble manner can do wonders for how you feel about yourself, as well as other people.</em></p>

<p><em>Fear is often at the heart of our unwillingness to try something again after we’ve failed at it already, but not everyone shares the same fears about failure. One person may worry that he’ll disappoint his parents while another person may worry that she’s too fragile to handle another setback. Rather than facing these fears, many people simply avoid risking another failure, which we associate with shame. Some of us try to hide our failures; others devote a lot of energy into making excuses for them. A student may say, “I didn’t have time to study for this test at all,” even though she devoted many hours of her time preparing, just to cover up the fact that she did poorly. Another student may hide his test score from his parents because he’s ashamed that he didn’t do well. In other instances, we allow failure to define who we are. To Susan, her failure to finish college meant she wasn’t smart enough to get an education. Someone may believe one failure in business means he was never destined to be an entrepreneur, or an individual who fails to publish his first book may conclude he’s a poor writer. Giving up can also be a learned behavior. Perhaps as a child, your mother swooped in to help you accomplish any task you weren’t able to do on the first try. Or maybe when you told your teacher you couldn’t figure out your math work, she gave you the answers so you never really had to figure it out for yourself. Always expecting someone else to come to our rescue can be a hard habit to break, even into adulthood, making it less likely that we’ll be willing to try again if we fail.</em></p>

<p><em>If you refuse to try again after you fail once, it’s likely you have developed some inaccurate or unproductive beliefs about failure. Those beliefs influence the way you think, feel, and behave toward failure. Here’s what the research says about perseverance and failure: •    Deliberate practice is more important than natural talent. Although we’re often led to believe that we’re either gifted with natural-born talent or we aren’t, most talents can be cultivated through hard work. Research studies have found that after ten years of daily practice, people can surpass others with natural talent in chess, sports, music, and the visual arts. After twenty years of dedicated practice, many people who lack natural talent can gain world-class achievement. But often we believe if we weren’t born with a specific gift, we won’t ever be able to develop enough talent to become successful. This belief can cause you to give up before you’ve had a chance to cultivate the skills necessary to succeed. •    Grit is a better predictor of success than IQ. Clearly, not everyone with a high IQ reaches a high level of achievement. In fact, a person’s IQ isn’t a very good predictor of whether he or she will become successful. Grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, has been shown to be a much more accurate predictor of achievement than IQ. •    Attributing failure to a lack of ability leads to learned helplessness. If you think that your failure is caused by a lack of ability—and you think you can’t improve upon that ability—you’re likely to develop a sense of learned helplessness. Instead of trying again after you fail, you’ll either give up or wait for someone else to do it for you. If you think you can’t improve, you likely won’t try to get better. Don’t allow inaccurate beliefs about your abilities to hold you back from becoming successful. Spend some time thinking about your beliefs surrounding failure.

<p><em>Here are some thoughts about failure that will likely discourage you from trying again: •    Failure is unacceptable. •    I’m either a complete success or a complete failure. •    Failure is always all my fault. •    I failed because I’m bad. •    People won’t like me if I fail. •    If I couldn’t do something right the first time, I won’t be able to do it right the second time. •    I’m not good enough to succeed. Irrational thoughts about failure may cause you to quit after your first failed attempt. Work on replacing them with more realistic thoughts. Failure isn’t likely as bad as you make it out to be in your mind. Focus on your efforts instead of the outcome. When you’re trying to complete a difficult task, focus on what you could gain from the challenge. Can you learn something new? Can you improve your skills even if you aren’t initially successful? By thinking about what you can learn from the experience, you’ll be more likely to accept that failure is part of the process.</em></p>

<p><em>Self-compassion, and not necessarily high self-esteem, may be the key to reaching your full potential. While being too hard on yourself can lead to the resignation that you’re just not good enough, and being too easy on yourself may lead to excuses for your behavior, self-compassion strikes just the right balance. Self-compassion means viewing your failures kindly yet realistically. It means understanding that everyone has shortcomings, including you, and that failure doesn’t decrease your worth as a person. When you take a compassionate approach to your own weaknesses, you’ll be more likely to recognize there is room to grow and improve. In a 2012 study titled “Self-Compassion Increased Self-Improvement Motivation,” students were given a chance to improve failed test scores. One group of students took a self-compassionate view of their failure while the other group focused on bolstering their self-esteem. The results found that the students who practiced self-compassion studied 25 percent longer and scored higher on the second test compared with the students who focused on increasing their self-esteem.</em></p>

<p><em>While most private pilots would have waited, holding a sign that read their customer’s name, that wasn’t Rob’s style. Instead, when his passenger stepped off the plane, Rob shook his hand and said, “Great to meet you, Mr. Smith. I’ll be your pilot today.” Mr. Smith responded by saying how flattered he was that Rob recognized him right away. But what Mr. Smith didn’t know was that Rob had actually shaken every man’s hand as he stepped off the plane and uttered the exact same words, “Great to meet you, Mr. Smith.” If the person looked confused or said he wasn’t Mr. Smith, Rob simply moved on to greet the next person until he eventually found Mr. Smith. I think many people would be embarrassed if they greeted someone by the wrong name, and they may shy away from greeting strangers so robustly in the future. But not Rob. He’d happily shake a stranger’s hand and call him by the wrong name. He knew that he’d eventually find Mr. Smith. He wasn’t afraid of failing over and over again until he got it right. If you get used to failing, it becomes a lot less scary, especially once you learn that failure and rejection aren’t the worst things that could happen to you.</em></p>

<p><em>Although solitude has plenty of positive connotations among the major religions—Jesus, Muhammad, and Buddha were all described as appreciating solitude—being alone has developed some negative associations in modern society. Extreme cases of solitude, such as someone characterized as a “hermit,” are often portrayed negatively in cartoons, fairy tales, and movies. Jokes about becoming “the old cat lady” also serve as gentle suggestions that “being alone makes you go crazy.” Parents place kids in time-outs when they misbehave, which sends the message that being alone is a punishment. And the term “solitary confinement” is used to describe consequences for the worst-of-the-worst prison inmates. Although extreme solitude clearly isn’t healthy, being alone seems to have received such a bad rap that even short durations of alone time can be viewed as unpleasant. The notion that “being alone is bad” and “being surrounded by people is good” pressures us to fill our social calendars. Sometimes there’s the impression that sitting home alone on a Saturday night isn’t healthy or it means you’re a “loser.” Keeping an overbooked calendar also helps people feel important. The more your phone rings, and the more plans you make, the more important you must be. Staying busy also serves as a wonderful distraction. If you have problems you don’t want to address, why not invite your neighbors over for dinner or go shopping with some friends? After all, you won’t have to think about your problems as long as you keep your brain occupied with pleasant conversation. Even if you can’t spend time with other people physically, advances in technology mean that you don’t ever really have to be alone. You can talk on the phone almost anywhere, use social media to be in constant contact with people, and send text messages the second you have a spare moment. You can virtually avoid being alone with your thoughts almost every minute of the day.</em></p>

<p><em>Being alone often gets confused with being lonely. Feelings of loneliness have been linked to poor sleep, high blood pressure, weaker immune systems, and increased stress hormones. But being alone doesn’t necessarily cause loneliness. In fact, many people feel lonely when they’re surrounded by others in a crowded room.

<p><em>Unfortunately, the benefits of solitude are often ignored or minimized. Here’s what the research says are some of the major benefits that those of us who fear alone time might be missing out on: •    Moderate alone time is good for kids. A 1997 study called “The Emergence of Solitude as a Constructive Domain of Experience in Early Adolescence” found that fifth to ninth graders who spent moderate amounts of time alone were less likely to exhibit behavioral problems. They also scored lower on depression rating scales and had higher grade point averages. •    Solitude at the office can increase productivity. Although many office settings promote open work spaces and large brainstorming sessions, a 2000 study called “Cognitive Stimulation in Brainstorming” found that most people in the study performed better when they had some privacy. Spending some time away from everyone has been linked to increased productivity. •    Alone time may increase your empathy. When people spend time by themselves, they’re more likely to show compassion for others. If you’re spending a lot of time with your social circle, you’re more likely to develop a “we vs. them” mentality, which can cause you to behave less compassionately toward those outside your social circle. •    Spending time alone sparks creativity. Many successful artists, writers, and musicians credit solitude with improving their performance, and some research suggests that spending time away from the demands of society can boost creativity. •    Solitary skills are good for mental health. Although there’s often a lot of emphasis on the importance of social skills, evidence suggests solitary skills may be equally important for health and well-being. The ability to tolerate alone time has been linked to increased happiness, life satisfaction, and improved stress management. People who enjoy alone time also experience less depression. •    Solitude offers restoration. Alone time provides an opportunity to recharge your batteries. Research shows that spending time alone in nature offers rest and renewal.</em></p>

Take a few moments every day to think about your personal or professional goals. Evaluate how you’re doing and think about any changes you may want to make. •    Pay attention to your feelings. Check in with yourself about how you’re feeling both physically and emotionally. Think about your stress level. Evaluate whether you’re taking good enough care of yourself and think about any ways you could improve your life. •    Set goals for the future. Don’t stop dreaming about what you may want the future to look like. The first step to creating the type of life you want is deciding how you want the future to look. •    Write in a journal. Journaling can be a powerful tool in helping you to better understand and learn from your emotions.

A 2011 research study titled “An Exercise to Teach the Psychological Benefits of Solitude: The Date with the Self” found that the vast majority of people who scheduled a date alone experienced calmness and serenity. They enjoyed the freedom to do whatever they wanted without any social constraints or expectations. The few participants who didn’t find the experience enjoyable weren’t yet comfortable being alone. However, increasing their exposure to alone time may help make it a more enjoyable activity for them in the future. While fishing in a boat in the middle of a lake may offer one person a peaceful and rejuvenating experience, many other people would find the exercise to be dreadful.

Notice as your mind will likely begin to wander along the way. Refocus your attention back to slowly counting. •    Consciously Observe—Find an everyday object you have lying around the house, like a pen or a cup. Hold the object in your hands and focus all your attention onto it. Observe how it looks and how it feels in your hands without passing any assessments or judgments. Instead, try to focus on the here and now. •    Eat a Mindful Bite of Food—Take a small piece of food, such as a raisin or a nut, and explore it with as many senses as possible. Look at it and notice the texture and color. Next, observe how it feels in your hand. Then, pay attention to how it smells. Now put it in your mouth and taste it.

<p><em>Learning skills to quiet your mind and be alone with your thoughts can be a powerful and life-changing experience. In his book 10% Happier, Dan Harris describes how meditation changed his life. As the coanchor of ABC’s Nightline and a weekend anchor for Good Morning America, he needed to present his best self live on the air every day. But one day he suffered a panic attack in the middle of reading a news report. As he became overwhelmed with sudden anxiety, he struggled to speak and grew short of breath, forcing him to cut the segment short. He later learned that his panic attack—which he refers to as the most embarrassing moment of his life—likely resulted from his attempts to self-medicate his recent depression with ecstasy and cocaine. Even though he hadn’t gotten high for weeks, the effects had lingered in his brain. The panic attack motivated him to quit self-medicating and he began a new quest to find out how to manage his stress. Around the same time, Harris was assigned to report on a series about religion. As part of the assignment, he was introduced to meditation. Although he initially felt that meditation wouldn’t be anything he’d ever be interested in, the more he learned, the more open-minded he became. Eventually, he discovered firsthand how meditation could provide him with realistic strategies to calm the anxious thoughts in his head. Although he acknowledges he was initially uncomfortable with telling people he’d started meditating, he recognizes how much sharing his story could help other people. He’s clear that meditation didn’t magically fix everything in his life, but he says it improved his mood by 10 percent. In his book he says, “Until we look directly at our minds we don’t really know what our lives are about.”</em></p>

Following the meeting, Lucas had gone to his company’s Human Resources office to complain and it was then that they recommended he receive some counseling. As Lucas and I talked, he said he felt like he deserved a promotion. Even though he was new to the company, he was certain he had great ideas about how to make the business more profitable and he figured he should be paid more than his current salary. We explored his assumption that he was an extremely valuable employee and how his employer might see things differently. We also discussed the consequences of making such a bold assumption.

<p><em>We live in a world where rights and privileges frequently get confused. Often, people think they have a “right to be happy” or a “right to be treated respectfully,” even if it means they have to infringe on others’ rights to get what they want. Instead of trying to earn privileges, they behave as if society is somehow indebted to them. Advertising tempts us to buy products by promoting self-indulgence and materialism. The idea that “You deserve it,” whether you can afford it or not, leads many among us to go deeply into debt. A feeling that the world owes you something isn’t always about a sense of superiority. Sometimes it is about a sense of injustice. A person who had a difficult childhood, for example, may max out his credit cards as he buys himself all the things he never had as a kid. He may think the world owes him the opportunity to have nice things, since he missed out on a lot as a youngster.

You won’t be able to accept responsibility for your behavior when you’re focused on trying to stake your claim over what you think the world owes you. You’ll also make unrealistic demands of people or be too focused on gaining what you think you deserve to be able to contribute to a relationship in a meaningful way. If you are always demanding, “I deserve to be cared for and treated well,” you may have trouble offering the type of love and respect that will attract a partner who treats you kindly. When you’re focused on yourself, it is extremely challenging to be empathetic. Why donate time and money to other people if you’re always thinking things like I deserve to buy nice things for myself? Instead of experiencing the joy of giving, you’ll be too fixated on what you’re not getting. When you don’t get everything you want entitlement can lead to feelings of bitterness as you’ll think you were somehow victimized.

If you don’t land that dream job, the common reaction from friends is usually something along the lines of “Well, something better will come your way” or “You deserve something good to happen to you after all this.” But even though these statements are made with the best of intentions, the world doesn’t really work like that. No matter whether you’re the smartest person on the planet or you’ve persevered through life’s roughest circumstances, you don’t become more deserving of good fortune than anyone else. Try to become more aware of these subtle moments of entitlement.

If someone offers you feedback, don’t be quick to say, “Well, that person is stupid.” Their feedback is based on how they perceive you, which of course is likely to be different from how you perceive yourself. Be willing to evaluate criticism and consider whether you want to change your behavior. •    Acknowledge your flaws and weaknesses. Everyone has flaws and weaknesses, whether we like to admit them or not. Recognizing that you have insecurities, problems, and unattractive characteristics about yourself can ensure you don’t develop an inflated self-perception. Just don’t use those weaknesses as an excuse about why the world owes you more. •    Stop and think about how other people feel. Rather than focusing on what you think you deserve in life, take time to think about how other people may feel. Increasing empathy for others can decrease your inflated sense of self-importance. •    Don’t keep score. Whether you were able to successfully give up a drug addiction or you helped an elderly person across the street, the world doesn’t owe you anything in return.

<p><em>Several other therapists and I used to facilitate a parenting group. The parents who attended mostly had preschool-age children, and the most common behavior problem they wanted addressed was temper tantrums. Of course, young children are notorious for their abilities to throw themselves down on the ground, scream, and kick when they’re not getting what they want. So as part of the program, parents were encouraged to ignore attention-seeking behaviors. Despite warnings that behaviors would sometimes get worse before they got better, parents frequently became convinced that ignoring just didn’t work. When asked how they knew it wasn’t working, they’d say things like, “He just started screaming louder” or “She got up and ran over to me and threw herself back on the ground to continue her tantrum right in front of me!” What these parents hadn’t yet realized was that their attempts at ignoring were working. The kids were getting the message that their parents weren’t going to give in to them anymore, and these savvy little four-year-olds were upping their game. They figured if Mom or Dad wasn’t giving in when they screamed a little, they’d better scream louder to get what they wanted. And each time parents gave in, it reinforced the kids’ temper tantrums. But if parents could ignore attention-seeking behaviors consistently, their kids would learn that temper tantrums weren’t an effective way to get what they wanted. Parents often needed reassurance that just because their child’s behavior seemed to be getting worse, it didn’t mean their parenting strategies weren’t effective.</em></p>

<p><em>Forgoing instant gratification requires constant vigilance. Here are some strategies to help you delay gratification and prevent you from expecting immediate results: •    Keep your eyes on the prize. Keep your end goal in mind to stay motivated on the days when you feel like giving up. Remind yourself of your goal in creative ways. Write down what you want to accomplish on a note and hang it on the wall or make it your computer screensaver. Visualize yourself meeting your goal each day and it will help you stay motivated. •    Celebrate milestones along your journey. You don’t have to wait until you reach your goal before you celebrate your accomplishments. Instead, create short-term objectives and celebrate when you reach each milestone. Even something as small as going out to dinner with family can help you acknowledge your progress along the way. •    Create a plan to resist temptation. There are always opportunities to give in to immediate gratification. If you’re trying to lose weight, there will be sweet treats to throw you off your diet. And if you’re trying to stick to a budget, nice toys and luxuries will always be there to tempt you. Create a plan ahead of time that will help you steer clear of temptations that may throw you off course and prevent you from becoming successful. •    Deal with feelings of frustration and impatience in a healthy manner. Some days you will feel like giving up, questioning whether you should continue. Just because you feel angry, disappointed, and frustrated doesn’t mean you should quit. Instead, find healthy ways to cope with those feelings and expect that they will be part of the process. •    Pace yourself. No matter what you’re doing, you’ll be at risk for burnout if you expect immediate results. Pace yourself so you can be methodical in your attempts to move toward reaching your goals. Learning the value of a slow and steady pace can help you gain patience and ensure that you’re on the right track rather than rushing as fast as you can to get what you want.</em></p>

Here’s what the research says about the benefits of delayed gratification: •    Self-discipline is more important than IQ when it comes to predicting academic success. •    College students’ self-control scores correlate with higher self-esteem, higher grade point averages, less binge eating and alcohol abuse, and better interpersonal skills. •    The ability to delay gratification is associated with lower rates of depression and anxiety. •    Children with high self-control have fewer mental and physical health problems, fewer substance-abuse problems, fewer criminal convictions, and greater financial security as adults. Whether your goal is to save enough money to go on vacation next year or you’re devoted to raising children who will become responsible adults, establish realistic expectations for yourself and don’t expect to see results tomorrow. Instead, be willing to commit to the long haul and you’ll increase the chances that you’ll be able to reach your goals.</em></p>

<p><em>COACH YOURSELF Just like any good coach should provide a combination of support and advice to help you get better, be willing to do that for yourself. Look at what you’re doing well and build on your strengths. Identify areas that need improvement and challenge yourself to get better. Create opportunities for growth but understand that you’ll never be perfect. Try to improve a little each day by following these steps: •    Monitor Your Behavior—Look for times when your behavior sabotages your efforts to build mental strength; for example, repeating the same mistakes, shying away from change, or giving up after the first failure. Then identify strategies to help you behave in a more productive manner. •    Regulate Your Emotions—Be on the lookout for times when you’re feeling sorry for yourself, fearing calculated risks, feeling like the world owes you something, fearing alone time, resenting other people’s success, or worrying about pleasing everyone. Don’t allow those types of feelings to hold you back from reaching your full potential. Remember, if you want to change how you feel, you have to change how you think and behave. •    Think About Your Thoughts—It takes some extra effort and energy to really evaluate your thoughts. But overly positive or exaggeratedly negative thoughts will influence how you feel and behave and can interfere with your quest for mental strength. Examine whether your thoughts are realistic before determining a course of action so you can make the best decisions for yourself. Identify beliefs and thoughts that will hold you back, such as those that encourage you to give away your power, waste energy on things you can’t control, dwell on the past, or expect immediate results. Replace them with more realistic and productive thoughts.</em></p>

<p><em>Although acquiring mental strength is a personal journey, you don’t have to go it completely alone. It’s hard to become your best self without help from other people. Ask for help when you need it and surround yourself with supportive people. Sometimes, other people can offer tips and strategies about what helps them and you may be able to apply those to your life in a way that helps you along your journey. If you find that your friends and family aren’t able to provide you with the type of support that you need, seek professional help. A trained counselor can assist you in your efforts to create change. As your mental strength increases, you’ll become more aware that not everyone is as interested in increasing their mental strength. Clearly, you can’t force anyone else to change his or her life, that’s up to that individual. But rather than complain about people who aren’t mentally strong, commit to being a healthy role model for others. Teach your children how to be mentally strong because clearly, they’re not learning these skills in the outside world. But if you work on striving to be your best, people around you, including your children, will take notice.</em></p>
