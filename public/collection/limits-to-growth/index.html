<h1>Limits to Growth (Donella H. Meadows;Jorgen Randers;Dennis Meadows)</h1><p> May. 25, 2020</p>


<br/><br/>



<p><em>^o overshoot means to go too far, to go beyond limits accidentally- without intention. People experience overshoots every day. When you rise too quickly from a chair, you may momentarily lose your balance. If you turn on the hot-water faucet too far in the shower, you may be scalded. On an icy road your car might slide past a stop sign. At a party you may drink much more alcohol than your body can safely metabolize; in the morning you will have a ferocious headache. Construction companies periodically build more condominiums than are demanded, forcing them to sell units below cost and confront the possibility of bankruptcy. Too many fishing boats are often constructed. Then fishing fleets grow so large that they catch far more than the sustainable harvest. This depletes the fish population and forces ships to remain in harbor. Chemical companies have produced more chlorinated chemicals than the upper atmosphere can safely assimilate. Now the ozone layer will be dangerously depleted for decades until stratospheric chlorine levels decline. The three causes of overshoot are always the same, at any scale from personal to planetary. First, there is growth, acceleration, rapid change. Second, there is some form of limit or barrier, beyond which the moving system may not safely go. Third, there is a delay or mistake in the perceptions and the responses that strive to keep the system within its limits. These three are necessary and sufficient to produce an overshoot.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 282-292)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The delays, too, arise in many ways. They may result from inattention, faulty data, delayed information, slow reflexes, a cumbersome or quarreling bureaucracy, a false theory about how the system responds, or from momentum that prevents the system from being stopped quickly despite the best efforts to halt it. For example, delays may result when a driver does not realize how much his car’s braking traction has been reduced by ice on the road; the contractor uses current prices to make decisions about construction activity that will affect the market two or three years in the future; the fishing fleet owners base their decisions on data about recent catch, not information about the future rate of fish reproduction; chemicals require years to migrate from where they are used to a point in the ecosystem where cause severe damage. Most instances of overshoot cause little harm. Being past many kinds of limits does not expose anyone to serious damage. Most types of overshoot occur frequently enough that when they are potentially dangerous, people learn to avoid them or to minimize their consequences. For example, you test the water temperature with your hand before stepping into the shower stall. Sometimes there is damage, but it is quickly corrected: Most people try to sleep extra long in the morning after a late night drinking in the bar. Occasionally, however, there arises the potential for catastrophic overshoot. Growth in the globe’s population and material economy confronts humanity with this possibility.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Throughout this text we will grapple with the difficulties of understanding and describing the causes and consequences of a population and economy that have grown past the support capacities of the earth. The issues involved are complex. The relevant data are often poor in quality and incomplete. The available science has not yet produced consensus among researchers, much less among politicians. Nonetheless, we need a term that refers to the relation between humanity’s demands on the planet and the globe’s capacity to provide. For this purpose we will use the phrase ecological footprint. The term was popularized by a study Mathis Wackernagel and his colleagues conducted for the Earth Council in 1997. Wackernagel calculated the amount of land that would be required to provide the natural resources consumed by the population of various nations and to absorb their wastes.’ Wackernagel’s term and mathematical approach were later adopted by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), which provides semiannual data on the ecological footprint of more than 150 nations in its Living Planet Report.2 According to these data, since the late 1980s the earth’s peoples have been using more of the planet’s resource production each year than could be regenerated in that year. In other words, the ecological footprint of global society has overshot the earth’s capacity to provide. There is much information to support this conclusion. We will discuss it further in chapter 3. The potential consequences of this overshoot are profoundly dangerous. The situation is unique; it confronts humanity with a variety of issues never before experienced by our species on a global scale. We lack the perspectives, the cultural norms, the habits, and the institutions required to cope. And the damage will, in many cases, take centuries or millennia to correct.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 21 (location ~ 307-320)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We believe that a correction is possible and that it could lead to a desirable, sustainable, sufficient future for all the world’s peoples. We also believe that if a profound correction is not made soon, a crash of some sort is certain. And it will occur within the lifetimes of many who are alive today. These are enormous claims. How did we arrive at them? Over the past 30 years we have worked with many colleagues to understand the long-term causes and consequences of growth in human population and in its ecological footprint. We have approached these issues in four ways-in effect using four different lenses to focus on data in different ways, just as the lenses of a microscope and a telescope give different perspectives. Three of these viewing devices are widely used and easy to describe: (1) standard scientific and economic theories about the global system; (2) data on the world’s resources and environment; and (3) a computer model to help us integrate that information and project its implications. Much of this book expands on those three lenses. It describes how we used them and what they allowed us to see. Our fourth device is our “worldview,” an internally consistent set of beliefs, attitudes, and values-a paradigm, a fundamental way of looking at reality. Everybody has a worldview; it influences where they look and what they see. It functions as a filter; it admits information consistent with their (often subconscious) expectations about the nature of the world; it leads them to disregard information that challenges or disconfirms those expectations.</em></p>

When people look out through a filter, such as a pane of colored glass, they usually see through it, rather than seeing it-and so, too, with worldviews. A worldview doesn’t need to be described to people who already share it, and it is difficult to describe to people who don’t. But it is crucial to remember that every book, every computer model, every public statement is shaped at least as much by the worldview of its authors as by any “objective” data or analysis.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Like any viewpoint-for example, the top of any hill-a systems perspective lets people see some things they would never have noticed from any other vantage point, and it may block the view of other things. Our training concentrated on dynamic systems-on sets of interconnected material and immaterial elements that change over time. Our training taught us to see the world as a set of unfolding behavior patterns, such as growth, decline, oscillation, overshoot. It has taught us to focus not so much on single pieces of a system as on connections. We see the many elements of demography, economy, and the environment as one planetary system, with innumerable interactions. We see stocks and flows and feedbacks and thresholds in the interconnections, all of which influence the way the system will behave in the future and influence the actions we might take to change its behavior. The systems perspective is by no means the only useful way to see the world, but it is one we find particularly informative. It lets us approach problems in new ways and discover unsuspected options. We intend to share some of its concepts here, so you can see what we see and form your own conclusions about the state of the world and the choices for the future. The structure of this book follows the logic of our global systems analysis. We have already made the basic point. Overshoot comes from the combination of (1) rapid change, (2) limits to that change, and (3) errors or delays in perceiving the limits and controlling the change. We will look at the global situation in that order: first at the driving factors that produce rapid global change, then at planetary limits, then at the processes through which human society learns about and responds to those limits.</em></p>

<p><em>World population has been growing exponentially since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Note the shape of the curve and the increasing change as time goes on; these are hallmarks of exponential growth. The rate of growth is now falling, however; the curve is becoming less steep in a way that is just barely visible. In 2001 the world population growth rate was 1.3 percent per year, corresponding to a doubling time of 55 years. (Sources: PRB; UN; D. Bogue.)</em></p>

<p><em>World industrial production, relative to the base year 1963, shows clear exponential increase, despite fluctuations due to oil price shocks and financial downturns. The growth rate over the past 25 years has averaged 2.9 percent per year, a doubling time of 25 years. The per capita growth rate has been slower, however, because of growth in population-only 1.3 percent per year, a doubling time of 55 years. (Sources: UN; PRB.)</em></p>

<p><em>The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from roughly 270 parts per million (ppm) to more than 370 ppm and continues on its growth path. The sources of the carbon dioxide buildup are principally human fossil fuel burning and forest destruction. The consequence is global climate change. (Sources: UNEP; U.S. DoE.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 26 (location ~ 385-387)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Growth can solve some problems, but it creates others. That is because of limits, the subject of chapter 3. The Earth is finite. Growth of anything physical, including the human population and its cars and houses and factories, cannot continue forever. But the limits to growth are not limits to the number of people, cars, houses, or factories, at least not directly. They are limits to throughput-to the continuous flows of energy and materials needed to keep people, cars, houses, and factories functioning. They are limits to the rate at which humanity can extract resources (crops, grass, wood, fish) and emit wastes (greenhouse gases, toxic substances) without exceeding the productive or absorptive capacities of the world.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 26 (location ~ 388-392)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The population and economy depend upon air, water, food, materials, and fossil fuels from the earth. They emit wastes and pollution back to the earth. Sources include mineral deposits, aquifers, and the stock of nutrients in soils; among the sinks are the atmosphere, surface water bodies, and landfills. The physical limits to growth are limits to the ability of planetary sources to provide materials and energy and to the ability of planetary sinks to absorb the pollution and waste. In chapter 3 we examine the status of the earth’s sources and sinks. The data we present there make two points. One point is bad news; the other is good. The bad news is that many crucial sources are emptying or degrading, and many sinks are filling up or overflowing. The throughput flows presently generated by the human economy cannot be maintained at their current rates for very much longer. Some sources and sinks are sufficiently stressed that they are already beginning to limit growth by, for instance, raising costs, increasing pollution burdens, and elevating the mortality rate. The good news is that current high rates of throughput are not necessary to support a decent standard of living for all the world’s people. The ecological footprint could be reduced by lowering population, altering consumption norms, or implementing more resource-efficient technologies. These changes are possible. Humanity has the knowledge necessary to maintain adequate levels of final goods and services while reducing greatly the burden on the planet. In theory there are many possible ways to bring the human ecological footprint back down below its limits.</em></p>

<p><em>The result of those simulations is, in nearly every scenario, overshoot and collapse of the planet’s economy and population. But not all scenarios show collapse. In chapter 5 we tell the best story we know about humanity’s ability to look ahead, sense a limit, and pull back before experiencing disaster. We describe the international response to the news in the 1980s of a deteriorating stratospheric ozone layer. The story is important for two reasons. First, it provides a strong counterexample to the pervasive, cynical belief that people, governments, and corporations can never cooperate to solve global problems requiring foresight and self-discipline. Second, it illustrates concretely all three features required for overshoot: rapid growth, limits, and delayed response (in both science and politics).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 28 (location ~ 415-421)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Sustainability is a concept so foreign to our present growth-obsessed culture that we take some time in chapter 7 to define it and to outline what a sustainable world might be like-and what it need not be like. We see no reason why a sustainable world needs to leave anyone living in poverty. Quite the contrary, we think such a world would have to provide material security to all its people. We don’t think a sustainable society need be stagnant, boring, uniform, or rigid. It need not be, and probably could not be, centrally controlled or authoritarian. It could be a world that has the time, the resources, and the will to correct its mistakes, to innovate, to preserve the fertility of its planetary ecosystems. It could focus on mindfully increasing the quality of life rather than on mindlessly expanding material consumption and the physical capital stock. The concluding chapter 8 derives more from our mental models than from data or a computer model. It gives the results of our personal attempts to understand what must be done now. Our world model, World3, gives the basis both for pessimism and for optimism about the future. And on this issue, the authors diverge. Dennis and Jorgen have come to believe that a decline in the average quality of life is now inevitable, and probably even global population and economy will be forced to fall. Donella believed all her life that humanity will develop the insights, institutions, and ethics it needs to achieve an attractive, sustainable society. But even with our different views we all three agreed on how the challenge should be approached, and this is discussed in chapter 8.</em></p>

<p><em>Much that we wrote in The Limits to Growth 30 years ago remains true. But science and society have evolved over the past three decades. All of us have learned much and gained new perspectives. The data, the computer, and our own experience all tell us that the possible paths into the future have narrowed since we first addressed limits to growth in 1972. Levels of affluence we might have provided sustainably to all the globe’s people are no longer attainable; ecosystems we might have preserved have been extinguished; resources that might have given wealth to future generations have been consumed. But there are still many available choices, and they are crucial. Figure 1-4 illustrates the enormous range of possibilities we believe still exists. The figure was derived by superimposing the curves for human population and human welfare generated by the 9 relevant computer scenarios we present later in this book.’</em></p>

There may be abrupt collapse; it is also possible there may be a smooth transition to sustainability. But the possible futures do not include indefinite growth in physical throughput. That is not an option on a finite planet. The only real choices are to bring the throughputs that support human activities down to sustainable levels through human choice, human technology, and human organization, or to let nature force the decision through lack of food, energy, or materials, or through an increasingly unhealthy environment.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1972 we opened The Limits to Growth with a quotation from U Thant, who was then secretary-general of the United Nations: I do not wish to seem overdramatic, but I can only conclude from the information that is available to me as Secretary-General, that the Members of the United Nations have perhaps ten years left in which to subordinate their ancient quarrels and launch a global partnership to curb the arms race, to improve the human environment, to defuse the population explosion, and to supply the required momentum to development efforts. If such a global partnership is not forged within the next decade, then I very much fear that the problems I have mentioned will have reached such staggering proportions that they will be beyond our capacity to control.4 More than 30 years have passed, and the global partnership is still not in evidence. But there is growing consensus that humanity is immersed in problems beyond its control. And a great deal of data and many new studies support the secretary-general’s warning.</em></p>

Most scenarios show decline, but some reflect a society that achieves a stable population and high, sustainable human welfare. For example, U Thant’s concerns were echoed in a 1992 report, “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity” signed by more than 1,600 scientists, including 102 Nobel laureates, from 70 countries: Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course. Human activities inflict harsh and often irreversible damage on the environment and on critical resources.

<p><em>The vast difference between linear growth and exponential growth is illustrated by considering two ways to increase the sum of $100-you could put the money in a bank account to accumulate the interest, or you could put the money in a jar and add a fixed amount to it annually. If you put a single deposit of $100 in a bank that pays 7 percent interest per year, compounded annually, and let the interest income accumulate in the account, the invested money will grow exponentially. Every year there will be an addition to the money already there. The rate of the addition is constant at 7 percent per year, but the absolute amount of increase will grow This addition is $7 at the end of the first year. The second year’s interest will be 7 percent of $107, which is $7.49, bringing the total to $114.49 at the start of year three. One year later the interest will be $8.01, and the total will be $122.50. By the end of the 10th year the account will have grown to $196.72. If you put $100 in a jar and add $7 to the contents each year, the money will grow linearly. At the end of the first year the jar will also hold $107, the same as the bank account. At the end of the 10th year it will hold $170, less money than there is in the bank account, but not a whole lot less. Initially both saving strategies seem to generate quite similar results, but the explosive effect of sustained exponential accumulation eventually becomes apparent (figure 2-3). After the 20th year, the jar holds $240, while the bank account holds almost $400. By the end of the 30th year, linear growth in the jar will have produced $310 in savings. The bank account, with 7 percent annual interest, will stand at just over $761. So in 30 years, exponential growth at 7 percent per year produces more than two times as much as linear growth, even though both started with identical deposits. At the end of year 50, the bank account is 6.5 times bigger than the deposit in the jar-almost $2,500 more!</em></p>

<p><em>The unexpected consequences of exponential growth have fascinated people for centuries. A Persian legend tells about a clever courtier who presented a beautiful chessboard to his king and requested that the king give him in exchange one grain of rice for the first square on the board, two grains for the second square, four grains for the third, and so forth. The king agreed and ordered rice to be brought from his stores. The fourth square on the chessboard required 8 grains, the tenth square took 512 grains, the fifteenth required 16,384, and the twenty-first square gave the courtier more than a million grains of rice. By the forty-first square, a trillion (1012) rice grains had to be provided. The payment could never have continued to the sixty-fourth square; it would have taken more rice than there was in the whole world! A French riddle illustrates another aspect of exponential growththe apparent suddenness with which an exponentially growing quantity approaches a fixed limit. Suppose you own a pond. One day you notice that a single water lily is growing on your pond. You know that the lily plant will double in size each day. You realize that if the plant were allowed to grow unchecked, it would completely cover the pond in 30 days, choking off the other forms of life in the water. But initially the lily seems small, so you decide not to worry. You’ll deal with it when it covers half the pond. How much time have you given yourself to prevent the destruction of your pond? You have left yourself just one day! On the 29th day the pond is half covered. The next day-after one final doubling-the pond will be totally shaded. It initially seems reasonable to postpone action until the pond is half covered. On the 21st day, the plant covers just 0.2 percent of the pond. On the 25th, the plant covers just 3 percent of the pond. But again, that policy allows just one day to save your pond.2</em></p>
<ul>

<p><em>You could personally experience this sudden shift from insignificance to overload. Imagine eating one peanut on the first day of the month, two peanuts on the second day, four peanuts on the third, and so on. Initially you are buying and consuming an insignificant amount of food. But long before the end of the month, your bank account and your health would be severely affected. How long could you maintain this exercise in exponentially growing food intake, with a doubling time of one day? On the 10th day you would need to consume less than a pound of peanuts. But on the last day of the month, your policy of doubling consumption on each successive day would force you to buy and eat more than 500 tons of peanuts! The peanut experiment would not cause serious harm, because you would simply, one day, contemplate an impossibly large pile of peanuts and quit. In this example there are no significant delays between when you take an action and when you feel its full consequences. A quantity growing according to a pure exponential growth equation doubles in a constant time period. For the yeast colony, the doubling time was 10 minutes. Money in a bank earning 7 percent annual interest doubles about every 10 years. For the lily plant and the peanut experiment, the doubling times were each precisely one day. There is a simple relationship between the rate of growth in percentage terms and the time it will take a quantity to double. The doubling time is approximately equal to 72 divided by the growth rate in percent.’</em></p>

<p><em>In system dynamics the title positive loop does not necessarily mean that the loop produces favorable results. It simply refers to the reinforcing direction of the causal influence around the loop. Similarly, negative feedback loops, which we will discuss further in a moment, do not necessarily produce unfavorable results. In fact they’re often stabilizing. They are negative in the sense that they counteract or reverse or balance causal influence around the loop. A positive feedback loop can operate as a “virtuous circle,” or a “vicious circle,” depending on whether the growth it produces is wanted or not. Positive feedback causes the exponential growth of yeast in rising bread and of money in your interest-bearing bank account. Those are useful. Positive feedback may also be responsible for pest outbreaks in an agricultural crop or for growth of a cold virus in your throat. Those are not useful. Whenever a system stock is embedded in a positive feedback loop, that stock has the potential to grow exponentially. That doesn’t mean it will grow exponentially; it does, however, have the capacity to do so if it is freed from constraints. Growth can be constrained by many things, such as lack of nutrients (in the case of yeast), low temperature and the presence of other populations (in the case of pests), and, in the case of the human population, incentives, disincentives, goals, purposes, disasters, diseases, desires. The rate of growth will vary over time; it will differ from place to place. But yeast, pest, or population growth, when it is not limited by a constraint, occurs exponentially.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not an accident that the industrial world has come to expect an economy to grow by a certain percentage of itself-say, 3 percent each year. That expectation evolved out of several centuries of experience with capital creating more capital. It has become customary to save and invest for the future, to set aside a certain fraction of total output in the expectation that this will be invested to generate even more output in the future. An economy will grow exponentially whenever the self-reproduction of capital is unconstrained by consumer demand, labor availability, raw materials, energy, investment funds, or any of the other factors that can limit the growth of a complex industrial system. Like population, capital has the inherent system structure (a positive feedback loop) to produce the behavior of exponential growth. Economies don’t always grow, of course, any more than populations do. But they are structured to grow, and when they do, they grow exponentially. There are many other factors in our society that may have the capacity for exponential growth. Violence may be inherently exponential, and corruption seems to feed on itself. Climate change also involves a variety of positive feedback. For example, emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere lead to higher temperature, which in turn accelerates the melting of the Arctic tundra. As the tundra defrosts, it releases trapped methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that can boost global temperatures even higher. Some positive feedbacks are explicitly included in World3.</em></p>

<p><em>Population and productive capital are the motors of exponential growth in human society. Other entities, such as food production, resource use, and pollution, tend to increase exponentially-not because they multiply themselves, but because they are driven by population and capital. There is no selfgeneration, no positive feedback loop, to cause pesticides in groundwater to create more pesticides, nor coal to breed underground and create more coal. The physical and biological consequences of growing 6 tons of wheat per hectare do not make it easier to grow 12 tons per hectare. At some point-when limits are reached-each doubling of food grown or minerals extracted is not easier but more difficult than the doubling before. Therefore, insofar as food production and materials and energy use have been growing exponentially (which they have), they have been doing so not through their own structural capacity, but because the exponentially growing population and economy have been demanding more food and materials and energy and have been successful at producing them. Similarly, pollution and waste have been growing not because they have their own positive feedback structure, but because of the rising quantities of materials moved and energy used by the human economy.</em></p>

<p><em>World Population Growth In the year 1650 the human population numbered around half a billion. It was growing at about 0.3 percent per year, with a doubling time of nearly 240 years. By 1900 the population had reached 1.6 billion and was growing at 0.7 to 0.8 percent per year, a doubling time of about 100 years. By 1965 the population totaled 3.3 billion. The rate of growth had increased to 2 percent per year, a doubling time of about 36 years. Thus the population grew not only exponentially from 1650, but in fact superexpo- nentially-the rate of growth was itself growing. It was growing for a happy reason: Death rates were falling. Birth rates were also falling, but more slowly. Therefore the population surged. After 1965 death rates continued to fall, but birth rates on average fell even faster (figure 2-4). While the population rose from 3.3 billion to just over 6 billion by the year 2000, the rate of growth fell from 2 to 1.2 percent per year.6</em></p>

<p><em>That turnaround in population growth rate is an amazing shift, indicating major changes in the cultural factors that cause people to choose their family size and in the technical factors that enable them to carry out that choice effectively. The global average number of children born per woman went down from 5 in the 1950s to 2.7 in the 1990s. In Europe at the turn of the twenty-first century, completed family size averaged 1.4 children per couple, considerably less than the number required to replace the pop- ulation.6 The European population is projected to decline slowly, from 728 million in 1998 to 715 million in 2025.7 This fertility downturn does not mean that total world population growth has ceased, or ceased being exponential. It simply means that the doubling time has lengthened (from 36 years at 2 percent per year to 60 years at 1.2 percent per year) and may lengthen still farther. The net number of people added to the planet was in fact higher in 2000 than it was in 1965, though the growth rate was lower. Table 2-3 shows why: The lower rate in 2000 was multiplied by a larger population.</em></p>

<p><em>On the left is the positive loop that can produce exponential growth. The larger the population, the more births per year. On the right is a negative feed back loop. Whereas positive loops generate runaway growth, negative loops tend to regulate growth, to hold a system within some acceptable range, or to return it to a stable state in which the system stocks have more or less constant values over time. A negative feedback loop propagates the consequences of a change in one element around the circle until they come back to change that element in a direction opposite to the initial change.</em></p>

<p><em>The most widespread theory about how fertility and mortality change and why global population growth rates are falling-the theory that is built into the World3 model-is called the demographic transition. According to this theory, in pre-industrial societies both fertility and mortality are high, and population growth is slow As nutrition and health services improve, death rates fall. Birth rates lag by a generation or two, opening a gap between fertility and mortality that produces rapid population growth. Finally, as lives and lifestyles evolve into the patterns of a fully industrial society, birth rates fall, too, and the population growth rate slows. The actual demographic experiences of 6 countries are shown in figure 2-6. You can see that birth and death rates in long-industrialized countries such as Sweden fell very slowly. The gap between them was never very large; the population never grew at more than 2 percent per year. Over the entire demographic transition, the populations of most countries of the North grew by a factor of five at most. By the year 2000 few industrial nations had a fertility level above replacement, and thus most are facing declining populations in the years to come. Those that were still growing were doing so because of immigration, demographic momentum (more young people coming into reproductive age than older people leaving it), or both. In the South, where death rates fell later and faster, a large gap opened up between birth and death rates. This part of the world has experienced rates of population growth much greater than any the North ever had to deal with (except for North America, which absorbed high rates of immigration from Europe). The populations of many countries of the South have already grown by factors of 10 and are still growing. Their demographic transitions are far from complete.</em></p>

<p>*The factors believed to be most directly important in lowering birth rates are not so much the size or wealth of the economy, but the extent to which economic improvement actually touches the lives of all families, and especially the lives of women. More important predictors than GNI per capita are factors such as education and employment (especially for women), family planning, low infant mortality, and relatively egalitarian distribution of income and opportunity.9 China, Sri Lanka, Costa Rica, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, and several other countries have shown that when literacy, basic health care, and family planning are made available to most families, birth rates can drop even at modest income levels. The World3 model contains many countervailing pressures on birth rates. We assume that a wealthier economy provides better nutrition and health care, which bring down death rates, and that it also improves family planning and reduces infant mortality, which bring down birth rates. We assume that industrialization reduces desired family size, over the long term and after a delay, by raising the cost of bringing up children and reducing their immediate economic benefits for their parents. We assume that a short-term income increase allows families to afford more children, within the range of children they desire, and a short-term income stagnation does the opposite.’a</p>
