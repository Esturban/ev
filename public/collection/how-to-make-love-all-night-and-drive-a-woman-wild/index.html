<p><em>FACT: Male multiple orgasm is nothing new. Eastern cultures, for example, have been aware of male multiple orgasm and nonejaculatory orgasm (NEO) for many years, and it is not difficult to find references to it in their tantric literature and historical literature. High up on mountaintops in faraway lands, both men and women have been having a good old time for a long, long time. FACT: Male multiple orgasm is well documented in professional publications. Knowledge of this phenomenon has not been restricted to a handful of enlightened souls living on distant shores.</em></p>

<p><em>Although the professional community became more accepting of the concept, the standard belief was that “either you have it or you don’t.” In other words, men didn’t become multiorgasmic: either they were born that way or they weren’t born that way. And that was that. It wasn’t until the 1970s that professionals began to consider a third possibility: that male multiple orgasm could actually be learned. That’s when the real fun started. Ever since then, many open-minded sex therapists, myself and my colleagues included, have been working long and hard (no jokes please) to develop and refine a number of valid techniques that any man could learn. Though we all like to argue about whose methods are best, there is one thing we all agree on: it can be done.</em></p>
