<h1>How to Make Anyone Fall in Love With You (Leil Lowndes)</h1><p> Dec. 26, 2018</p>


<br/><br/>



<p><em>Image consultants are paid thousands of dollars to pontificate in boardrooms across America, “You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” The adage has been given the exalted status of a proverb: “First impressions are most lasting.” So what else is new? What’s new is this: Even as we enter the 21st century, we don’t really comprehend the unbelievable compass and consequence of first impressions. Or on what lilliputian details they are sometimes based. Gentlemen, one backward baseball cap or gold chain flashing through the hair on your chest can make or break a budding relationship with the lady before you even say “hi.” Ladies, one quarter of a turn away when he ventures “hello,” can turn the handsome prince back into a frightened frog.</em></p>

<p>*If first impressions are so crucial and a Potential Love Partner makes the “go/no go” decision within seconds of spotting you, here’s the big question: Why do people looking for love spend so much time making themselves attractive when they go out on a date but so little when they take the dog to the vet? By the time you have the date, your Quarry’s first impression of you has already been set. How you look on the date is, of course, important. But it’s not nearly as decisive as his or her first glimpse of you. You don’t realize it, but here’s the sad truth: You have probably let dozens of PLPS get away in recent months just because your trap wasn’t set</p>
