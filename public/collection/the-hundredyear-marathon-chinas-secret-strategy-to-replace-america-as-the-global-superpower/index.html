<p><em>The following day, as Cai was introduced, he was dressed in a Western-style suit, gray overcoat, and orange-red scarf. A trim, handsome man with graying hair, he looked out upon the Mall and the subject of his latest piece of performance art, a four-story-tall Christmas tree decorated with two thousand explosive devices. As Cai twisted a handheld trigger, his audience watched the tree explode before their eyes, with thick black smoke emerging from the branches. Cai twisted the trigger again, and the tree exploded a second time, then a third. The five-minute display sent pine needles across the vast lawn in all directions and dense black smoke—symbolizing China’s invention of gunpowder—billowing up the façade of the Smithsonian’s iconic red sandstone castle.2 It would take two months to clean up the debris and residue left by the explosion. I don’t know if any of the guests contemplated why they were watching a Chinese artist blow up a symbol of the Christian faith in the middle of the nation’s capital less than a month before Christmas. In that moment, I’m not sure that even I appreciated the subversion of the gesture; I clapped along with the rest of the audience. Perhaps sensing the potential controversy, a museum spokesman told the Washington Post, “The work itself is not necessarily about Christmas.”3 Indeed, the museum labeled Cai’s performance simply, “Explosive Event,” which, if one thinks about it, is not much more descriptive than what Cai called it on his own website: “Black Christmas Tree.”4 Secretary Clinton’s aide waved the gold medal for the press corps to see, as Cai smiled modestly. He had just been given the State Department’s Medal of Arts, the first of its kind, which was presented to the artist by Clinton herself, along with $250,000, courtesy of the American taxpayer. The medal was awarded, she said, for the artist’s “contributions to the advancement of understanding and diplomacy.”5 Cai seemed to agree with the sentiment: “All artists are like diplomats,” he said. “Sometimes art can do things that politics cannot.”</em></p>

<p><em>Cai, it turned out, has quite a large following inside China. He was and remains arguably the most popular artist in the country, with the notable exception of Ai Weiwei. Many of Cai’s fans were nationalists, and applauded him for blowing up Western symbols before a Western audience. China’s nationalists called themselves ying pai, meaning “hawks” or “eagles.” Many of these ying pai are generals and admirals and government hard-liners. Few Americans have ever met them. They are the Chinese officials and authors I know the best because since 1973 the U.S. government has instructed me to work with them. Some of my colleagues wrongly dismiss the ying pai as nuts. To me, they represent the real voice of China.7 Cai and the hawks appear to be very supportive of the narrative of the decline of the United States and the rise of a strong China. (By coincidence, his given name, Guo Qiang, means “strong country” in Mandarin.) Cai’s earlier exhibits featured variations on this theme. For instance, while American soldiers were coming under nearly constant assault by IEDs in Afghanistan and Iraq, the artist simulated a car bomb explosion to ask “his viewers to appreciate some kind of redeeming beauty in terrorist attacks and warfare.”8 The artist raised eyebrows when he said that the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, was a “spectacle” for the world audience, as if it were—in some twisted sense—a work of art. Shortly after the attacks, an Oxford University professor reported that Cai Guo Qiang proclaimed that his favorite book9 was Unrestricted Warfare: War and Strategy in the Globalization Era, a work of military analysis in which two Chinese colonels recommended that Beijing “use asymmetrical warfare, including terrorism, to attack the United States.”10 Even now, Chinese bloggers were enjoying the spectacle of their hero destroying a symbol of the Christian faith only a stone’s throw from the U.S. Capitol. The joke, it appeared, was very much on us.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 60-76)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>We Americans still don’t see China the way it sees us—a condition that has persisted for decades. Why else would the Smithsonian Institution and the State Department pay a famous Chinese artist $250,000 to blow up a Christmas tree on the National Mall? The answer lies, at least in part, in an ancient proverb that says, “Cross the sea in full view” or, in more practical terms, “Hide in plain sight.” It is one of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, an essay from ancient Chinese folklore.11 All of these stratagems are designed to defeat a more powerful opponent by using the opponent’s own strength against him, without his knowing he is even in a contest. Perhaps unwittingly, Cai alluded to this idea in remarks he delivered later to an audience at the State Department. “Everyone,” he said, “has their little tricks.”12 It is generally understood among those of us calling ourselves China experts that our life’s work is devoted to reducing misunderstandings between the United States and China. We have our work cut out for us. Americans have been wrong about China again and again, sometimes with profound consequences. In 1950, the Chinese leadership believed that it had given a clear warning to the United States that its troops should not come too close to the Chinese border during the Korean War, or China would be forced to respond in kind. No one in Washington got that message, and in November of that year Chinese troops surged across the Yalu River into North Korea, engaging U.S. troops in numerous battles before the war was halted by an armistice in 1953, after more than thirty thousand American soldiers had died. The United States also misunderstood China’s relationship with the Soviet Union, the reasons for its overtures to the Nixon administration in the 1970s, its intentions regarding student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989, its decision to treat an accidental U.S. bombing of a Chinese embassy in 1999 as an act that Chinese leaders equated with the atrocities of Hitler, and more. Many of us who study China have been taught to view the country as a helpless victim of Western imperialists—a notion that China’s leaders not only believe, but also actively encourage. When I was studying for my PhD at Columbia University in 1967, my political science professors emphasized how the West and Japan had mistreated China, with the implication that my generation needed somehow to atone for this. Many of our textbooks contained similar arguments.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>It even has influenced our translations. One of the first things a student of the Chinese language learns is its essential ambiguity. There is no alphabet, and Chinese words aren’t formed by letters. Rather, words are formed by combining smaller words. The word for size combines the character for large with the character for small. The word for length combines the words for short and long. Chinese use dictionaries to organize thousands of characters, which must be filed under approximately two hundred so-called radicals or families, all sorted according to relatedness. Under each category of relatedness, the dozens of characters are again sorted in order of the total number of strokes required to write a character, from a minimum of one to a maximum of seventeen strokes. Adding to this complexity are the tones and pitches that delineate words. The effect of tones is to give a single word four possible meanings. A classic example is ma. In the first tone, ma means mother. The second tone is a rising tone, so ma then means numb. The third tone for ma means horse, and the fourth tone for ma, which falls sharply, means to scold. The Chinese must talk loudly to make the tonal differences audible. Another ambiguity is how few sounds the Chinese language uses for syllables. The English language uses ten thousand different syllables, but Chinese has only four hundred. Thus, many words sound the same.</em></p>

<p><em>From thwarting reconstruction efforts and economic development in war-ravaged Afghanistan to offering lifelines to embattled anti-Western governments in Sudan and North Korea, China has opposed the actions and goals of the U.S. government. Indeed, China is building its own relationships with America’s allies and enemies that contradict any peaceful or productive intentions of Beijing. Take, for example, weapons of mass destruction. No security threat poses a greater danger to the United States and our allies than their proliferation. But China has been less than helpful—to put it mildly—in checking the nuclear ambitions of North Korea and Iran. In the aftermath of 9/11, some commentators expressed the belief that America and China would henceforth be united by the threat of terrorism, much as they had once been drawn together by the specter of the Soviet Union.</em></p>

See also David Shambaugh, China’s Communist Party: Atrophy and Adaptation (Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2008). Shambaugh writes that the “forces for change already exist [in China] and are only going to become more intense over time. This is as close to a ‘law’ of political development as exists—when a nation makes the transition from developing country to newly industrialized country, the pressures from society on the state to effectively govern arise. The ruling party-state has essentially only two options once this process begins: Stifle or suppress the demands, or open channels to accommodate the demands” (Italics in original.), p. 180.</em></p>

<p><em>18 A 2009 assessment by the European Council on Foreign Relations, a leading center-left think tank, describes as “anachronistic” the belief that contact with the European Union will cause China to “liberalize its economy, improve the rule of law and democratize its politics.”19 Rather than the emergence of an American-style free market economy, scholars are increasingly noting the emergence of a system termed “authoritarian capitalism.”20 Andrew Nathan of Columbia University, writing in Journal of Democracy, calls the transformation “authoritarian resilience.”21 Nonetheless, the idea that the seeds of democracy have been sown at the village level became the conventional wisdom among many China watchers in America. With patience but no pressure from the United States, the argument went, local elections in Chinese cities and towns would eventually be followed by regional and national elections.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>My faith was first shaken in 1997, when I was among those encouraged to visit China to witness the emergence of “democratic” elections in a village near the industrial town of Dongguan. While visiting, I had a chance to talk in Mandarin with the candidates and see how the elections actually worked. The unwritten rules of the game soon became clear: the candidates were allowed no public assemblies, no television ads, and no campaign posters. They were not allowed to criticize any policy implemented by the Communist Party, nor were they free to criticize their opponents on any issue. There would be no American-style debates over taxes or spending or the country’s future. The only thing a candidate could do was to compare his personal qualities to those of his opponent. Violations of these rules were treated as crimes. One candidate I spoke to asked me if this was how democratic elections worked in the West. I didn’t have the heart to tell him the truth. China’s hawks had already done away with true elections.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 167-174)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Many expressed the worrisome view that if the United States pressed China too hard to have elections, to free dissidents, to extend the rule of law, and to treat ethnic minorities fairly, then this pressure would lead to the collapse of the Chinese state—causing chaos throughout Asia. For decades, we have seen such arguments in op-ed pieces, news stories, and books that have dominated our national discourse about China. Yet the hard fact is that China’s already robust GDP is predicted to continue to grow by at least 7 or 8 percent, thereby surpassing that of the United States by 2018 at the earliest, according to economists from the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the United Nations.25 Unfortunately, China policy experts like me were so wedded to the idea of the “coming collapse of China”26 that few of us believed these forecasts. While we worried about China’s woes, its economy more than doubled.</em></p>

<p><em>In the 1940s, an effort was funded by the U.S. government to understand the Chinese mind-set. This culminated in several studies, including one in which 150 Chinese emigrants in New York’s Chinatown were shown Rorschach inkblot cards. The researchers, who included the scholars Nathan Leites, Ruth Benedict, and Margaret Mead, also analyzed the themes of popular Chinese books and films. One conclusion that emerged was that the Chinese did not view strategy the same way Americans did. Whereas Americans tended to favor direct action, those of Chinese ethnic origin were found to favor the indirect over the direct, ambiguity and deception over clarity and transparency. Another conclusion was that Chinese literature and writings on strategy prized deception.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 201-207)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Chinese literature on strategy from Sun Tzu through Mao Tse-tung has emphasized deception more than many military doctrines. Chinese deception is oriented mainly toward inducing the enemy to act inexpediently and less toward protecting the integrity of one’s own plans. In other cultures, particularly Western, deception is used primarily with the intention of ensuring that one’s own forces can realize their maximum striking potential … the prevalent payoff of deception for the Chinese is that one does not have to use one’s own forces.… Chinese tend to shroud their means in secrecy and not publicize the day-to-day activities of those in power; for surprise and deception are assumed to be vital.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 208-213)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>As I assembled clues contradicting the conventional narrative about China that I had always believed, I starting connecting the pieces of an alternative narrative of roughly the past four decades. Over time, I discovered proposals by Chinese hawks (ying pai) to the Chinese leadership to mislead and manipulate American policymakers to obtain intelligence and military, technological, and economic assistance. I learned that these hawks had been advising Chinese leaders, beginning with Mao Zedong, to avenge a century of humiliation and aspired to replace the United States as the economic, military, and political leader of the world by the year 2049 (the one hundredth anniversary of the Communist Revolution). This plan became known as “the Hundred-Year Marathon.” It is a plan that has been implemented by the Communist Party leadership from the beginning of its relationship with the United States. The goal is to avenge or “wipe clean” (xi xue) past foreign humiliations. Then China will set up a world order that will be fair to China, a world without American global supremacy, and revise the U.S.-dominated economic and geopolitical world order founded at Bretton Woods and San Francisco at the end of World War II. The hawks assess that China can only succeed in this project through deception, or at least by denial of any frightening plans.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 230-239)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Chinese have denied any desire to exercise global leadership—or to clash with the United States. Indeed, written into the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China is language that prohibits the nation from becoming a hegemon.31 Chinese leaders routinely reassure other nations that “China will never become a hegemon.”32 In other words, China will be the most powerful nation, but not dominate anyone or try to change anything. We don’t have a copy of the plan. Indeed, the Chinese say there is no plan. They merely want to restore China to its former global position of three hundred years ago, when it commanded roughly a third of the world economy. That apparently means becoming at least twice as strong as the United States by 2049, the hawks say.</em></p>

These notions of the more peaceful and less nationalist China have been confirmed by ideological allies in the West who populate academia, think tanks, financial institutions, and government. Advancing the notion of a China that is more interested in economic growth than global dominion serves to advance their self-interest, whether it be a private equity fund manager making investments in Chinese companies or a think tank scholar whose funding, access, and ability to facilitate studies and conferences with her Chinese counterparts depends on advancing the rosy scenario. This predominant school of thought among our foreign policy experts, economists, and businessmen is well meaning and not without evidence. There exist in China moderates and those who genuinely seek cooperation with the United States. Indeed, Chinese government officials usually echo those views and are eager to promote them as the authentic voice of China.</em></p>

<p><em>For the past three decades, as a China expert who has worked in the Congress and in the executive branch for every administration since Richard Nixon’s, I have arguably had more access to China’s military and intelligence establishment than any other Westerner. Representatives from the People’s Liberation Army and the Ministry of State Security have opened the doors to their most secretive institutions and given me documents and writings that no other Westerner has read. The hard-liners among them saw me as a useful tool to promote their views, even if I caused discomfort among those in Beijing and Washington who were invested in the image of a peaceful, docile China. In 1998 and 2000, I published two academic books called Chinese Views of Future Warfare35 and China Debates the Future Security Environment,36 which translated many of the documents I had collected on my visits to Beijing or that had been given to me by Chinese military leaders and defectors.</em></p>

The generals and foreign policy experts I quoted in my two books expressed gratitude that their views had been translated accurately and were receiving some attention, at least among a small clique of national security experts in Washington, and proceeded to grant me more access in the years following.</em></p>

<p><em>What is indisputable, even for those who continue to advocate for closer ties between the United States and China, is that not only has China’s rise happened right under our noses, but also the United States, and the West more broadly, have helped the Chinese accomplish their goals from the beginning. One key source of such assistance was the World Bank. Meeting with Chairman Deng Xiaoping in 1983, World Bank executives secretly agreed that a team of economists would study China intensively and, looking ahead twenty years, recommended how China could catch up to the United States.</em></p>

<p><em>On the edge of Beijing’s Tiananmen Square stands a ten-story obelisk, built on Mao’s orders in 1949. Official tour guides, licensed and monitored by China’s government, tend not to take foreigners to it. Even if Westerners do find their way there, they likely won’t understand what it depicts, since the site does not offer English translations of the Chinese characters etched in marble and granite. And yet the obelisk spells out the thinking that has governed the Marathon from the beginning. The mammoth object is described online, rather generically, as a “Monument to the People’s Heroes.”1 What the monument actually signifies is the airing of China’s grievances, which are perceived to be the products of a “century of humiliation” at the hands of Western powers, beginning in 1839 with the First Opium War, when the Royal Navy laid waste to Chinese ports over a trade dispute with the Qing dynasty. The text and carved images on the monument describe the subsequent one hundred years of Chinese history—at least as the Communist government sees it—as a time of popular resistance, Western occupation, and guerrilla warfare that culminated in the triumphant ascension of Chairman Mao Zedong in 1949 to end China’s humiliations by the West. American tourists walk by the obelisk every day, often taking pictures from a distance, and yet remain oblivious to the message it conveys—a message directed at them. That the obelisk has become a centerpiece for patriotic demonstrations among the Chinese people sends another signal that we have also missed: China’s day of justice is coming. In short, the obelisk is a perfect symbol of the relationship between China and the United States—the former nursing grievances, the latter completely in the dark.</em></p>

<p><em>The theme was adopted again in 1949. Mao’s writings were filled with Darwinian ideas. One of the two translators who most inspired Mao concluded that only two races, the yellow and the white, formed the future struggle in which the whites “had the upper hand” unless the yellow could change its strategy. Even before they discovered the writings of Karl Marx, Mao and his comrades believed that China’s survival would depend on a long-term, radical strategy that highlighted the unique traits of the Chinese people.8 Chinese Communist strategic thought came to be dominated by the idea of struggle for survival in a harshly competitive world. During Mao’s famous Long March—in which his Red Army sought to evade capture by the ruling government in the 1930s—he brought only one book with him, a statecraft manual with lessons from history that have no Western counterpart. The most important component of the book, translated into English as The General Mirror for the Aid of Government, centers on stratagems of the Warring States period in China and includes stories and maxims dating as far back as 4000 BC.9 One in particular, attributed to Confucius, fit nicely with the Darwinian concepts of which the Chinese had become enamored: “There cannot be two suns in the sky.”10 The nature of world order is hierarchy. There is always one ruler at the top. One of the biggest mistakes made by American experts on China was not taking this book seriously. It was never translated into English. Only in 1992 did we learn from Harrison Salisbury, a New York Times reporter, that not only did Mao love this book’s lessons in 1935, but also that he read it over and over until his death in 1976.11 Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders read it, too. Chinese high school students even learn to write from a textbook of selections from The General Mirror that includes many of the same lessons from the Warring States era about how to use deception, how to avoid encirclement by opponents, and how a rising power</em></p>

<p><em>The theme was adopted again in 1949. Mao’s writings were filled with Darwinian ideas. One of the two translators who most inspired Mao concluded that only two races, the yellow and the white, formed the future struggle in which the whites “had the upper hand” unless the yellow could change its strategy. Even before they discovered the writings of Karl Marx, Mao and his comrades believed that China’s survival would depend on a long-term, radical strategy that highlighted the unique traits of the Chinese people.8 Chinese Communist strategic thought came to be dominated by the idea of struggle for survival in a harshly competitive world. During Mao’s famous Long March—in which his Red Army sought to evade capture by the ruling government in the 1930s—he brought only one book with him, a statecraft manual with lessons from history that have no Western counterpart. The most important component of the book, translated into English as The General Mirror for the Aid of Government, centers on stratagems of the Warring States period in China and includes stories and maxims dating as far back as 4000 BC.9 One in particular, attributed to Confucius, fit nicely with the Darwinian concepts of which the Chinese had become enamored: “There cannot be two suns in the sky.”10 The nature of world order is hierarchy. There is always one ruler at the top. One of the biggest mistakes made by American experts on China was not taking this book seriously. It was never translated into English. Only in 1992 did we learn from Harrison Salisbury, a New York Times reporter, that not only did Mao love this book’s lessons in 1935, but also that he read it over and over until his death in 1976.11 Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders read it, too. Chinese high school students even learn to write from a textbook of selections from The General Mirror that includes many of the same lessons from the Warring States era about how to use deception, how to avoid encirclement by opponents, and how a rising power should induce complacency in the old hegemon until the right moment. We missed all this.</em></p>

<p><em>Chairman Mao’s bizarre nationalist schemes were sources of amusement to the West: he withdrew all of China’s ambassadors from overseas. To help farmers, Mao ordered the military to kill all the sparrows that were eating the crops. Yet the Great Leader did not seem to appreciate that the sparrows also kept harmful insects away. As a result, China’s crops suffered from widespread infestation. U.S. intelligence officials had trouble believing the reports that China was not satisfied being the junior partner to the Soviet Union. Americans considered the idea laughable that such a supposedly backward nation might one day rival the Soviet Union, much less the United States. But there was one group of people who weren’t laughing—the leaders of the Soviet Union. They saw what China was up to long before the Americans did. The first clues about the Marathon came from Moscow.</em></p>

The single-minded focus of my American colleagues was on how we might use Beijing as a wedge against Moscow.

I learned that from 1960 until 1962, thousands of pages of classified Soviet documents had been secretly photographed with a Minox camera in a series of operations that the CIA called IRON BARK. Incredibly, the documents revealed that Moscow’s military leaders already saw China as a military threat as dangerous as the NATO alliance. I also learned that the FBI in New York had been running three espionage operations, code-named SOLO, TOP HAT, and FEDORA, that had demonstrated very reliable and high-level access to the inner workings of the Soviet Politburo.20 But the FBI and the CIA wanted me to amplify this intelligence by asking questions that came from Kissinger and his advisers.</em></p>

<p><em>I remember one particular meeting with Shevchenko over coffee in the North Delegates Lounge of the UN headquarters building. I laughed perhaps too loudly at Shevchenko’s revealing joke about China’s future. In the joke, the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev calls President Nixon on the telephone. “The KGB tells me you have a new supercomputer that can predict events in the year 2000,” Brezhnev says. “Yes,” Nixon replies. “We have such a computer.” “Well, Mr. President, could you tell me what the names of our Politburo members will be then?” There is a long silence on Nixon’s end of the line. “Ha ha!” Brezhnev exclaims to Nixon. “Your computer is not so sophisticated after all.” “No, Mr. General Secretary,” Nixon replies, “it answers your questions, but I can’t read it.” “Why not?” Brezhnev demands. “Because it is in Chinese.” The joke was funny because it was so absurd. The idea that the future could belong to a Marxist backwater that couldn’t even feed its people seemed ridiculous.</em></p>

<p><em>I spent most of my time with Kutovoy, who worked in an office down the hall from me in the Political Affairs Division.21 Petrovski, our boss, would go on to become a Soviet deputy foreign minister. Kutovoy would become the Soviet ambassador to Yugoslavia. Like Shevchenko, they seemed to enjoy answering my questions. Both were then in their thirties. They even jovially tutored and lectured me about the history of Sino-Soviet conflict and the deviousness of the Chinese. Kutovoy told me that the Soviet Union had essentially built the modern Communist Chinese state, with Soviet advisers placed in every key government bureau. Weapons transfers, military training, and technical advice had all been provided in an attempt to modernize the Soviets’ Chinese ally. But in 1953, upon the death of Joseph Stalin, the relationship had begun to sour. Kutovoy said that Soviet leaders now believed that the Chinese had secret dreams of surpassing the Soviet Union, and that they would not just stop there—their next target would be the Americans. China wouldn’t play second fiddle. China would follow its own playbook, and that meant doing everything possible to become the dominant actor on the global stage.</em></p>

<p><em>The main Soviet message was that the Chinese were guided by their own historical ambition to restore their position atop the global hierarchy of nations. He and his colleagues told me that lessons learned from Chinese history advised the Chinese to become the most powerful nation and to conceal their intentions until the opportune moment. He warned me that the worst error the United States could make would be to provide military aid to China. He gave me two books by Russian scholars on ancient Chinese history to illustrate his points. A CIA report in 1971 quoted some of my findings, such as my conclusion that the Soviets anticipated that President Nixon would open ties with China and that they would not overreact to purely diplomatic contacts.22 By 1973, Moscow directly warned Nixon that the Soviet Union would use force if the United States went beyond pure diplomacy and actually formed a military relationship with China. Kissinger’s team would debate this option, and I argued in favor of direct aid in a memo that Kissinger implemented in great secrecy.</em></p>

<p><em>The Chinese planned to use the Americans as they had used the Soviets—as tools for their own advancement, all the while pledging cooperation against a third rival power. This was how the Marathon was conducted throughout most of the Cold War—China using the Soviet Union’s rivalry with America to extract Soviet aid and then, when that faltered, shifting to the Americans by offering to help against the Soviets. In doing so, the Chinese were reflecting another ancient stratagem—“kill with a borrowed sword”25—or, in other words, attack using the strength of another.</em></p>

<p><em>Four decades later, shortly after Xi Jinping assumed office as general secretary of the Communist Party of China (a precursor to his becoming president), he provided a greater glimpse of China’s underlying intentions. In his maiden speech in his new role, Xi used a phrase that no Chinese leader had ever used in a public speech, qiang zhongguo meng, or “strong nation dream.”26 The comment was remarkable. China’s leaders are extremely careful with their language, especially in public, far more so than Western politicians. They avoid words such as “dream” or “hopes” in their public remarks. Such emotion-laden sentiments are considered a flaky, Western eccentricity. However, Xi has since made repeated references to the “China dream” in his speeches. According to a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal, Xi referred to 2049 as the date the dream will be realized—one hundred years after Mao Zedong’s ascension in China and the formation of the Communist state.27 Xi’s reference was neither casual nor inadvertent. A veteran of the People’s Liberation Army and a former secretary to the defense minister, Xi is closely connected to the nationalist “super hawks” in the Chinese military. As I discovered from my own conversations with some native Chinese speakers in Xi’s audience, those educated in the country’s universities and members of the military understood Xi’s reference to the “strong nation dream” immediately. By invoking the “strong nation dream,” President Xi was referring to a once-obscure book—obscure, that is, in the West—published in China in 2009 called The China Dream. The book was written by a colonel in the People’s Liberation Army named Liu Mingfu, then working as a leading scholar at China’s National Defense University, which trains future generals of the People’s Liberation Army. It was there that I first spotted a specific written reference to “the Hundred-Year Marathon.”</em></p>

<p><em>Liu’s book called for a world-class military to project China’s global leadership. “China’s grand goal in the 21st century is to become the world’s No. 1 power,” Liu declared.30 “The competition between China and the United States,” he predicted, “will not be like a ‘shooting duel’ or a ‘boxing match’ but more like a ‘track and field’ competition. It will be like a protracted ‘Marathon.’” At the end of the Marathon, Liu contended, the ruler finally will be the most virtuous power on the planet—the Chinese.31 When asked in 2010 by an ABC News reporter about his provocative work, Liu held firm on the book’s central positions, but stressed that China’s competition and ultimate victory over the West would be peaceful. But for those of us able to read his book in the original Mandarin, that is not the tone he adopts there. The colonel alludes to the importance of studying American weaknesses, and preparing to hit the Americans once the West becomes wise to China’s true game plan.32 Liu also hints at the existence of an official Marathon strategy among the Chinese leadership, praising Mao Zedong because “he dared to craft a grand plan to surpass America, stating that beating the United States would be China’s greatest contribution to humanity.”33 As the Wall Street Journal revealed in 2013, The China Dream is featured in the “recommended reading” section of all state-controlled bookstores.34</em></p>

<p><em>Zhao Tingyang’s The Under-Heaven System: The Philosophy of the World Institution was published in 2005 and is gaining increasing currency in mainline Chinese thought today. Zhao’s “system” redesigns global structures based on traditional Chinese ideals. That new world is called tianxia,35 which in Mandarin can be translated as “under-heaven,” “empire,” and “China.” The China scholar William A. Callahan translates tianxia as a unified global system with China’s “superior” civilization at the top.36 Other civilizations, such as the United States, are part of the “barbarian wilderness.” As the center of the civilized world, China would have the responsibility to “improve” all the nations and peoples of the world by “harmonizing” them—spreading Chinese values, language, and culture so they can better fit into under-heaven. This empire “values order over freedom, ethics over law, and elite governance over democracy and human rights.”37 I met Zhao Tingyang in Beijing in July 2012, after he had achieved international acclaim. I asked him how the tianxia system would handle disobedience, in case any nations refused to follow the Chinese script. “Easy question,” he replied. “The Rites of Zhou prescribed a four-to-one military superiority to enable the emperor to enforce the All-Under-Heaven system.” In other words, after China wins the economic Marathon and develops an economy twice as large as America’s, China’s new status may have to be protected through military force. The world’s largest economy will need a force more powerful than any other—one that would eventually render American military might obsolete. America itself had done this between 1860 and 1940. China hawks not only studied American strategy, but also drew lessons from China’s ancient past, reaching back many centuries. The warnings the Soviet diplomats at the United Nations had provided in 1969 about Beijing’s deceptive tactics and long-term global ambition were now coming true.</em></p>

When the document containing this phrase leaked, Beijing translated it as the cryptic and generic “bide your time, build your capabilities.”4 But in its proper context, the proverb actually alludes to overturning the old hegemon and exacting revenge, but only once the rising power has developed the ability to do so. Many experts in America did not at first believe these references because they conflicted with their preconception that evidence of China’s aggressive strategic intentions must be discarded if it emanates only from the mouths and pens of the nationalist ying pai hawks in China, who were widely assumed to be fringe elements.</em></p>

Were it translated, more Americans might better understand Chinese leaders and their intentions when they speak in ways inspired by lessons from that turbulent period in China’s history. Students are taught lessons of the Warring States period, most of which derive from the Stratagems, which is considered a manual for statecraft. China’s modern military scholars and political philosophers hark back to this time in Chinese history more than any other. A committee of twenty-one Chinese generals has sponsored the publication of a nine-book series titled Strategic Lessons from China’s Ancient Past, which draws on the Warring States period.

<p><em>The nine principal elements of Chinese strategy, which form the basis of the Hundred-Year Marathon, include the following: 1. Induce complacency to avoid alerting your opponent. Chinese strategy holds that a powerful adversary, such as the United States today, should never be provoked prematurely. Instead, one’s true intentions should be completely guarded until the ideal moment to strike arrives. 2. Manipulate your opponent’s advisers. Chinese strategy emphasizes turning the opponent’s house in on itself by winning over influential advisers surrounding the opponent’s leadership apparatus. Such efforts have long been a hallmark of China’s relations with the United States. 3. Be patient—for decades, or longer—to achieve victory. During the Warring States period, decisive victories were never achieved quickly. Victory was sometimes achieved only after many decades of careful, calculated waiting. Today, China’s leaders are more than happy to play the waiting game. 4. Steal your opponent’s ideas and technology for strategic purposes. Hardly hindered by Western-style legal prohibitions and constitutional principles, China clearly endorses theft for strategic gain. Such theft provides a relatively easy, cost-effective means by which a weaker state can usurp power from a more powerful one. 5. Military might is not the critical factor for winning a long-term competition. This partly explains why China has not devoted more resources to developing larger, more powerful military forces. Rather than relying on a brute accumulation of strength, Chinese strategy advocates targeting an enemy’s weak points and biding one’s time. 6. Recognize that the hegemon will take extreme, even reckless action to retain its dominant position. The rise and fall of hegemons was perhaps the defining feature of the Warring States period. Chinese strategy holds that a hegemon—the United States, in today’s context—will not go quietly into the night as its power declines relative to others. Further, Chinese strategy holds that a hegemon will inevitably seek to eliminate all actual and potential challengers. 7. Never lose sight of shi. The concept of shi will be discussed in greater detail below. For now, suffice it to say that two elements of shi are critical components of Chinese strategy: deceiving others into doing your bidding for you, and waiting for the point of maximum opportunity to strike. 8. Establish and employ metrics for measuring your status relative to other potential challengers. Chinese strategy places a high premium on assessing China’s relative power, during peacetime and in the event of war, across a plethora of dimensions beyond just military considerations. The United States, by contrast, has never attempted to do this. 9. Always be vigilant to avoid being encircled or deceived by others. In what could be characterized as a deeply ingrained sense of paranoia, China’s leaders believe that because all other potential rivals are out to deceive them, China must respond with its own duplicity. In the brutal Warring States period, the naïve, trusting leader was not just unsuccessful in battle; he was utterly destroyed. Perhaps the greatest Chinese strategic fear is that of being encircled. In the ancient Chinese board game of wei qi, it is imperative to avoid being encircled by your opponent—something that can be accomplished only by simultaneously deceiving your opponent and avoiding being deceived by him.</em></p>

<p><em>Many of the most significant elements of China’s Marathon strategy were developed by members of the military, especially the ying pai hawks. Owing to pre-Communist Chinese civil-military traditions dating to about 1920, high-ranking Chinese military personnel are expected to play a significant role in civilian strategic planning. To get a sense of just how different this is from the American system, imagine that issues that are generally considered to properly fall under the purview of U.S. civilian leaders, such as family planning, taxation, and economic policy, were instead transferred to generals and admirals in the Pentagon. Imagine further that the United States lacked both a supreme court and an independent judiciary, and you get some sense of this tremendous disparity between the relatively narrow influence of our military leaders and the broader advisory role played by China’s top military leaders since 1949. Modern China’s first foreign minister was a general. We now know, from Henry Kissinger’s memoirs, that the decision to pursue an opening with the United States came not from China’s civilian leaders, but instead from a committee of four Chinese generals.6 In 1979, a Chinese weapons designer developed China’s one-child policy. In 1980, metrics for measuring China’s progress in pursuing its Marathon strategy were developed by a military writer from the Academy of Military Sciences, the premier research institute of the People’s Liberation Army. One of the best-known books in China about grand strategy, fittingly titled On Grand Strategy, was written by an author from the Academy of Military Sciences.7 A Chinese general developed China’s strategy for managing its energy resources. China’s long-term military science and technology plan was developed in 1986 by a team of nationalist hawkish Chinese nuclear weapons scientists.8 In June 1970, I, like other China experts in the U.S. government, knew none of this. That month, I was selected from a list of American PhD candidates for Mandarin-language training at Taiwan National University, which was to become my first foray into experiencing Chinese culture and history.</em></p>

<p><em>The ying pai hawks today speak of an allegory about America and China. One of the most famous stories from the Warring States period begins with a tale of two neighboring kingdoms, one rising, one falling in relative power: Chu and Zhou. As the leader of Chu reviewed his troops with a member of the declining Zhou dynasty along their mutual border, he couldn’t resist asking the size and weight of the cauldrons in the Zhou royal palace. The purpose of the meeting was for the rising leader of Chu to pledge fealty and forswear any imperial designs, but when Chu asked the weight of the emperor’s cauldrons, the perceptive Zhou representative chided him. “Each time a dynasty loses the mandate of heaven, the cauldrons are moved,” was the reply. “The king of Zhou has the cauldrons. His ancestor hoped to rule for thirty generations, or seven hundred years, with the mandate of heaven. Although the virtue of Zhou has declined, heaven’s mandate has not yet changed. It is too soon to ask about the weight of the cauldrons.”9 By asking about the cauldrons, Chu had inadvertently revealed his intent to challenge Zhou. The lesson is famous in China: “Never ask the weight of the emperor’s cauldrons.” In other words, don’t let the enemy know you’re a rival, until it is too late for him to stop you. On the international level, if you are a rising power, you must manipulate the perceptions of the dominant world power to not be destroyed by it. To ask the size and weight of the cauldrons was a strategic blunder by the king of Chu.</em></p>

<p><em>As chronicled in Stratagems of the Warring States, some of the wisest rising challengers even persuaded the old emperor to unwittingly assist in the challenger’s ascendance. In those cases, the challenger often persuaded the emperor to punish advisers who were skeptical of the challenger’s intentions (“hawks”) and to promote advisers whom the challenger could manipulate into complacency and cooperation (“doves”). The natural world order, the Stratagems explains, is hierarchical; systems without a ruler at the top are merely transitional. That world order is, of course, inconsistent with the official line from Beijing today. China’s leaders claim to want a multipolar world in which the United States will be first among equals. Put differently, they do not want to ask the weight of the emperor’s cauldrons. In truth, however, they see a multipolar world as merely a strategic waypoint en route to a new global hierarchy in which China is alone at the top. The Chinese term for this new order is da tong, often mistranslated by Western scholars as “commonwealth” or “an era of harmony.” However, da tong is better translated as “an era of unipolar dominance.” Since 2005, Chinese leaders have spoken at the United Nations and other public forums of their supposed vision of this kind of harmonious world. An important element of China’s grand strategy is derived from what is known in the West as mercantilist trade behavior—a system of high tariffs, gaining direct control of natural resources, and protection of domestic manufacturing, all designed to build up a nation’s monetary reserves. The Chinese invented mercantilism (zhong-shang), and the country’s leaders reject the West’s contention that mercantilism has been rendered obsolete by the success of free markets and free trade.</em></p>

<p><em>Another lesson from the Warring States period is that success requires extreme patience. American businesses live by quarterly reports, U.S. politicians operate on short election cycles, and successful stock market strategies may be based on trading conducted in a single day. Yet the stories of the Warring States period’s rising challengers teach that victory is never achieved in a single day, week, or year—or even in a decade. Only long-term plans spanning hundreds of years led to victory. Consequently, it’s not uncommon for today’s Chinese leaders, who automatically serve two ten-year terms, to make plans that span generations and to set goals that will not be achieved for a half century or more. Warring States literature and other folklore stories of Chinese cultural heroes have also stressed the importance of stealing ideas and technology from the opponent. Today, Chinese intelligence services routinely steal technology and competitive information, which they provide directly to Chinese corporate leaders.11 Many American officials assume that China’s predatory economic behavior in recent years—such as conducting industrial espionage or violating intellectual property rights—is part of a passing phase. To the contrary, it is one part of a much larger strategy inspired by stratagems distilled from the Warring States period.</em></p>

<p><em>Consider also the contrast between American and Chinese views about the optimum size of military forces. Many of America’s greatest military triumphs were achieved through large armies. Grant overwhelmed Lee with more men and more guns. On June 6, 1944, Dwight Eisenhower sent the largest armada in history to Normandy. Even in recent times, the so-called Powell Doctrine has advocated the necessity of a force far larger than the enemy’s. In contrast, the Warring States period did not involve great military outlays. Nonviolent competition for several decades constituted the main form of struggle. A famous strategy was to deplete an adversary’s financial resources by tricking it into spending too much on its military. Two thousand years later, when the Soviet Union collapsed, the Chinese interpretation was that the Americans had intentionally bankrupted Moscow by tricking it into spending excessively on defense. As of 2011, while the United States spent nearly 5 percent of its GDP on its military, the Chinese spent only 2.5 percent of theirs.12 The Chinese strategy has been to forswear development of global power projection forces and to maintain a curiously small arsenal of nuclear warheads, perhaps numbering fewer than three hundred. Instead of trying to match America plane for plane and ship for ship, China has invested heavily in asymmetric systems designed to get the biggest bang for the buck. The Chinese have pioneered antisatellite technology, developed the means to counter stealth bombers, invested heavily in cyber intrusion, and built missiles costing a few million dollars that can sink a $4 billion American aircraft carrier.13 The missile price was so low—and the capability so high—because the missile may have been based on stolen American technology.</em></p>

<p><em>At the heart of Chinese strategy is shi, which is a difficult concept to explain to a Western audience. It cannot be directly translated into English, but Chinese linguists describe it as “the alignment of forces” or “propensity of things to happen,” which only a skilled strategist can exploit to ensure victory over a superior force. Similarly, only a sophisticated adversary can recognize how he is vulnerable to the exploitation of shi.17 It is exactly the lack of recognition of the potential exploitation of shi that is dooming American strategy toward China. A close approximation to shi in American popular culture is “the force” from George Lucas’s Star Wars, which draws heavily on Eastern philosophy. Though not a perfect analogy, shi suggests that mystical forces allow the alert leader to identify and harness opportunities to turn events to his will.</em></p>

<p><em>As Sun Tzu described it in his chapter on shi in The Art of War, “those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform.”18 A simple way to think of shi is to recall how Tom Sawyer tricked his friends into painting the fence for him. He studied their psychologies, realized what motivated them, and then manipulated them into doing his work for him. A significant component or feature of shi is called wu wei, which means to get other nations to do your work for you. The very idea of shi gets to the heart of a distinctly Chinese view of the world, because it conveys an almost mystical fatalism about the role of human actors in the universe. Humans and nations can interact with each other and change events, but those events have an independent momentum all their own. Shi appears in compound vocabulary terms that mean “to shape a situation,” “to build up military posture,” “to assess the overall strategic political situation,” or “to seek a balance of power.” It is the duty of “the sage”—the rough equivalent of a modern-day statesman or intelligence professional—to perceive shi before the opponent does.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>They told me that the concept of shi is heavily influenced by Taoism, a religion and philosophy whose adherents desire to live in harmony with the driving force—the Tao—behind everything in the universe. Just as Taoists believe the universe is in a constant state of reinventing itself—a belief embodied by the yin-yang symbol—both shi’s strength and its polarity can be suddenly reversed. Chinese military authors frequently refer to how shi can tip in one direction or another, or even reverse itself instantly. This puts a premium on the early detection of shifts, and the need for monitoring indicators that would show when such a change is under way. Ames and Jullien said that shi has dozens of translations, such as “shaping” the situation, or “eventuating.” Other translators call shi the creation of opportunity, or creation of momentum. “Unfolding” or “nudging” are also English words approximating the concept. Shi has many applications. It is used to measure the quality of Chinese calligraphy, assess the appeal of Chinese literary works, and evaluate the aesthetics of Chinese poetry. Jullien and Ames also told me that shi is an example of what philosophers call “incommensurability.” A set of concepts may be too different to understand when considered outside the context of its own language. Mao was fond of citing shi. His classic essay on Chinese strategy, which invokes shi, is still required reading in both military and civilian Party schools. Chinese writings after 1978 demonstrate that some strategists believe Chinese leaders failed to read shi correctly during the 1950s and ’60s vis-à-vis China’s relations with the Soviet Union. Because the Soviets discovered that China sought to usurp the USSR’s leadership of the Communist world, China failed to extract further foreign investment, trade opportunities, military technology, or political support from the Soviet Union. Stung by their failure to master shi in their relations with the Soviets, the Chinese after 1978 vowed not to repeat the mistake as they developed their new strategy toward the United States.</em></p>

<p><em>Shi—and Chinese grand strategy—partly entail encircling an enemy by building up one’s own coalition while simultaneously undermining the opponent’s coalition to prevent him from encircling you. The unique Chinese word for strategist, which comes from the Warring States period, means a “horizontal-vertical expert”—a reference to the two main alliances during the Warring States era. The “horizontal” alliance of states, which consisted of states laid out east to west on a map, decided to join with the dominant power, Qin, to reap the benefits of protection and association. The opposing “vertical” alliance, consisting of the many states running from north to south, joined together to oppose the rising Qin state. These two coalitions struggled for decades to erode each other by winning over allies with carrots and sticks. Finally, the horizontal alliance soothed its rivals by denying any ambition to replace them and appealing to their short-term interests. Deception successfully broke apart the opposing coalition, and Qin, its strongest member, conquered the vertical alliance.</em></p>

<p><em>Shi is crucial to understanding how Chinese strategists assess the balance of power in a given situation and then act in accordance with how the shi is flowing. An important part of their assessment relies on the kinds of quantitative metrics planners pioneered during the period of the Warring States. One of the striking features of Chinese assessments of shi is that the term is used both as a concept of measurement that analysts must examine and also as something that can be created and manipulated by the actions of the commander or national leaders. There is a misleading popular image of ancient Chinese culture that focuses on the sayings of Confucius, poetry, calligraphy, and Chinese art. The impression given is that the ancients were more creative and philosophical than they were analytical and mathematical. Yet the RAND Corporation scholar Herbert Goldhammer has pointed out that during the Warring States period, some strategists could supposedly convince their opponents to concede just by showing them quantitative calculations dooming the opponents to defeat.26 Quantitative measurements played a vital role in ancient Chinese politics, and they continue to do so today.</em></p>

<p><em>In the final deception, the two greatest deception masters in Chinese history conclude their struggle. Zhuge Liang had anticipated Cao Cao’s thought process, and therefore had placed his troops not on the main road, but on the trail under the smoke. The many ambushes along the now arduous trail leave the northern commander with only three hundred men, but he still manages another escape. He believes he is safe, and once again laughs at Zhuge Liang’s supposed stupidity. However, once again he marches into an ambush, resulting in his final defeat. The long series of deceptions destroy Cao Cao, who had commanded the largest military force in China. He is bested by the machinations and deceptions of a smarter, almost superhuman sage—one who detects windows of opportunity and disguises his intentions. “A single deception can cause a vast defeat.” This belief is echoed in much of the commentary on the Battle of Red Cliff authored by China’s nationalist military hawks today. <em>   </em>   </em> Numerous authors comment that the techniques employed by Zhuge Liang in the Battle of Red Cliff were combined in a brilliant sequence: assessing propensity, practicing deception, employing special forces for decisive attack, manipulating high-level dissent, and forming a strategic coalition while isolating the opponent.31 Conversely, Cao Cao failed to apply the lessons, causing him to lose the conflict he had begun. Two prominent Chinese military authors emphasize that the victors at Red Cliff applied the strategy of “wait and see” until propensity was favorable.32 Another adds that espionage helps define propensity—the moment when the enemy destroys itself by internal friction and begins to decline, thereby providing the ideal opportunity to attack.33*</p>

<p><em>A forty-year employee of the CIA, Larry Wu-Tai Chin, was accused in 1985 of engaging in decades of espionage on behalf of China. Chin was accused of providing countless classified U.S. documents regarding China to the Chinese government, charges to which Chin pled guilty in 1986. While confessing to a judge, Chin declared that he acted as he did to promote reconciliation between the United States and China. Shortly thereafter, he was found by a guard asphyxiated in his prison cell. Larry Chin seemed to admit to the judge he revealed our planning and weaknesses to the Chinese government so Beijing could have been highly effective in getting all it wanted.1 America, in contrast, has not had similarly placed informants to provide direct insight into Chinese strategic thinking. Because we also lack access to internal Chinese policy documents, this chapter attempts to unearth the motivations of China’s leaders during the time of renewed relations with the United States through the end of the Reagan administration by examining U.S. accounts of what appeared to be driving China, as well as other open-source information that has emerged since. Unlike the United States, China has not released, nor is it likely to ever release, official internal records showing how Chinese leaders were able to obtain essentially all of the major economic, military, and diplomatic-political assistance it sought from the last eight U.S. presidents, from Richard Nixon through Barack Obama. However, there do appear to be consistent strategic approaches followed by Beijing that have been acknowledged in general terms in interviews of and articles by Chinese scholars. The nine elements of Chinese strategy (introduced in chapter 2) help us to better make sense of China’s past and prospective actions. The use of deception, shi, patience, and avoiding encirclement by the Soviet Union are all apparent.</em></p>

<p><em>Many Americans discounted the influence of China’s hawks. They were surprised to learn that the military secretly designed China’s opening to America. In the spring of 1969, Mao summoned four hawkish army marshals who wanted to end China’s decade of passivity and instead to stand up to the threat of the Soviet Union—Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and Ye Jianying.2 These marshals summed up the American strategy toward the Soviet Union and China in a Chinese proverb of “sitting on top of the mountain to watch a fight between two tigers.”3 In other words, they believed America was waiting for one Communist country to devour the other, and they thought in terms of ancient lessons from the Warring States period. In May 1969, Mao asked them for further recommendations. According to Kissinger, the marshals’ private secretary recorded that the group discussed “whether, from a strategic perspective, China should play the American card in case of a large-scale Soviet attack on China.”4 Marshal Chen Yi suggested that the group study the example of Stalin’s nonaggression pact with Hitler in 1939. Another marshal, Ye Jianying, cited the “Red Cliff strategy” pursued by Zhuge Liang, the southern commandeer who outwitted Cao Cao: “We can consult the example of Zhuge Liang’s strategic guiding principle, when the three states of Wei, Shu, and Wu confronted each other: ‘Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.’”5 In the marshals’ view, America feared a Soviet conquest of China: “The last thing the U.S. imperialists are willing to see is a victory by the Soviet revisionists in a Sino-Soviet war, as this would [allow the Soviets] to build up a big empire more powerful than the American empire in resources and manpower.”</em></p>

<p><em>Chen Yi pointed out that the new president, Richard Nixon, seemed eager “to win over China.” He proposed what he called “wild ideas” to elevate the United States–China dialogue to the ministerial level, or even higher.7 Most revolutionary, according to Kissinger, was Chen Yi’s proposal that the People’s Republic drop its long-held precondition that Taiwan be returned to mainland China.8 Chen Yi argued: First, when the meetings in Warsaw [the ambassadorial talks] are resumed, we may take the initiative in proposing to hold Sino-American talks at the ministerial or even higher levels, so that basic and related problems in Sino-American relations can be solved.… Second, a Sino-American meeting at higher levels holds strategic significance. We should not raise any prerequisite.… The Taiwan question can be gradually solved by talks at higher levels. Furthermore, we may discuss with the Americans other questions of strategic significance.9 <em>   </em>   </em> China still called the United States its enemy, describing a possible visit by Nixon as an instance of China “utilizing contradictions, dividing up enemies, and enhancing ourselves.”10 In other words, the United States was merely a useful tool for China, not a long-term ally. Operating on this principle, Beijing sent a secret message to Nixon and Kissinger: since President Nixon had already visited Belgrade and Bucharest—capitals of other Communist countries—he would also be welcome in Beijing.11 The message contained no hint of trust or future cooperation.*</p>

<p><em>In 1969, Mao was able to assess correctly the shi that was driving China out of the Soviet orbit and toward a new alliance with the West. Mao had taken two actions to accelerate this shift. The first was his invitation of Nixon to Beijing. The second was to test two massive hydrogen bombs without warning within days of each other near the Soviet border. The act served both as a show of force and as a signal to America that China sought to move away from the Soviet orbit. Realizing the Americans still weren’t quite getting the message, Mao did something on October 1, 1970, quite unusual for the committed and anti-Western Communist: he invited the well-known American journalist and author Edgar Snow to stand with him on the Tiananmen reviewing stage, and arranged for a photograph of both of them to be taken for all of China to see. Mao gave his guest a message: President Nixon was welcome to visit China. This was an astonishing invitation—the latest of several overtures by the Chinese government. Kissinger admits that Washington still did not get the message, or at the very least did not appreciate its sincerity. The U.S. government was too preoccupied with its own interests and strategies to care about China’s. Thus the history of normalized Sino-American relations started off with a myth. Nixon did not first reach out to China; instead, China, in the person of Mao, first reached out to Nixon. The Americans just didn’t realize it. Nor did Washington yet know that Chinese documents called America the enemy and likened it to Hitler.</em></p>

<p><em>Security Council staffers, John Holdridge and Helmut Sonnenfeldt, wrote memos that seemed to favor an overture, with neither fearing a Soviet overreaction.12 But two others, Roger Morris and Bill Hyland, were opposed.13 Morris and Hyland feared that any U.S.-China alliance would needlessly provoke Moscow and severely damage the administration’s emerging policy of détente with the Soviet Union. Four senior American ambassadors had already met in person with Nixon to warn him that Moscow would respond to any U.S. opening to China by halting movement toward détente and arms control. These clashing memos help to explain why Nixon and Kissinger delayed the opening to China by two years. They had to be prodded by China, and by my own reports from the Soviets at the United Nations that Moscow would not call off détente and actually expected America to accept China’s deceptive offers of an alignment. Shevchenko and Kutovoy had said exactly this to me. My evidence seemed to play a modest role in breaking this deadlock. I relayed what I had gathered so far: that the Sino-Soviet split was in fact genuine and that the Soviets expected us to open relations with the Chinese. I reported, and others verified, that senior diplomats such as Arkady Shevchenko already assumed that Nixon would improve relations with China to some degree. Their fear was only that he would go “too far” and establish military ties—something that was not then on the table. I was a strong—and, I hoped, persuasive—advocate for a Sino-American alliance. Kissinger even sent me a thank-you note later.</em></p>

<p><em>Another factor was China’s involvement in the Vietnam War. Beginning in the 1950s, China had been supplying North Vietnam with weapons, supplies, and military advice. China had recently reduced military aid to North Vietnam and had even drastically reduced Soviet shipments through China, which further persuaded the Nixon administration to side with the pro-China camp. The Americans would receive reassurance on this front during Nixon’s visit to Beijing when Mao told the president that he was eager to remove any threat from China to the United States: At the present time, the question of aggression from the United States or aggression from China is relatively small; that is, it could be said that this is not a major issue, because the present situation is one in which a state of war does not exist between our two countries. You want to withdraw some of your troops back on your soil; ours do not go abroad.16 Kissinger asserts that this sentence indicating that Chinese troops would not go abroad reduced the U.S. concern that China would intervene in Vietnam, as it had done in Korea in 1950.17 Mao correctly recognized that this fear featured prominently in American thinking and wanted to induce complacency.</em></p>

<p><em>“America is the ba,” Zhou told Kissinger’s interpreter, Ambassador Ji Zhaozhu of China’s Foreign Ministry, repeating a term that would be frequently used by Chairman Mao and his successor, Deng Xiaoping. U.S. government officials who understand Mandarin—a small but growing group—have long known that many Chinese and English terms cannot be fully translated between the two languages. Choices must often be made by the interpreters about what each side really means. Kissinger’s translator told Kissinger that Zhou’s statement meant, “America is the leader.” This seemed to be an innocuous remark, and when taken in the context of the Cold War even a compliment. But that is not what the word ba means in Mandarin—at least that is not its full context. Ba has a specific historical meaning from China’s Warring States period, where the ba provided military order to the known world and used force to wipe out its rivals, until the ba itself was brought down by force. The ba is more accurately translated as “tyrant.” In the Warring States period, there were at least five different ba. They rose and fell, as each new national challenger outfoxed the old ba in a contest of wits lasting decades or even a hundred years. One wonders how U.S. policy toward China might have shifted had Kissinger been told that day that the Chinese saw Americans not as leaders, but as wrongdoers and tyrants. To this day we still have to sort out and live with the consequences of that key mistranslation.</em></p>

<p><em>Two months after Zhou’s conversation with Kissinger, with Nixon’s visit just around the corner, Kissinger made the first of many covert offers to the Chinese. Unbeknownst to a public that would have been shocked to see the United States aiding and abetting the People’s Liberation Army, Kissinger gave China detailed classified information about Indian troop movements against Pakistan,23 as well as America’s “approval of Chinese support for Pakistan, including diversionary troop movements.”24 In return, Kissinger asked for Chinese troop movements on the Indian border to distract India from its efforts to invade and then dismember eastern Pakistan.

What the Americans missed was that it was not a permanent Chinese policy preference, but only expedient cooperation among two Warring States.

<p><em>The next covert offer—the fourth since Nixon’s first meeting with Mao and the sixth since Kissinger’s first trip to China—promised to offer China any deal America offered to the Soviet Union. In the run-up to the summit meeting between Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in June 1973, Kissinger reaffirmed that “anything we are prepared to do with the Soviet Union, we are prepared to do with the People’s Republic.”39 In fact, the United States was willing to offer China deals even better than those made with the Soviets: “We may be prepared,” said Kissinger, “to do things with the People’s Republic that we are not prepared to do with the Soviet Union.”40 At about this time, Nixon sent a note stating “in no case will the United States participate in a joint move together with the Soviet Union under [the Prevention of Nuclear War] agreement with respect to conflicts … where the PRC is a party.”41 At the same time, he decided to circumvent U.S. law and regulations by providing technology to China through the British.42 The seventh covert offer was the most sensitive one, and would not be revealed for three decades, even to the CIA. It grew out of an internal debate I witnessed in October 1973 about whether to back up America’s vague promises to Beijing and do something tangible to strengthen China, or to stay at the level of mere words and gestures. The United States could establish a “more concrete security understanding” with the Chinese, or instead merely promise significant progress in the diplomatic normalization of bilateral relations.43 There was a strong case for each option.</em></p>

<p><em>I shared Iklé’s support for tangible U.S. covert cooperation with China. Though Iklé told Kissinger that a “formal relationship” (that is, a formal alliance) was not desirable, Washington could unilaterally provide help of a “technical nature.” The United States could set up a “hotline” arrangement that would provide a cover for Washington to give Beijing secret early-warning information about Soviet military actions directed against China. “Given that a large portion of the Chinese strategic forces will continue to consist of bombers, hours of advance warning could be used by them to reduce the vulnerability of their forces significantly,” Iklé and I wrote in one memo. “The fact that the hotline might enable us to transmit warning of a possible Soviet attack could be a powerful argument.” We also advocated Washington’s selling to Beijing hardware and technology to alert the Chinese if the Soviets were about to attack, and we supported providing America’s superior high-resolution satellite images to heighten the accuracy of Chinese targeting of Soviet sites.44 Kissinger agreed with our proposal. Only a few knew that he proposed tangible U.S. covert cooperation with China. On a trip to Beijing in November 1973, Kissinger told the Chinese that in the event of a Soviet attack the United States could supply “equipment and other services.”</em></p>

<p><em>Sino-American relations went through their biggest improvement in the late 1970s, as Deng Xiaoping took on increasing power and became the public face for China’s PR offensive with the United States. To Westerners, Deng was the ideal Chinese leader: a moderate, reform-minded man with a tranquil, grandfatherly demeanor. He was, in short, the kind of figure Westerners wanted to see. But Deng was no docile grandfather. In private meetings within the Politburo, he raged at aides and advisers over China’s lack of progress against the West. He believed that under Mao and his questionable “reform” practices, China had lost thirty years in its campaign to surpass the American ba. Deng was enthusiastic about a partnership with the Americans, but for a key reason not meant for public consumption. He had rightly deduced that by following the Soviet economic model, China had backed the wrong horse and was now paying the price. Internal Chinese documents, which came into the hands of U.S. intelligence officials long after the fact, showed that Chinese leaders concluded that they had failed to extract all they could from their now-faltering Soviet alliance. Deng would not make the same mistake with the Americans. He saw that the real way for China to make progress in the Marathon was to obtain knowledge and skills from the United States. In other words, China would come from behind and win the Marathon by stealthily drawing most of its energy from the complacent American front-runner. Within the Politburo, Deng was known for referencing a favorite admonition from the Warring States, tao guang yang hui (hide your ambitions and build your capability). Deng, too, sent opponents messages through seemingly oblique and harmless stories. During his first meeting with President Gerald Ford in December 1975, he referred to a story from the classic Chinese book The Romance of the Three Kingdoms to make what in retrospect was an important point, one completely lost on Ford. The story again involves Cao Cao, discussed in the previous chapter, considered in Chinese literature to be one of history’s greatest tyrants. Cao Cao, in fact, probably best exemplifies the concept of a ba in ancient Chinese literature. In the particular vignette Deng told Ford, Cao Cao defeats Liu Bei, a rival challenger, and remains the ba. After their war, the challenger offers to work for Cao Cao, but Cao Cao remains suspicious of Liu Bei’s loyalty. Deng cited to President Ford Cao Cao’s famous quote “Liu Bei is like an eagle, which when it is hungry will work for you, but when it is well fed, will fly away.” Ostensibly, the “eagle” in Deng’s story was the Soviet Union. American attempts to accommodate the Soviets, Deng warned, would fail. Once they had what they wanted, the Soviets, like Liu Bei, would pursue their own interests. What the Americans missed from that anecdote was that the same strategic sentiment held true for China. Once America built China into an equal, China would not remain an ally but would “fly away.”</em></p>

<p><em>One of Cao Cao’s servants pointed to a cloud formation that resembled a dragon. All eyes turned to the dragonlike formation, and Cao Cao asked his guest if he understood the evolution of dragons. “Not in detail,” Liu Bei replied. “A dragon can assume any size, can rise in glory, or hide from sight,” Cao Cao said. “This is the midspring season, and the dragon chooses this moment for its transformations like a person realizing his own desires and overrunning the world. The dragon among animals compares with the hero among people. You, General, have traveled all lakes and rivers. You must know who are the heroes of the present day, and I wish you would say who they are.” Liu Bei feigned puzzlement. “I am just a common dullard. How can I know such things?” “You may not have looked upon their faces, but you must have heard their names,” Cao Cao responded. “Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai, with his strong army and abundant resources: Is he one?” Liu Bei asked. Cao Cao laughed. “A rotting skeleton in a graveyard. I shall put him out of the way shortly.” “Well, Yuan Shao then,” Liu Bei offered. “A bully, but a coward.” “There is Liu Biao of Jingzhou.” “He is a mere semblance, a man of vain reputation,” Cao Cao answered. “No, not he.” “Sun Ce is a sturdy sort, the chief of all in the South Land. Is he a hero?” Liu Bei inquired. “He has profited by the reputation of his father, Sun Jian. Sun Ce is not a real hero.” “What of Liu Zhang of Yizhou?” “Though he is of the reigning family, he is nothing more than a watchdog.” Finally Liu Bei asked, “What about Zhang Xiu, Zhang Lu, Han Sui, and all those leaders?” “Paltry people like them are not worth mentioning,” retorted Cao Cao. “With these exceptions I really know none,” Liu Bei said at last. “Now, heroes are the ones who cherish lofty designs in their bosoms and have plans to achieve them. They have all-embracing schemes, and the whole world is at their mercy.” “Who is such a person?” asked Liu Bei. Cao Cao pointed his finger at Liu Bei and then at himself, and said, “The only heroes in the world are you and I” (italics mine). Liu Bei gasped, dropping his chopsticks to the floor. Just then, loud thunder roared from the clouds. Liu Bei, bending over to retrieve his chopsticks, exclaimed, “What a shock! And it [referring to the thunder] was quite close.” Surprised, Cao Cao said, “What! Are you afraid of thunder?” After all, what hero is afraid of mere thunder? Liu Bei had succeeded in concealing his true ambitions to challenge the ba. A short time later, Liu Bei recounted his experience to two close allies, noting that his goal “was to convince Cao Cao of my perfect simplicity and the absence of any ambition. But when he suddenly pointed to me as one of the heroes, I was startled, for I thought he had some suspicions. Happily the thunder at that moment supplied the excuse I wanted.” “Really you are very clever,” they said. The rest—quite literally—is history. Liu Bei soon gained his independence from Cao Cao and spent the rest of his long life fighting against him for dominance.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1975, while still at RAND, I wrote an article for Foreign Policy magazine advocating military ties between the United States and China, to create a wedge against the Soviets. Richard Holbrooke, the once and future diplomat, was then serving as the magazine’s editor. He was a strong proponent of the article, labeling my idea a “blockbuster.” He shared my thoughts with other editors, leading to a long story in Newsweek, “Guns for Peking?” Other media outlets picked up the proposal, while the Soviet press attacked both the arguments I made in the proposal and me personally.49 Chinese military officers at the United Nations had suggested the idea to me. So in 1973 I began four decades of conversations with China’s military hawks, hearing about lessons from Warring States to deal with the hegemon, which I then assumed would always mean the Soviet Union. In early 1976, Ronald Reagan, running against President Ford for the Republican presidential nomination, read the article. (I had sent it to Reagan at Holbrooke’s behest.) In a handwritten note, the former California governor said he agreed with the idea of closer ties with the Chinese as a wedge against the Soviets. But he also cautioned me about the Chinese, and worried in particular about abandoning America’s democratic allies in Taiwan. After I met with Governor Reagan at his Pacific Palisades home—where he joked about being “sixty-four years old and unemployed”—he encouraged me to keep sending him material about China that he might use in speeches.</em></p>

<p><em>In January 1979, Deng made his first and only visit to the United States, and he was a hit. President Carter feted him at a state dinner and, in a sign of the bipartisan flavor of U.S.-China policy, even invited the disgraced Richard Nixon to attend, the first time the former president had visited the White House since his resignation in August 1974. Deng spent thirteen days in the United States, touring Coca-Cola’s headquarters, the Johnson Space Center in Houston, and even Disney World. In a sign of acceptance by the American popular media, Time magazine put Deng on its cover, twice. At the National Museum in Beijing, one can see displayed a photograph of Deng smiling beneath a ten-gallon hat he received in Texas, which became the symbol of his 1979 visit. It signaled to the U.S. public that he was good-humored, less like one of “those Communists” and more like “us.” But it also proved a turning point for the Chinese and the Marathon. Deng obtained far more than had Mao. On January 31, 1979, during his visit to the United States, Deng and Fang Yi, director of the State Science and Technology Commission, signed agreements with the U.S. government to speed up scientific exchanges. That year, the first fifty Chinese students flew to America. In the first five years of exchanges, some nineteen thousand Chinese students would study at American universities, mainly in the physical sciences, health sciences, and engineering, and their numbers would continue to increase.52 Carter and Deng also signed agreements on consular offices, trade, science, and technology—with the United States providing all sorts of scientific and technical knowledge to Chinese scientists in what would amount to the greatest outpouring of American scientific and technological expertise in history.</em></p>

President Carter provided China with intelligence support to aid China’s war in Vietnam, to a degree that shocked even Henry Kissinger, as he described in his 2011 book On China. In tones suggesting that perhaps he’d created a monster by opening the door to ties with Beijing, Kissinger denounced Carter’s “informal collusion” with what was “tantamount to overt military aggression” by Beijing—aid that “had the practical effect of indirectly assisting the remnants of the Khmer Rouge.”53 A visit to China by Secretary of Defense Harold Brown, Kissinger fumed, “marked a further step toward Sino-American cooperation unimaginable only a few years earlier.” The ninth offer, Presidential Directive 43, signed in 1978, established numerous programs to transfer American scientific and technological developments to China in the fields of education, energy, agriculture, space, geosciences, commerce, and public health.54 The following year, the Carter administration granted China most-favored-nation status as a U.S. trading partner.</em></p>

President Carter also authorized the establishment of signals intelligence collection sites in northwestern China in about 1979, as the CIA operative and future U.S. ambassador to China James Lilley described in his memoir, China Hands. “Part of the reason I was awarded a medal from the CIA was my work setting up the first CIA unit in Beijing,” Lilley wrote. “Another contributing fact was my role in developing intelligence sharing with China.… It sounded like a far-fetched idea—the United States and China, who had been fighting each other through surrogates just a few years earlier in Vietnam, working together to collect strategic technical intelligence on the Soviet Union.”55</em></p>

<p><em>In the tenth offer, U.S.-Chinese intelligence gathering along China’s border with the Soviet Union—code-named the Chestnut program—was approved, according to the New York Times reporter Patrick Tyler. Later, during an August 1979 trip to China by Carter’s vice president, Walter Mondale, the Pentagon and the CIA airlifted to China the Chestnut monitoring stations via military transport. Tellingly, Tyler reported, the Chinese asked the U.S. Air Force C-141 Starlifter at the Beijing airport to park beside a Soviet passenger jet so the Soviets would see the cooperation.60 According to Tyler, these monitoring stations could collect information about air traffic, radar signals from Soviet air defenses, and KGB communications, and they could also detect any change in the alert status of Soviet nuclear forces.61 Thus China would have an increase in its warning time in the event of a Soviet attack. This was a huge advance in Chinese security in the months before the attempted encirclement that would begin with the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. Through their patience, the Chinese were getting more than what Kissinger, Iklé, and I had proposed six years earlier. According to the requirements of shi, Beijing must have thought it needed America’s help to break up the two “pincers” of the Soviet encirclement of China—in Afghanistan and Vietnam. The circumstances justified going farther than Mao had; Deng would accept significant aid from the hegemon.62</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Starting in the summer of 1984, two years after the program in Cambodia began, Chinese covert cooperation to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan would become fifty times larger than its effort in Cambodia. We did not understand shi and counterencirclement at that time, and therefore no one thought the Chinese government would risk Soviet wrath by becoming a major arms supplier to America’s efforts to aid the Afghan rebels. The discovery was made by a brilliant, Mandarin-speaking CIA friend, Joe DeTrani.65 This Chinese connection was a tightly held secret, and no more than ten people in the entire CIA were aware of the program, according to Tyler. The Chinese still do not acknowledge that they provided such arms. In his book Charlie Wilson’s War, George Crile reports that the first order was for AK-47 assault rifles, machine guns, rocket-propelled antitank grenades, and land mines.66 In 1984, Representative Charlie Wilson had drummed up $50 million to increase support for the rebels in Afghanistan. Crile reports that the CIA decided to spend $38 million of it to buy weapons from the Chinese government. The Washington Post in 1990 quoted anonymous sources that said that the total value of weapons provided by China exceeded $2 billion during the six years of Sino-American covert cooperation. U.S.-Chinese clandestine cooperation reached its peak during the Reagan administration. Presidents Nixon and Ford had offered China intelligence about the Soviets. President Carter established the Chestnut eavesdropping project. But it was Reagan who treated China as a full strategic partner—albeit in secret.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Two decades later, the journalist Steve Coll alleged that “the Chinese communists cleared huge profit margins on weapons they sold in deals negotiated by the CIA.”68 If the assertion is accurate that $2 billion was spent on Chinese weapons for the anti-Soviet rebel groups, then China’s purchase of more than $500 million in American military equipment for itself seems relatively small. The Chinese not only sold the weapons to us to give to the rebels, but also advised us how to conduct these covert operations. From their advice emerged a few lessons about Chinese strategy toward a declining hegemon, in this case the Soviet Union. First, the Chinese emphasized that we had to identify key Soviet vulnerabilities to exploit. One tactic, they explained, was to raise the cost of empire. When I first proposed the option of supplying Stinger antiaircraft missiles to the Afghan and Angolan rebels, the Chinese were delighted at the high costs that these weapons would impose, in the form of destroyed Soviet helicopters and jet fighters. The second idea was to persuade others to do the fighting. This was of course a manifestation of the Warring States–era notion of wu wei. The third concept was to attack the allies of the declining hegemon. The Cambodian rebels worked against the Soviets’ Vietnamese puppets. The Angolan rebels expelled the Cubans, who had been flown to Angola in Soviet aircraft that might also have been shot down with Stingers, if they had been made available then. The United States, in cooperation with China, did all this, and more.</em></p>

<p><em>In 1985, the aid to the Chinese Marathon expanded to include American weapons, as the Reagan administration arranged for the sale of six major weapons systems to China for more than $1 billion. This program aimed to strengthen China’s army, navy, and air force and even to help China expand its marine corps.71 And in March 1986 the Reagan administration assisted China’s development of eight national research centers focused on genetic engineering, intelligent robotics, artificial intelligence, automation, biotechnology, lasers, supercomputers, space technology, and manned spaceflight.72 Before long, the Chinese had made significant progress on more than ten thousand projects, all heavily dependent on Western assistance and all crucial to China’s Marathon strategy. The Reagan administration hoped it was countering Soviet power by giving a boost to the Chinese, and everyone—from Reagan on down—wanted to believe Beijing’s claims that China was moving toward greater liberalization.</em></p>

<p><em>Colonel Larry Wortzel, seemed to think that the students’ demonstration was significant. Ultimately, he went out on a limb in predicting that the Chinese army would be used to clear the square. Wortzel, like me, had had many contacts with the hawks for years. He paid attention to them. He later told me that the hawks were the source of his insight that force would be used, a rare example that showed that the hawks sometimes knew the minds of the leaders better than did the moderates. Many of us worried that the students might embarrass the real reformers inside the Communist Party. Most everyone thought, as many still stubbornly do today, that China was on the inevitable path to reform. True, we had been told that a few heroes at the top of the Chinese government were pushing too fast for major reforms. But it was inconceivable to us that within a year they would all be imprisoned or placed under house arrest, or would defect or be exiled. We knew there was a debate within the Politburo over reforms, but we lacked any details as to who wanted what, or how strong the enemies of reform might be. Few facts challenged this complacent attitude, though they were there if we chose to see them. One small surprise had come only weeks earlier, when fifty thousand students marched in a Beijing memorial service for Hu Yaobang, the former head of the Communist Party, deposed by Deng Xiaoping for what the press was told was Hu’s “mercurial” personality.4</em></p>

<p><em>Flashing back to 1968, during my days on the Columbia University “strike committee” against the Vietnam War, I exchanged war demonstration stories with a young Chinese professor, who was wearing aviator glasses and chain smoking. His name was Liu Xiaobo, of Beijing Normal University. Liu had just flown back from New York a day earlier to be with the students in the square.5 Liu had been a visiting scholar at Columbia and wanted to be part of history. He would not really enter history until he was arrested for signing the Charter 08 twenty years later, when he was sentenced to yet another prison term. He subsequently received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. His recent writings include direct attacks on hypernationalism and military hawks, which he seems to take seriously. At that time in 1989, the mainstream view in China and the West was that the hawks would not prevail and that force would never be used against the students. In May, Deng Xiaoping declared martial law and rushed 250,000 troops into the Chinese capital. When the protesters refused to disperse, Deng sent in his tanks and soldiers. Hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of unarmed Chinese students died in the streets, many killed by bullets designed to expand upon impact. Whole buildings surrounding the square were raked with gunfire. Soldiers kicked and clubbed protesters and tank treads rolled over their legs and backs. A lone man stood in the path of a row of tanks in an iconic image of the massacre. He was pulled away by a group of people—never to be heard from again.</em></p>

<p><em>After Tiananmen, many of China’s reformers were condemned to spend the rest of their lives under house arrest, while some senior intellectuals from Party think tanks managed to flee to the West. Government censorship increased—with a particular emphasis on purging all references to the protest from Chinese news and history books. Within a year of the massacre, the Chinese government “had closed 12 percent of all newspapers, 13 percent of social science periodicals, and 76 percent of China’s 534 publishing companies,” according to the political scientist Minxin Pei.6 It also seized 32 million books, banned 150 films, and punished 80,000 people for media-related activities.7 Despite these horrific events, changes to existing U.S. policy toward China came slowly. President Bush worked hard to undermine congressional efforts to recall Tomsen’s successor, Ambassador James Lilley, or to alter the U.S.-China relationship in any meaningful way.8 Instead he followed the advice of his old boss Richard Nixon, who counseled, as Bush noted in his diary, “Don’t disrupt the relationship. What’s happened has been handled badly and is deplorable, but take a look at the long haul.” According to Bush, Nixon didn’t “think we should stop our trade [or do] something symbolic, because we must have a good relationship in the long run.”9 At one point, Bush described the students gathering at Tiananmen as “just a handful of all those demonstrators.”10</em></p>

No one could know yet that the Tiananmen incident led to the collapse of the liberalizing trends of Chinese governance, as Deng aligned with the conservatives and named one of them prime minister. Yet in the aftermath of the incident, Deng began utilizing anti-U.S. rhetoric taken directly from the “spiritual pollution” nationalist ideologues.13 He strengthened the role of hard-liners such as Li Peng, Hu Qiaomu, and Deng Liqun, and began a systematic purge of reform-minded members of the People’s Liberation Army and Politburo. To the shock of many Americans, Zhao Ziyang, China’s reform-minded party leader, was placed under house arrest for the rest of his life. Twenty years would pass before Andrew Nathan of Columbia University mysteriously acquired and published The Tiananmen Papers, which showed how Zhao had struggled in vain for real reform against the hawks, facing overwhelming odds that were unknown to us at the time.14</em></p>

<p><em>No one I worked with at the CIA or the Pentagon in the 1980s raised the idea that China could deceive the United States or be the cause of a major intelligence failure. Instead, all the sources and defectors were essentially saying the same thing: China was en route to a free-market economy, elections, and ever greater cooperation. But after Tiananmen, Chinese defectors came to the United States in increasing numbers, warning of what was to come and sounding a different, more ominous tone about their homeland’s future. Yet even then we refused to listen. One defector stood out in particular, at least in my mind. For a high-level defector, his demands were unusually modest—political asylum; a new name; a house; a decent-paying job; and, of course, a cover story that would convince Chinese intelligence that he was dead. Defectors always make demands, usually for significant sums of money. They also routinely claim they know more important secrets than others do. But this man, plump and twitchy, was different—not only because he asked for relatively little, but also because what he told us ran completely counter to our conventional wisdom and challenged many long-standing U.S. policies.</em></p>

He identified a number of Chinese secret documents that we already had obtained, sorting out fakes from real ones with a breezy confidence. He passed a polygraph examination. The only problem we had with him was the new intelligence he offered. We didn’t believe it. Mr. White revealed that for three years, from 1986 to 1989, there had been a power struggle in the Politburo over China’s strategy for the future. Claiming to have read from notes of secret high-level meetings and debates, he told us of the power of the hawks, and their sweeping effort to crush pro-American sentiment in the country; that the Tiananmen Square crisis had rocked China’s internal stability; and that Deng Xiaoping was now siding with these hard-liners. He knew the roles of specific hawks and how they overwhelmed the moderates. Yet he thought that we should somehow help the real reformers. I was heartened by how much he presumed we knew about internal Chinese politics, and his hope that we could save the reformers. Deng, the defector revealed, had even more audacious plans for spreading the hawks’ views of Chinese nationalism. Mr. White had attended secret meetings focusing on how to revive Confucius as a national hero, after decades of Communist Party attacks on Confucian culture and anything hinting at religion more generally. Of course, it was nothing new for China’s leaders to order, in Orwellian terms, that the country’s history be rewritten. After the Communist Party seized power in 1949, teams of Chinese historians recast China’s history to emphasize that all progress had come from peasant rebellions, what the historian James Harrison had termed “the most massive attempt at ideological reeducation in human history.”16 But this latest change, as Mr. White was characterizing it, was so sweeping that it defied credulity. The Communist Party, which for all of its existence had claimed to have been a break from China’s past, would now embrace it? Communist ideology was being quietly discarded in favor of a hypernationalism as a means for the government’s survival? Red China, in effect, was no longer quite so red? It all seemed—quite literally—unbelievable.</em></p>

<p><em>I arranged to see Mr. White shortly after that meeting. It wasn’t that I necessarily believed what he was saying, but it did stoke my curiosity. We spoke in Mandarin. If this seemingly absurd idea of dropping Marxism from the national ideology and national school curriculum contained an ounce of truth, I wondered, how would it be carried out? Mr. White replied that he had heard of plans to set up an innocuous-sounding “patriotic education” curriculum. There would be one hundred “patriotic education” bases across the country, new historical monuments, and new museums for national tourism. China’s leaders planned to fund TV and radio programs and films chronicling the “century of national humiliation” that China had suffered at the hands of foreigners, such as Japan and the United States. They would claim that the United States was out to contain China and that it sought to block China’s return to its former glory. “Our youth and intellectuals fell in love with America in Tiananmen Square,” he said. “That must never happen again. So our leaders will smear you, and seek rejuvenation—an end to humiliation at the hands of the West.” He concluded by saying, “Two birds with one stone.” It is a Chinese as well as a Western proverb. “What are the two birds?” I asked him. “There is no more Soviet threat,” he replied. “They collapsed, so Beijing doesn’t need America to protect us anymore.” And the second bird? That, he obviously was indicating, was the United States. He used the word ba. Then he added, “Shi has shifted.”</em></p>

<p><em>No one praised Zhao Ziyang, the reformist leader of the Party who had been placed under house arrest for life, or Hu Yaobang, the mercurial Party leader who had preceded Zhao. The U.S. government decided not to raise the fate of either the deceased Hu or Zhao. No one guessed that they were the true reformers. No one knew the extent of the reforms they had advocated at the top. That information came only later, from Chinese defectors who had worked for Hu and Zhao on democratic political reforms. I still thought that Deng and now Jiang Zemin seemed to be the true reformers. I soon learned that supporting the false reformers and effectively abandoning the true reformers was a mistake that would come to haunt us.</em></p>

<p><em>Bill Clinton had never been to China, but he had visited Taiwan four times as governor of Arkansas. During the 1992 presidential campaign, he attacked President Bush for coddling “the butchers of Beijing.”20 Once Clinton was in office, his secretary of state, Warren Christopher, testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that “our policy will be to facilitate a broad, peaceful evolution in China from communism to democracy by encouraging the forces of economic and political liberalization.” Such efforts were joined by former ambassador Winston Lord, who was so shocked by the Tiananmen massacre and his long misreading of the Chinese leadership that he turned into one of the nation’s harshest China critics. Now serving as assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Lord promised the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tough conditions on China. If there was no progress on human rights and democratic elections, then there would be no favorable trade benefits. In 1993, Democrats Nancy Pelosi in the House and George Mitchell in the Senate led efforts to enact a dramatic set of conditions on China.21 The wishful thinking of the 1980s about Chinese reforms seemed to be extinct.</em></p>

<p><em>On Friday, May 7, 1999, near the end of Clinton’s second term, the United States led its NATO allies in a military strike against Serbia and its proxies. Two B-2 bomber crews lifted off from Whiteman Air Force Base in Knob Noster, Missouri, bound for the Serbian capital of Belgrade. The airmen dropped five JDAM bombs on what was labeled as “Belgrade Warehouse #1.” The target data, provided by the CIA, had been checked and double-checked. But the calculations proved to be woefully—and tragically—wrong. The bombs hit the southern side of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade at midnight, killing three of its employees. This occurred almost ten years after my first encounter with Mr. White. He was not as credible as Ms. Green, but I found him entertaining and had come to like him, and I went to visit him from time to time. On the night of the Chinese embassy bombing, I reached out to ask Mr. White for his forecast of what the Chinese response would be to President Clinton’s apologies. The Belgrade bombing was of course a terrible accident. I knew it would lead to some sort of reaction from China’s government. But I didn’t foresee the magnitude of what was to come. Neither did most U.S. intelligence analysts, who received another warning about Chinese intentions and ignored it. Mr. White immediately concluded that the Belgrade bombing would offer an irresistible opportunity for the Chinese government to implement the new hypernationalism he had told us about. “There are going to be many days of [anti-American] riots,” he predicted. Riots? I wondered. Over something that was so obviously an accident? Senior U.S. officials had apologized already. He was unshakable in his prediction—and for good reason. He knew—and had warned us—about the increasing power of the anti-American forces within the Chinese government. At almost that precise moment, James Sasser, the U.S. ambassador to China, found himself under unexpected siege in Beijing. Mr. White said that China would see this as no accident, but as a probe by the hegemon of a rival who had asked the weight of the cauldrons. “They will see it as an American warning and test of China’s resolve,” he told me.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>When the riot began, Ambassador Sasser had no knowledge of Mr. White’s forecast, which was after all based on his belief that China’s hawks and Warring States allegorical thinking should be taken seriously. Nor did Sasser yet know about the goings on three miles to the west at the secret meeting room of the Chinese Politburo, where the American “attack” on the Belgrade embassy proved to be an irresistible rallying cry. Within hours of the bombing, hundreds of Chinese citizens staged a demonstration outside of the U.S. embassy’s gates. Many hurled rocks, eggs, and tomatoes, and called for “vengeance” against the United States and NATO. Sasser had been in his office that Saturday afternoon, and it soon became clear he could not leave the building safely. For days, as the protest outside swelled into the tens of thousands, the highest-ranking American in China was a virtual prisoner of these Chinese masses, unable to change his clothes or shower. Encamped in his embassy office, he ate freeze-dried military rations and slept on the floor without blankets. On Sunday night, May 9, protesters threw two gasoline bombs through the embassy’s broken windows, igniting fires that marine guards put out with extinguishers. Not far away, chunks of concrete were thrown through the dining room window of the ambassador’s residence, where Sasser’s wife and son had sought refuge. The ambassador was baffled that he couldn’t reach senior Chinese officials by telephone. As Sasser told the New York Times, “I’m not sure they fully appreciate what’s happening on the ground in front of our embassy.”23 Contrary to the ambassador’s assertions, or at least his hopes, China’s leaders knew exactly what was going on. Protests in China are rarely spontaneous, which was why the Tiananmen Square demonstrations a decade earlier had been so frightening to the country’s leaders. In a sign of how well the day’s protests were staged by Chinese intelligence, representatives of major official religious groups arrived and marched in sequence—dozens of Buddhist monks were followed by a contingent of Tibetan monks, Taoists, and then Catholic, Protestant, and Muslim leaders.</em></p>

<p><em>In 2001, the U.S. intelligence community obtained the classified minutes of an emergency Politburo meeting held after the 1999 Belgrade bombing.29 These minutes revealed the Chinese leadership’s true view of America. Each committee member shared his view of the situation and the countermeasures they proposed. If anything, Mr. White’s warning had understated the government’s paranoid nationalism. Jiang Zemin stated, “The United States wants, by means of this incident, to ascertain the strength of China’s reaction to international crises and conflicts and especially to sudden incidents.” Jiang presumed that the air attack could be part of an “even greater plot.” Li Peng, the second-highest-ranking member in the Standing Committee of the Politburo, declared, “Comrades! The bloodstained embassy incident is not an isolated matter and is not merely an insult and challenge to the Chinese people; it is a carefully crafted plot of subversion. This incident, more than anything else, reminds us that the United States is an enemy. It is by no means a friend, as some say.” Li Lanqing, the vice premier, stated, “In the future, direct confrontation between China and the United States will be unavoidable!” He put forward the idea that President Clinton ordered the bombing to “throw a stone to probe the path” to “ascertain the strength of China’s reaction to international crises and conflicts; to ascertain the voice of the people, the stance of public opinion, and the government’s opinion, and the measures it will take.” According to the minutes, not a single leader came to America’s defense. No one stepped forward and raised the possibility that this bombing was an accident. Nor did anyone propose waiting a few hours before condemning President Clinton or asking to hear the American point of view before launching massive student demonstrations in front of the U.S. embassy. So much for the goodwill and trust our programs since 1973 should have built up in Beijing.</em></p>

<p><em>Yet even these revelations did little to shake our complacency and optimism about China. The Chinese hawks obviously existed, we thought, but their influence could—and would—be overcome by more rational, cooler heads. My colleagues began to call for a renewed effort to build trust and reduce misunderstandings. Soon, Jiang Zemin and “friends of China” everywhere uttered the phrase jianshao wuhui, zengjia xinren (“reduce misperceptions, build trust”). China’s “patriotic education” sounded harmless, we concluded. After all, we thought, Americans do the same thing. The anti-Western elements within China’s government were troublesome, but their sentiments were not shared by China’s top leaders, we told ourselves. Most American officials ignored the anti-American signs altogether. Some of the anti-U.S. evidence was even suppressed. On a routine visit in the 1990s to the CIA translation center in Reston, Virginia, I asked a translator why so few examples of Chinese leaders’ anti-American tirades appeared in its reports.30 Almost all U.S. officials relied on translations from the center to follow what was on the Chinese leadership’s mind, because so few can actually read—and grasp the many crucial nuances of—the Chinese language. “That’s easy,” she replied. “I have instructions not to translate nationalistic stuff.” I was puzzled by this. “Why?” I asked her. “The China division at headquarters told me it would just inflame both the conservatives and left-wing human rights advocates here in Washington and hurt relations with China.” Even then my confidence in China’s future was not dispelled, even if it was occasionally shaken. In spite of the information gained from Mr. White and the minutes from the Politburo meeting, I was still not a China skeptic. Many channels of intelligence seemed to prove that this was all a passing phase, a period when farsighted American statesmen needed to concentrate on China’s inevitable progress toward democracy, its economic vulnerabilities, and the fact that the hard-liners were all in their late seventies or early eighties, and would be replaced by moderate reformers if only Washington would show patience.</em></p>

<p><em>And all along the way, of course, our hopes were bolstered by one of our top spies giving us inside information on China: Ms. Green. She too repeatedly assured us that Beijing posed no threat to America and that we needed the Communist leadership as a check against more radical, dangerous Chinese political elements. Her reporting and access to China’s leaders continued to influence American officials until the FBI arrested her on April 9, 2003.31 A CIA source in China had apparently exposed her. She pled guilty to failing to report the $1.7 million she had received from the FBI, and agreed to cooperate to reveal what secrets she had told China. The federal judge ruled that her right to call FBI witnesses whom she needed for her defense had been violated by restrictions placed on her FBI handler by the Justice Department, so the judge dismissed the case. She was charged again, and sentenced to three years of probation, because of her promise to cooperate.32 The FBI inspector general’s report on the case recommended creating a system for placing red flags on the files of Chinese informants who might be providing false information. The FBI’s assistant director for counterintelligence, David Szady, told a reporter that the case highlighted the FBI’s need “to better control its informants, to check the information they provide.”33 The FBI has never declassified its report on Ms. Green’s false reporting. Until the FBI report is released, the public cannot know which was worse—the secrets she gave China or the reassurances she gave Americans. Those who ignored the hawks’ commentaries on the modern-day relevance of the Battle of Red Cliff would easily make such a mistake.</em></p>

<p><em>Sino-American relations, which portrayed the United States as something approximating an evil twin of its actual self, continually working to undermine the Chinese people, even as, in reality, Americans worked to strengthen China. To add to the confusion and mixed messages, while Chinese leaders ordered anti-American attacks in their popular culture, they feigned surprise to American leaders about these attacks. Untold numbers of diplomats and U.S. officials heard variations of a theme I heard many times whenever a particularly undiplomatic anti-American comment made its way to the West: these were the views of a small faction of hard-line conservatives, not the “mainstream” Communist leadership. An emerging generation of the Chinese people now believes a totally different narrative about the United States than the one most Americans know—one that holds that for 170 years America has tried to dominate China. China depicts American national heroes, including Abraham Lincoln, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Roosevelt, as “evil masterminds” who manipulated Chinese officials and others to weaken China. At least to some degree, this twisted view of history distorts their current vision of Sino-American “cooperation,” with many seeing it as just a passing phase in America’s enduring crusade to destroy China’s rightful place in the world.</em></p>

<p><em>I saw a shocking sample of this propaganda when I visited the Chinese National Museum in the fall of 2013. China’s Communist Party hawks and liberal reformers have long quarreled over the facts and presentation of their history, so it is no surprise that since Mao’s rise to power the museum has spent more time closed than open. Founded in 1961 a stone’s throw from Tiananmen Square, it closed at the onset of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. When Deng Xiaoping began to open up China’s economy in 1979, he also reopened its museum of national history. But the museum barely made it into the new century before it was closed again, in 2001. It took ten years and a $400 million makeover before China’s leaders were ready to reopen its doors in 2011. They wanted to accomplish two goals. First, they wanted to make the museum the largest in the world, bigger than the Louvre, the British Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. One floor above its grand entrance hall—which is ten stories tall and the length of almost three football fields—are three titanic cauldrons. (Unlike the unfortunate Chu leader of Chinese legend, I did not ask the weight of the cauldrons.) China’s second goal was for the museum to tell the story of “a great nation whose people are industrious, courageous, intelligent, and peace-loving and have made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization.” Of course, there’s nothing unusual about a national history museum that paints its nation in a positive light. What surprised me about China’s museum, however, is what it says—and what it doesn’t say—about China’s relationship with other nations, including the United States. In a permanent exhibit called “The Road to Rejuvenation,” the museum showcases the ruling party’s version of modern Chinese history, from 1840 to today. That history begins with China “reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society” in a “period of large-scale expansion and plundering” by “Western Capitalist countries.” These “imperial powers”—including the United States—“descended on China like a swarm of bees, looting our treasures and killing our people.” In an oblique reference to the Boxer Rebellion of 1900,6 the exhibit says “the Chinese people unflinchingly attacked the foreign invaders.” Finally, in its battle against Japan in World War II, “the Chinese people won their first victory in resisting and repelling the invasion of a foreign enemy in its modern history.” China then faced “the historic decision of what course to take,” and it chose Mao’s Chinese Communist Party—which “carried out a positive struggle for peace and democracy”—over the “autocratic rule” of the “reactionary” Chiang Kai-shek.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page - (location ~ 1806-1826)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Left unmentioned is that China’s victory in World War II depended on the military intervention of the “Western Capitalist countries” whom the exhibit casts as villains; that American investments and the American market were indispensable to the growth of China’s skyrocketing exports; and that China’s technological progress depended on nearly one hundred agreements with the United States for scientific exchange programs. Instead, the only large photo I saw of any Americans showed civilians disrespecting the emperor a century ago by sitting on the Forbidden City’s imperial throne during the Boxer Rebellion. There was no contextual explanation of why Americans were in China, and the visitor is left with the impression that their primary purpose was to subjugate and humiliate China. Next to the photo was a military map showing where the armies of various foreign powers, including the United States, were deployed in the aftermath of the rebellion. At my invitation, three graduate students from China’s National Foreign Affairs University toured the museum with me. They were in training to become diplomats, and they were well educated from the perspective of the Chinese Communist government. They did not, however, know much about the one hundred thousand Chinese civilians killed by the Boxer rebels, or the role of America’s aid to China in World War II, or the death of twenty million Chinese in Mao’s political campaign and famine from 1959 to 1962, or the death of millions more in a Cultural Revolution that closed the nation’s universities and tore China apart from 1966 to 1976. And although they had heard of the Tiananmen Square protests, they knew better than to talk about them. The graduate students were the product of a decision made by Deng Xiaoping in the wake of the Tiananmen Square massacre—which occurred a mere two hundred yards from the museum that doesn’t mention it.7 After 1989, Deng chose to align with Li Peng and other hard-liners to solidify Party control. Never again, the leaders vowed, would China’s students build Statues of Liberty, quote from the Declaration of Independence, and look to America’s values as admirable alternatives to those of the Chinese Communist Party. Within a year, textbooks had been rewritten to cast America as China’s archvillain, and new policies and regulations ensured that only this official view of America made it into China’s classrooms and libraries. In the latest Chinese version of history, the first American villain is President John Tyler. In the Treaty of Wangxia, signed in 1844, Tyler imposed on China what Mao called “the first unequal treaty signed as a result of U.S. aggression against China.”8 A launching pad for American manipulation of the Chinese, the treaty opened the door to U.S. “illegal actions to exploit China,” according to the textbooks assigned to Chinese students. Tyler and the Americans chose to “wait at leisure while the enemy labors” (in the words of a Warring States stratagem); they didn’t yet have the power to dominate China, but the United States was willing to bide its time. To Chinese hawks, John Tyler—the accidental and forgettable president most famous in real life as the second half of America’s first famous campaign catchphrase, “Tippecanoe and Tyler Too”—was an evil genius, laying the groundwork for America’s plan to assert complete hegemony over Chinese civilization.</em></p>

<p><em>A professor at Renmin University named Shi Yinhong has argued that Lincoln wanted “China to be dominated, or even exploited, within the international community.”10 According to this version of history, that’s why Lincoln sent the diplomat Anson Burlingame across the Pacific to normalize relations between China and the Western world. According to Mei Renyi at the Center for American Studies at Beijing’s Foreign Languages University, the Burlingame Treaty of 1868 forced China “to follow Western cultural norms.”11 It broke down native rituals and China’s system of etiquette in favor of Western diplomatic traditions and made possible Lincoln’s dream of American control of the Pacific. At the turn of the twentieth century, the United States showed its true colors even more. In the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, America joined an eight-nation expeditionary force that defeated the patriotic rebels who were fighting to free China from Western dominance. The foreign army raped and pillaged its way across China, and then the victors imposed $61 billion in reparations (in today’s dollars) on the Chinese people. The United States was willing to “loot a burning house” and, by tricking other nations into attacking China, “kill with a borrowed sword.”</em></p>

<p><em>According to Chinese analysts’ telling of World War II, the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 and the invasion of China proper in 1937 were part of the U.S. strategy to pit the two Asian nations against each other in an endless war that would prevent either from rising to threaten American hegemony in the western Pacific. The Jinan University historian Tang Qing has explained how President Franklin Roosevelt “caused the Chinese people to pay a greater sacrifice in the War of Resistance,” because it was “good for the United States to keep the Chinese fighting the Japanese, make China a base against Japan, [and] promote wartime cooperation between China and the United States, so that the U.S. could someday completely dominate China and the entire world.”14 Deng Shusheng argues that Roosevelt had “the biggest responsibility for feeding the Japanese aggressors” in China. In the style of a Warring States hegemon, Roosevelt “sat atop the mountain and watched the tigers fight,” waiting until both were too decimated to resist American control.15 He “watched the fires burning from across the river” and then “obtained a safe passage to conquer.”16 Reaching new heights of audacity, China’s leaders have now recast Richard Nixon’s opening to China—an opening Beijing instigated and welcomed—as another step in a sinister American plan to dominate China. By pitting the Chinese against the Soviets, the new story line goes, Nixon hoped to provoke a nuclear war between the two Communist countries. Nixon, like Roosevelt before him, watched the tigers fight from atop a mountain so that the United States could later emerge as the global savior and the only remaining superpower. In this telling, the sage Mao saw through this strategy, and he let Nixon visit China only because Beijing needed an ally against the Soviets, even one who would eventually try to betray China. Referring to the ancient state of Shu’s victory over an enemy to the north, one of Mao’s top generals provided the advice Mao followed: “Ally with Wu in the east to oppose Wei in the north.”</em></p>

A Chinese television miniseries, sanctioned by Beijing and broadcast in October 2013, portrays the collapse of the Soviet empire during the Reagan era as a product of American deviousness. The Soviets did not fall because, as is commonly understood, the Communist system could no longer sustain itself. Rather, the Americans deliberately deceived the Soviet Union and caused its collapse.</em></p>

<p><em>This official Chinese Communist Party version of U.S.-China history is, of course, fiction. John Tyler’s Wangxia Treaty was a pro-China compact that established official diplomatic relations, gave Chinese ports most-favored-nation status, and repealed a ban on Americans learning Mandarin. Abraham Lincoln hardly had two minutes to think about China, and the treaty negotiated by his emissary Anson Burlingame was advantageous to the Chinese; it recognized Chinese sovereignty rights that had been threatened by European powers, and it provided the nineteenth-century equivalent of today’s conflict “hotlines” to head off aggression and misunderstandings. In the Boxer Rebellion, the United States was a leader in restraining the abuses of foreign soldiers. Woodrow Wilson made the return of Qingdao to China one of his priorities at Versailles and fought tirelessly—though unsuccessfully—for it. According to Western scholars, Wilson tried his best to return Chinese territory, even risking a Japanese walkout from the peace conference, and extracted a Japanese promise to return the territory, which Japan later violated. Far from seeking to subjugate China, Franklin Roosevelt saved it with American aid and intervention in the Pacific—and by waging war against Japan. Richard Nixon never imagined that his overture to China would spark a nuclear war, and the protests at Tiananmen Square were the product of a Chinese student movement seeking to build a better China, not an American front seeking China’s ruin. Because China’s leaders, on the whole, have not been exposed to an accurate history of the U.S.-China relationship, I wasn’t surprised when Chinese authors warned me in June 2012 that the purportedly secret anti-China plans of Barack Obama were well known in Beijing. Chinese scholars and officials who are truly familiar with America’s history know better than to parrot the official line. They rarely volunteer to American visitors any of these anti-U.S. views. They are not being deliberately dishonest. They are just embarrassed by the history they must teach. On a visit to Beijing in the fall of 2013, I tried asking a professor directly for some of the textbooks in his course. What he didn’t know was that I already had obtained copies of his syllabus and textbooks. “You see, I was just curious,” I began. “I’ve read so much about Presidents Tyler, Wilson, and Lincoln in your books. More specifically, about their, well, ‘evil’ China policies.” The color drained from his face as he stammered, “Y-y-you see, we have recently obtained microfilmed documents from the U.S. archives…” “I know,” I replied. “I’ve reviewed the documents, too. It’s just that I can’t find any mention of these anti-China policies in our U.S. textbooks. In fact, it seems we were very pro-China at the time. If I recall correctly, the U.S. Founding Fathers, Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson in particular, had great admiration for the Chinese system.” He looked out the window, sighed, and explained his predicament. “I do not pick the text materials. The entire faculty is Party members and the Central Committee keeps files on us. Deviating from approved teaching materials would end our careers.” I smiled understandingly. “So this decision is made above your pay grade?” “Yes,” he replied. <em>   </em>   </em> That week, I also visited, for at least the fifteenth time, the prestigious Institute of American Studies. It is three miles from the fifteen-story concrete building known as the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences because it is too large to fit inside the main building. I arrived with a delegation from the American embassy. The facility was adorned with greenery and concrete barriers. We were expected on the fifth floor. Unfortunately, the elevators were out of service and we needed to climb the concrete stairs, with which many older members of our delegation struggled. After our ascent, we walked single file through a concrete hallway with flickering industrial lighting. As I walked down the dusty and poorly lit corridor, I observed that there were still signs on the doors of each unit for the study of American strategy, domestic politics, and foreign policy. When we arrived, we were met by sixteen Chinese scholars, most in their forties or fifties; all were wearing casual American-style clothing from their days as graduate students in the United States.*</p>

<p><em>The director, Huang Ping, who had earned his PhD from the London School of Economics, welcomed everyone and began the session. After about twenty minutes, I posed a few questions about the Chinese portrayal of the United States. “Colleagues, after an exhaustive effort, I couldn’t find one example where the author said something positive about U.S. contributions to Chinese development. Recently, I reviewed a masterpiece of history of how Westerners contributed to China, a book by Jonathan Spence of Yale called To Change China. It discusses missionaries who helped China, the Rockefeller Foundation’s contributions, and how the United States built the MIT of China, Tsinghua University, from the refunds of the Boxer Rebellion. Among the twenty of you who are here, is there any article that expresses any appreciation for American aid to China? Any textbooks or articles that claim the United States helped China during its century of humiliation? Does anyone write that, since 1978, our experts think that one half of China’s growth rate has been due to the United States endorsing China as a place of investment? What about articles or books on how America has lowered tariffs and provided guidance in banking, science, and maritime development? I’ve never seen this acknowledged in a single Chinese textbook. Clearly I must have overlooked something. Can anyone give me just one example?” An uncomfortable silence ensued, with awkward glances exchanged among my Chinese colleagues. One of the scholars meekly answered, “We learned these stories as students in American schools about how you helped us, but they are not included in our authorized syllabi.” Outside of the large group meetings, I was given books and articles outlining plans by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to encircle and blockade China; plunder its maritime resources; choke off its sea-lanes; dismember its territory; aid rebels inside China; foment riots, civil war, and terrorism; and strike China from aircraft carriers.

It discusses missionaries who helped China, the Rockefeller Foundation’s contributions, and how the United States built the MIT of China, Tsinghua University, from the refunds of the Boxer Rebellion. Among the twenty of you who are here, is there any article that expresses any appreciation for American aid to China? Any textbooks or articles that claim the United States helped China during its century of humiliation? Does anyone write that, since 1978, our experts think that one half of China’s growth rate has been due to the United States endorsing China as a place of investment? What about articles or books on how America has lowered tariffs and provided guidance in banking, science, and maritime development? I’ve never seen this acknowledged in a single Chinese textbook. Clearly I must have overlooked something. Can anyone give me just one example?” An uncomfortable silence ensued, with awkward glances exchanged among my Chinese colleagues. One of the scholars meekly answered, “We learned these stories as students in American schools about how you helped us, but they are not included in our authorized syllabi.” Outside of the large group meetings, I was given books and articles outlining plans by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama to encircle and blockade China; plunder its maritime resources; choke off its sea-lanes; dismember its territory; aid rebels inside China; foment riots, civil war, and terrorism; and strike China from aircraft carriers. As is the case with Chinese leaders’ version of the past, the frightening thing about their vision of the future isn’t that they spout lies about the United States; the frightening thing is that they actually believe their own propaganda.</em></p>

<p><em>As evidence, China points to almost every U.S. intervention abroad, no matter how altruistic. As the commission observes, “Beijing has compared the United States to Nazi Germany for the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade; it has labeled U.S. involvement in Bosnia and Kosovo as an attempt to maintain U.S. dominance in Europe; it has characterized the enlargement of NATO as an effort to contain and encircle China; and it has criticized U.S. development of ballistic missile defenses as contributing to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.”21 In short, Chinese leaders believe the United States has been trying to dominate China for more than 150 years, and China’s plan is to do everything possible to dominate us instead. Chinese leaders view the global environment as fundamentally zero-sum, and they plan to show the same lack of mercy toward America that they believe the long line of China-hating American imperialists—dating back to John Tyler—have showed toward them. China’s view of America would be less troubling if Chinese leaders weren’t prepared to act on their misconceptions. While China doesn’t at first glance seem to be preparing to take on the United States, the hard truth is that China’s leaders see America as an enemy in a global struggle they plan on winning. That vision of our relationship explains why, time after time, China aids America’s enemies in an effort to chip away at American power, especially in America’s war against terrorism. For example, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, China’s government produced a video called The Pentagon in Action, which depicts Saddam Hussein as a wise voice of reason and “painstakingly portrays the U.S. government as a wounded bully whose hegemonic power and ego have been challenged and which is obsessed with irresponsible military retaliations,” as the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission put it.22 The China hawks’ recommendation to Deng Xiaoping that he launch a defamation campaign against America has largely succeeded. He tapped into deeply held, popular Chinese attitudes about ancient hegemony. Deng assessed shi both domestically and internationally. He cast aside two decades of rapprochement with the United States, from 1969 to 1989. Yet he did not do so in a manner that alerted or alarmed the U.S. government. He no longer needed a counterbalance to the threat of a million Soviet troops on his border. On the American side, few intelligence officials gave credence to the idea that the Chinese leadership really believed what they were saying about the United States. Nobody in Washington took these anti-American harangues seriously at all. Few Western leaders ever mentioned it in public; most simply didn’t notice. So these claims of a devious America were never rebutted. The few who raised the issue have been told these views are held by only a few fringe hawks in China.</em></p>

<p><em>In June 2012, Bloomberg published an article about the wealth accumulated by relatives of President Xi Jinping.24 Then, in October of that year, the Times reported on the wealth amassed by the sitting prime minister, Wen Jiabao, and it followed it up in a Times-owned online Chinese-written lifestyle magazine with a similar story about secret consulting fees paid by J. P. Morgan to Wen’s daughter.25 In response, China blocked its Internet users from accessing websites run by Bloomberg and the Times.26 The Chinese government likely sees American journalists as just the latest in a long line of Americans out to sow discord among the Chinese people and block China’s legitimate rise. Today, this kind of thinking, standard in China’s elite circles, is taken to bizarre extremes. Colonel Dai Xu, an influential military strategist and a professor at China’s National Defense University, routinely makes headlines in China with allegations about U.S.-led conspiracies. This would not be possible were it not at least tacitly sanctioned by the Chinese government. In 2013, for example, he accused America of waging “bio-psychological” warfare by planting an outbreak of the H7N9 bird flu virus in Shanghai. He has frequently warned that America seeks to reduce the world population by 20 percent, secretly controls China’s industries, and wants to break up China into different states.27 All the while, the U.S. government doesn’t realize that China views America, today and throughout history, as a villain. The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission contracted a major study by the University of Maryland in 2004 “to provide empirical evidence on the messages and tone of Chinese reporting on the United States over time.”28 The commission found that the “U.S. Government has dedicated insufficient resources to collect, translate, and analyze Chinese writings and statements. Consequently, it has a limited understanding of the perceptions of the United States held by Chinese leaders and the Chinese people.”29</em></p>

<p><em>China’s Marathon strategy depends heavily on goodwill from other countries, especially the United States. That goodwill translates into massive foreign investment, the acceptance of Chinese exports, indulgences when the government or state-affiliated organizations are caught stealing technology or violating WTO rules, and looking the other way on human rights abuses. Western countries offer such concessions primarily because their leaders are convinced that overall China is moving in the “right” direction toward freer markets, productive international cooperation, and political liberalization. That perception—or, more accurately, misperception—about China is not the result of happenstance or naïveté, though there is an element of the latter involved. Over the past several years I and other experts have learned from Chinese defectors and dissidents that Beijing has a sophisticated system in place to mislead foreigners about what is going on in their country and reconfirm Western biases and wishful thinking. At the top, the person who runs the system is the number three leader of China.1 The dissident artist Ai Weiwei went to prison after revealing one component of this secret operation, the crackdown on Chinese bloggers who have proven essential to revealing the truth about China to Western reporters.2 As the organization Reporters Without Borders detailed, Ai Weiwei “made a mockery of the surveillance arrangements [he was under by Chinese authorities] by installing four webcams in his office and bedroom which filmed him around the clock. His web feed was shut down after a few hours.”3 Ai Weiwei knows what others do—that the Chinese government, at its highest levels, uses a false reality to cultivate the goodwill of foreign governments, policymakers, academics, reporters, business leaders, and analysts. This is more than an elaborate PR operation. It is an essential component of the Marathon to induce complacency in the hegemon, to hide in plain sight. And the Chinese are succeeding brilliantly. Indeed, they have been successful with this secret, largely undetected operation for decades.</em></p>

<p><em>The first sense that this might not be wholly accurate came that very year, when Westerners became familiar with a book published in Mandarin and released throughout China called Unrestricted Warfare.5 The book had caused a splash in the Chinese military community for the bluntness with which it discussed America’s vulnerabilities. Instead of direct military action, the authors proposed nonmilitary ways to defeat a stronger nation such as the United States through lawfare (that is, using international laws, bodies, and courts to restrict America’s freedom of movement and policy choices), economic warfare, biological and chemical warfare, cyberattacks, and even terrorism. The work raised eyebrows further because it was written by two colonels serving in the People’s Liberation Army—Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui.</em></p>
<ul>

<p><em>A chorus of pro-China academics and business leaders in America quickly came to Beijing’s defense—with the standard line that the colonels were on the “fringe” of Chinese thought and that their ideas should be dismissed. Indeed, the official translation service of the U.S. government refused to translate the book until my office in the Pentagon sent a formal request. Moreover, U.S. officials invited the authors of the book to visit Washington in 2005 (and again in 2013), perhaps under the theory that once they saw what America was really like, they would disavow the views put forward in their book. Instead, Wang Xiangsui went on to produce another volume on lessons from the Warring States for our era. China’s ying pai hawks do not mind being called “fringe,” Wang told me, because “we have a lot of influence.” China’s government operates differently. Its leaders don’t roll out the red carpet for academics, journalists, and scholars who are critical of their government. As is now well known, Beijing is ruthlessly efficient in how it promotes messages that are helpful to its cause and long-term strategy and censors those that are not. As it did after Tiananmen, the government revises official Chinese history and punishes those who do not toe the favored line. Imagine what might happen to U.S.-Chinese relations if U.S. policymakers, or the general public, actually had an unfettered view of the anti-Americanism rife within senior levels of the Chinese government. In Beijing’s view, that cannot be allowed to happen. Indeed, a carefully managed, secret, and audacious PR and opinion-shaping operation, supervised by top leaders in Beijing, is still under way. It is an operation that intelligence officials have known about for many years.</em></p>

Meeting with a group of American officials, she shared a historical vignette from the Warring States period to make a larger point. Between 490 and 470 BC, the story goes, the heads of two warring states were like America and China—Fuchai was the old hegemon, and Goujian was the rising challenger who aspires to become ruler of the world. Fuchai takes Goujian prisoner. The hegemon’s “hawkish” adviser, Wu Zixu, urges him to kill Goujian. Always suspicious of possible threats and eager to preempt them, Wu Zixu warns that Goujian will eventually escape and potentially topple the old hegemon. Other advisers, working secretly with the captured Goujian, systematically defame and undermine Wu Zixu to the point that Fuchai decides that it is Wu Zixu who deserves to die. Eventually, after a long series of manipulations, Fuchai sends his now-disgraced adviser a sword to commit suicide. The popular movie of his story includes this scene because Wu uttered a famous proverb when he demanded that his eyeballs be plucked out after his death and hung on the city gate of the hegemon’s capital so that he could “see” the rising challenger’s troops enter the city in conquest. The now furious hegemon denied his adviser this last request. Goujian meanwhile convinces the king to let him serve as his personal servant for three years in exchange for his freedom, after which Goujian promises to be a strategic partner of the hegemon. When the king gets sick for an unknown reason, Goujian boldly demonstrates his extreme loyalty by tasting the king’s excrement to diagnose his illness. Once he is released, however, Goujian violates his promises. Just as Wu Zixu had predicted, Goujian vows revenge for the humiliation he has suffered. He sells poisoned grain that will not germinate when planted, thus causing a famine. Then he invades the kingdom and captures Fuchai.

<p><em>All the while Chinese leaders, using the stratagem of shi, seek an optimal moment to avenge their grievances, much as Goujian did at the point where Fuchai’s power had so badly deteriorated that the kingdom was ripe for conquest.12 I asked various scholars about this allegory when I made my next trip to China in 2004. They knew it well, held it up as valuable guidance, and even pointed me to several books and articles that addressed the story. An author of one of these works commented, “If you want to control the whole world, you better not appear as being ambitious. Show no aspiration for greatness. If you appear as having an agenda you will be revealed … the success of [Goujian] is a good example.”13 One People’s Liberation Army author commented on the principle that Goujian followed: “Delay action and create a more favorable strategic condition.”14 This, Ms. Lee maintained, was exactly what China is doing with the West. Ms. Lee detailed a secret unit at the top of the Chinese leadership that controlled the media carefully to ensure that only the “right” messages got out about China. The key, she said, was to shape messages to foreign nations, and especially the United States, by first disseminating them in domestic channels. She had heard an American marketing analogy that it is not the quality of the beer that determines successful sales, but the quantity of the distribution channels. She provided three pieces of evidence to support her assertion, although none definitively proved her claim. Her main point seemed inconceivable: China’s leaders devoted tremendous time and energy to controlling the message inside China in a way that would directly influence foreign perceptions of China.</em></p>

<p><em>She revealed that the operation had a $12 billion annual budget and was run by the Politburo’s Standing Committee, which met weekly in a secret room in Beijing, spending much of its time creating messages to be promoted by a propaganda system that controlled Chinese newspapers, television programs, and magazines published overseas, as well as the Chinese Internet. The other component of this operation was a secret unit across the street from the Party leadership’s compound that had more than one thousand employees in its headquarters. It is called the United Front Work Department and has its own intelligence collection and analysis capability. I had visited the department in 1999, but its director told me that the organization’s focus was “domestic” issues. We did not understand the double meaning. Working together, these groups, directly controlled by the Chinese leadership, seek to ensure that only the right messages get out first domestically, and especially to foreign audiences. This may explain why so much Chinese foreign propaganda has a strange ring to it with its proverbs and slogans that make sense only to Chinese, not foreign audiences. Ms. Lee’s first example of the impact of this program was how it supposedly influenced a U.S. congressional vote in 2000 on trade normalization between China and the United States as well as China’s full membership within the World Trade Organization, both of which would be windfalls for China’s economy. The strategy of the program in this instance was to suppress information both inside China and overseas about China’s absolute opposition to relinquishing its socialist economy, and to imply instead that China’s moderate reformers wanted to move to a free market and were likely to succeed in doing so. This line would be needed to win over a generally skeptical U.S. Congress.</em></p>

Their Chinese interlocutors talk in glowing terms about Adam Smith and Thomas Jefferson, and warn about Chinese instability if the country is pushed too hard or criticized too much by outside governments or from internal dissidents. The key theme is simple: China is not a threat. America should help China to peacefully emerge as a global power.</em></p>

<p><em>China has many ways to reach into American centers of thought and opinion. As the Harvard historian Ross Terrill describes the process, “A symbiosis occurs between Americans who benefit from business or other success with China and American institutions. Money may appear from a businessman with excellent connections in China and it is hard for a think tank, needing funds for its research on China, to decline it.”20 Chinese companies have begun to make substantial donations to think tanks and universities to fund U.S. policy studies of China that support Beijing’s views. It is the orchestration of the messages back in Beijing by the Politburo that makes the difference in winning the Marathon. To cultivate more allies, the Chinese government in 2004 launched one of its cleverest operations—the establishment of Confucius Institutes across the world. In a sign of how important the Confucius Institutes are to the government in Beijing, the organization is headed by Liu Yandong, a vice premier and the first woman to obtain membership on the Politburo. Confucius is of course a perfect symbol to convey the image of a kindly, complacent China. In the West, the name conjures notions of a wise, peaceful philosopher known for clever sayings. Officially, the Confucius Institutes offer Chinese language and cultural instruction to interested foreigners, often in partnership with local universities. But what they also do is whitewash China’s history, portraying China to foreigners as a pacifistic, happy nation that considers Confucius the sole guide to understanding Chinese culture. The institutes encourage a reinterpretation of Sun Tzu’s Art of War as a nonviolent treatise. Students are regaled with stories of happy Confucian families and cultural heroes who implement sincere and honorable courses of action.</em></p>

<p><em>As Jonathan Lipman, a professor of Chinese literature at Mount Holyoke College, warns, “By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways.”29 Similarly, a professor at the University of Miami noted that China’s generosity comes with strings. “You’re told not to discuss the Dalai Lama—or to invite the Dalai Lama to campus. Tibet, Taiwan, China’s military buildup, factional fights inside the Chinese leadership—these are all off limits.”30 As Bloomberg News reported, “When a Beijing organization with close ties to China’s government offered Stanford University $4 million to host a Confucius Institute on Chinese language and culture and endow a professorship, it attached one caveat: The professor couldn’t discuss delicate issues like Tibet.”31 Sydney University, one of Australia’s most exclusive educational institutions, received withering criticism for canceling a planned visit by the Dalai Lama over the university’s fear it would damage its ties to China and funding for its Confucius Institute.32 I visited a Confucius Institute in Washington, DC, and was surprised to see that the “unpleasant” fifth of the five “Confucian Classics” had been included in the curriculum—it is the Spring and Autumn Annals, which includes the rise and fall of all five ba of the Warring States period. Canadian professor Terry Russell, whose university refused to accept Chinese money to establish an institute on campus, said, “They’re nothing more than a propaganda and public relations exercise within the legitimizing framework of a university.”33 It is difficult to know exactly what the Confucius Institutes demand from universities, since much of the negotiations take place in secret. A reporter for the Nation claimed to have gotten hold of the language in one such agreement. It read as follows: “The two parties to the agreement will regard this agreement as a secret document, and without written approval from the other party, no party shall ever publicize, reveal, or make public, or allow other persons to publicize, reveal, or make public materials or information obtained or learned concerning the other party, except if publicizing, revealing, or making it public is necessary for one party to the agreement to carry out its duties under the agreement.”34 Critics warn that in addition to academic censorship, the Confucius Institutes may provide a cover for “industrial and military espionage, surveillance of Chinese abroad and undermining Taiwanese influence.”35 In Sweden, several staff members at Stockholm University demanded that the university sever ties with the Nordic Confucius Institute on claims that “the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm was using the Confucius Institute to carry out political surveillance, covert propaganda and inhibit research on sensitive areas such as the Falungong.”36 A professor at Canada’s University of Manitoba expressed his concern that the institutes employed Chinese faculty who would “monitor the activities of Chinese international students studying there.”</em></p>

<p><em>One of the most respected China scholars in the United States, Perry Link, has been denied access to China for eighteen years because of his refusal to echo what Beijing would prefer he writes. “The costs to the American public,” Link says, “are serious and not well appreciated.… It is deeply systematic and accepted as normal among China scholars to sidestep Beijing’s demands by using codes and indirections. One does not use the term ‘Taiwan independence,’ for example. It is ‘cross-strait relations.’ One does not mention Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who sits in prison.… Even the word ‘liberation’ to refer to 1949 is accepted as normal.”42 Academics understand the code, he adds, “but when scholars write and speak to the public in this code, the public gets the impression that 1949 really was a liberation, that Taiwan independence really isn’t much of an issue, that a Nobel Prize winner in prison really is not worth mentioning.”43 I learned about the carrot-and-stick approach to academics firsthand. During the 1980s and 1990s, when I was a prominent advocate for military sales to China and considered a strong promoter of U.S.-China relations, I was warmly welcomed in China. I was given access to Chinese think tanks, scholars, military officials, government workers, and more. I was allowed into the country under a visa reserved for academics and scholars. In September 2006, that changed. My increasing skepticism about China within U.S. government circles led to my becoming the subject of a profile in the Wall Street Journal. The article’s tone was set from its opening lines: “Michael Pillsbury, influential Pentagon adviser and former China lover, believes most Americans have China all wrong. They think of the place as an inherently gentle country intent on economic prosperity. In that camp he lumps the lower ranks of the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, most U.S. investors and the majority of American China scholars, whom he chides as ‘panda huggers.’ Mr. Pillsbury says his mission is to assure that the Defense Department doesn’t fall into the same trap.”44 “Beijing sees the U.S. as an inevitable foe, and is planning accordingly,” I stated in the article. “We’d be remiss not to take that into account.” Elsewhere I said that “we must start with the acknowledgment, at least, that we are unprepared to understand Chinese thinking. And then we must acknowledge that we are facing in China what may become the largest challenge in our nation’s history.”45 This, needless to say, was not the line favored by those in Beijing.</em></p>

As the Washington Post noted, many other journalists “have been threatened with expulsion and others have had long delays getting visas approved.”56 Bloomberg News reporters have accused their bosses of withholding pieces on China out of fear of similar repercussions.57 Bloomberg journalists compared the situation to “Nazi-era Germany, where news organizations had censored themselves to maintain access to the country.”58 The crackdown on the Internet in China is both well known and extensive.</em></p>

The Chinese also strong-arm Western corporations to assist in their censorship activities. In 2006, the Quality Brands Protection Committee, which represents more than two hundred multinational companies operating in China such as Toyota, Apple, and Nokia, sent an e-mail to its members informing them of the Chinese authorities’ concerns about efforts by their employees in China to bypass the Great Firewall and communicate with other corporate branches outside the country, and warning them they may be visited by police.62 Apple acquiesced to a Chinese government request to remove applications connecting users to a television station and overseas bookstore featuring anti-China content.

Eutelstat, a French satellite provider, worked with the anti-China TV station NTDTV until 2005, when the provider sought to win state-affiliated Chinese clients.63 The NASDAQ also has acquiesced to Chinese pressure.

<p><em>It was three hours before the war game ended, but when the final move was made, the map on the floor was like a chessboard showing checkmate, with the American king trapped and defenseless. For the first time in the history of Pentagon-sanctioned military simulations, the United States had lost a war game. To win, I had employed tactics derived from my evolving understanding of Chinese strategy. The weapons and military strategy that guided my tactics had their roots in ancient Chinese warfare, and their modern incarnations are being developed by the People’s Liberation Army each day. They are called the “Assassin’s Mace”1—a weapon in ancient Chinese folklore that ensures victory over a more powerful opponent. Twenty similar war games were conducted by the Pentagon over the next few years. Whenever the China team used conventional tactics and strategies, America won—decisively. However, in every case where China employed Assassin’s Mace methods, China was the victor.2 The lessons acquired from these simulations were a driving factor behind the Obama administration’s strategic “Asia pivot.”3 Many American officials—myself included—were slow to realize that China’s strategy is largely designed in response to Chinese fears, which we have consistently been slow to understand. What’s worse is that we have often held a flawed perception of the basis for China’s fears. The accumulation of significant evidence—particularly the information provided by Ms. Lee—helped some but hardly all of us to open our eyes to just how wrong we were.</em></p>

<p><em>Western-led efforts to “encircle” their country, there is little evidence that China seeks to intentionally incite a war with America. Indeed, military confrontation in the near term could be one of the greatest threats to the Marathon strategy, unraveling years of patient, assiduous efforts to build China into an economic and geopolitical hegemon. Chinese leaders know that building, in the near future, a military capable of parity with the conventional capabilities of the U.S. military—with all the ships, aircraft, tanks, and soldiers (although the People’s Liberation Army, with 2.3 million soldiers, dwarfs the U.S. Army) that would entail—would cause alarm in Western capitals and potentially provoke an arms race. Chinese leaders are playing a long game, aiming to build up their deterrent capability quietly and to improve their conventional forces gradually.</em></p>

<p><em>In ancient Chinese folklore, there is a legend of a hero confronted by a more powerful enemy. Stronger than a giant and armed with the most expensive and technologically advanced weapons of the day, the adversary was feared by all. But the hero did not shrink from challenging this mighty enemy in a fight to the death, because the hero had a secret weapon. Hidden in his wide shirtsleeve was a short, lightweight, spiked club capable of splitting a sword—or a skull. On its own, the club—or mace, as it was called—did not appear dangerous, but in the hands of the hero, it could be used to knock out an enemy with a single blow. He had been trained in its use for years, and the combination of the peculiar weapon, the element of surprise, and the hero’s knowledge of his enemy’s weakest point spelled doom for his seemingly superior adversary. The legend is similar to the biblical story of David and Goliath, but instead of the underdog being saved by God the Chinese hero is saved by a secret weapon called shashoujian. The term is formed by three Chinese characters meaning “kill,” “hand,” and “mace.” Roughly translated into English, it means “Assassin’s Mace.” The Assassin’s Mace is the trump card that ensures victory over a powerful opponent. The term can be traced at least as far back as the Warring States period, and is used in ancient statecraft texts, martial-arts novels, and China’s daily military newspaper. The Chinese refer to the Assassin’s Mace in a variety of contexts. In the context of dating, a man with an Assassin’s Mace has a subtle appeal that makes him irresistible, even to the hardest-to-get woman. When running a business, an executive with an Assassin’s Mace has a particular skill that allows him to surpass larger competitors. When playing soccer, the team with an Assassin’s Mace has a goal scorer who cannot be stopped.</em></p>

<p><em>Assassin’s Mace technologies fall under a military doctrine dubbed in Chinese military circles “the Inferior Defeats the Superior.” For this doctrine to be successful, China assumes it can initially lull the opponent into complacency, or deceive him to act in ways that will help China win. Superior intelligence information about the opponent is also vital, particularly to anticipate the opponent’s actions, to be able to deceive him, to disrupt his coalition, to stealthily build a countercoalition, and to strike at just the right moment to disrupt the shi and move events in China’s favor. These assessments are akin to identifying acupuncture points that, if struck at the right time, will paralyze the more powerful opponent. I first came across the term “Assassin’s Mace” in 1995 when reading an article titled “The Military Revolution in Naval Warfare,” written by three of China’s preeminent military strategists. The authors listed new technologies that would contribute to the defeat of the United States. They linked military supremacy in outer space to success in naval operations. “The mastery of outer space will be a prerequisite for naval victory with outer space becoming the new commanding heights for naval combat.… The side with electromagnetic combat superiority will make full use of that Assassin’s Mace weapon to win naval victory.” They called for China to pioneer in “Assassin’s Mace weapons” such as tactical laser weapons, which “will be used first in antiship missile defense systems,” and stealth technology for both naval ships and cruise missiles. “Lightning attacks and powerful first strikes will be more widely used,” they noted.5 In addition, the authors listed a host of tactics that would be essential against a superpower like the United States, such as assaulting radar and radio stations with smart weapons; jamming enemy communication facilities via electronic warfare; attacking communication centers, facilities, and command ships; destroying electronic systems with electromagnetic pulse weapons; wiping out computer software with computer viruses; and developing directed-energy weapons.</em></p>

<p><em>America saw conflict only through the lens of military means, instead of the broader strategic picture encouraged by ancient Chinese thinkers such as Sun Tzu, which emphasized intelligence, economics, and law. “Clearly, it is precisely the diversity of the means employed that has enlarged the concept of warfare,” Qiao and Wang wrote in their controversial 1999 book Unrestricted Warfare. “The battlefield is next to you and the enemy is on the network. Only there is no smell of gunpowder or the odor of blood.… Obviously, warfare is in the process of transcending the domains of soldiers, military units, and military affairs, and is increasingly becoming a matter for politicians, scientists, and even bankers.” Two days after the September 11 attacks, the two colonels were interviewed by a Chinese Communist Party newspaper and said of the attacks that they could be “favorable to China” and were proof that America was vulnerable to attack through nontraditional methods.</em></p>

The ongoing 863 Program encompasses development of dual-use technologies, with both civilian and military applications, including biotechnology, laser technology, and advanced materials. The program has also laid the foundations for China’s “indigenous innovation” strategy, which is embedded in the 2006 National Medium- and Long-Term Plan (MLP) for the Development of Science and Technology (2005–2020). China’s indigenous innovation strategy encompasses the country’s efforts to identify, understand, reinvent, and employ certain technological capabilities—for both military and civilian uses—through foreign R &amp; D investment, technology transfers, and the training of Chinese engineers and scientists at corporations and research institutes overseas.</em></p>

Rather than attempting to replicate the U.S.-style system of power projection, as the Soviets did, China has elected not to do so because it would be a violation of the rules of the Warring States–era lessons for China to provoke the hegemon, or ba, prematurely. Chinese leaders have studied how the United States had become alarmed at the Soviet Union’s military buildup, and how this buildup supposedly provoked the Americans to end wartime cooperation with Stalin and initiate the Cold War and a massive U.S. trade and investment embargo on the Soviet Union.

Chen Youwei, a defector from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, identified several pathologies in Beijing’s decision making: reading the worst intentions into an adversary’s actions, ideological ossification, and disconnection from reality.14 Strangely, the Chinese had presumed that China was at the center of American war planning.</em></p>

<p><em>Another key difference I discovered when reviewing People’s Liberation Army materials and documents was that China is prepared to use what it calls a “warning strike” that would increase shi and tilt the flow of events in China’s favor. Da ji zeng shi, a term that appears in Chinese military texts and is discussed among military insiders, means “strike with force to increase shi.” While China has historically not used force for territorial conquest, it has instead done so for political motives of a different sort: to achieve psychological shock, reverse a crisis situation, or establish a fait accompli.40 As in the surprise intervention against U.S. and UN forces in Korea in 195041 and in surprise offensives against its neighbors India (in 1962), the Soviet Union (in 1969), and Vietnam (in 1979), Chinese military leaders believe that the preemptive surprise attack can mean the difference in determining the outcome of a military confrontation and can set the terms for a broader political debate (such as a territorial dispute). There was nothing particularly rational about China’s intervention in 1950 when the United States had an enormous military advantage—a nuclear monopoly, possibly a hundred thousand troops who could march north across the Yalu River, and aircraft carriers within striking distance. For Chinese leaders in 1950, the calculation did not come down to the traditional military balance. Today, the greatest likelihood of military confrontation between the United States and China may come through a similar misunderstanding, and a calculation by Chinese leaders that a shock strike will not lead to a broader escalation.</em></p>

<p><em>To execute a warning strike, the People’s Liberation Army needs the shashoujian. Chinese officials are highly reluctant to talk with Americans about their military’s exploration of Assassin’s Maces. When I asked a senior Chinese military strategist about it, he told me that the term absolutely could not be discussed. However, after seeing references to Assassin’s Mace weaponry in three military books and more than twenty articles by modern military strategists in China, I was able to piece together a portrait of the arsenal the Chinese are discussing—and building. The Assassin’s Mace weapons are far less expensive than the weapons they destroy. They are developed in as much secrecy as possible. They are to be used at a decisive moment in a war, before the enemy has had time to prepare. Their effect on an adversary is confusion, shock, awe, and a feeling of being overwhelmed. As the Department of Defense wrote in its 2002 report to Congress on China’s military capabilities, China’s strategy emphasizes “operations that will paralyze the high-tech enemy’s ability to conduct its campaign, including operations to disrupt and delay the enemy campaign at its inception and operations that are highly focused on identifying the types and locations of enemy high-tech weapons that pose the greatest threat.”45</em></p>

<p><em>One perceived U.S. weakness is America’s reliance on high-tech information systems. No nation in the world has been as active as China in exploring the defenses and vulnerabilities of computer systems involving key U.S. military, economic, intelligence, and infrastructure interests. According to Larry Wortzel, who served as a commissioner on the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, “strong evidence has emerged that the Chinese government is directing and executing a large-scale cyber espionage campaign against the United States.”53 Although China routinely denies such attacks, the People’s Liberation Army has sixteen spy units that “focus on cyber penetrations, cyber espionage, and electronic warfare.”54 The first years of the twenty-first century demonstrated that those spy units—and other Chinese cyber warriors—have tremendous capabilities. Major General William Lord of the U.S. Air Force has characterized Chinese actions as “a nation-state threat” and has observed that “China has downloaded 10 to 20 terabytes of data” from a Pentagon computer network.55 The Washington Post reported in 2013 that a classified study by the Defense Science Board revealed that cyber intruders had accessed more than twenty-four American weapons system designs, including “the Patriot missile system, the Aegis missile defense system, the F/A-18 fighter, the V-22 Osprey multirole combat aircraft, and the Littoral Combat Ship.”56 The Post added that “senior military and industry officials with knowledge of the breaches said the vast majority were part of a widening Chinese campaign of espionage against U.S. defense contractors and government agencies.”57</em></p>

<p><em>In the years since Titan Rain, a single unit of the People’s Liberation Army—Unit 61398—“has penetrated the networks of at least 141 organizations, including companies, international organizations, and foreign governments,” according to Wortzel.59 In addition, a group of China-based hackers called the Hidden Lynx has been linked to several of the most infamous cyberattacks coming out of China. The Hidden Lynx hackers have attacked tech companies such as Google and Adobe, financial service providers, defense contractors, and government agencies.60 An American cyber security firm says that the hackers “have the tenacity and patience of an intelligent hunter” and are “pioneers of the ‘watering hole’ technique” of “infecting computers at a supplier of an intended target and then waiting for the infected computers to be installed and call home.”61 In a related development, according to Paul Strassmann, a former senior U.S. information security official, more than 730,000 American computers are infested by Chinese “zombies”—malicious software packages that infect computers and allow hackers to turn them into “slave” computers for use in cyberattacks that can bring down a network or website with an overwhelming data dump.62 Major General Sun Bailin of China’s Academy of Military Science has written that the United States depends too much on “information superhighways” that are vulnerable to attack by “electrical incapacitation systems” that could disrupt or destroy electrical power systems, civilian aviation systems, transportation networks, seaports, television broadcast stations, telecommunications systems, computer centers, factories, and businesses.63 In Weapons of the 21st Century, Chang Mengxiong, the former senior engineer of the Beijing Institute of System Engineering, wrote that “attacking and protecting space satellites, airborne early-warning and electronic warfare aircraft and ground command sites will become important forms of combat.”64</em></p>

Consider this assertion from an official People’s Liberation Army newspaper: Some people might think that things similar to the “Pearl Harbor Incident” are unlikely to take place during the information age. Yet it could be regarded as the “Pearl Harbor Incident” of the 21st century if a surprise attack is conducted against the enemy’s crucial information systems of command, control, and communications by such means as … electromagnetic pulse weapons.… Even a superpower like the United States, which possesses nuclear missiles and powerful armed forces, cannot guarantee its immunity.… In their own words, a highly computerized open society like the United States is extremely vulnerable to electronic attacks from all sides. This is because the U.S. economy, from banks to telephone systems and from power plants to iron and steel works, relies entirely on computer networks.… When a country grows increasingly powerful economically and technologically … it will become increasingly dependent on modern information systems.… The United States is more vulnerable to attacks than any other country in the world.66</em></p>

<p><em>In 2004, the United States sent seven of its twelve carrier groups into the waters around China in a show of tremendous force, but without the communications and intelligence satellites flying high above them in space, each battle group would have been incapable of communicating. For two decades, China has been building a number of Assassin’s Mace weapons to destroy or incapacitate those satellites, including a land-based laser that would either blind American satellites or blow them up. It has also begun to build “parasitic microsatellites.” As their name suggests, these small devices would cling to an American satellite and either disable it or hijack the information it gathers. Other Chinese microsatellites could neutralize an American satellite through electronic jamming, EMP generation, or pushing the satellite out of orbit.</em></p>

<p><em>China has additionally explored ground-based antisatellite missiles that simply blast satellites out of the sky. In a successful test in 2007, China used such a weapon to destroy a defunct Chinese weather satellite. A Pentagon report said, “The test raised concern among many nations, and the resulting debris cloud put at risk the assets of all spacefaring nations, and posed a danger to human space flight.”68 Joan Johnson-Freese of the U.S. Naval War College has observed that China’s test left “over 3,000 pieces of debris irresponsibly created by the kinetic impact that will dangerously linger in and travel through highly populated low earth orbits for decades.”69 Among the more troubling things about China’s antisatellite test was its lack of transparency. “China has not explained the intent of this weapons test,” said a National Security Council spokesman after the test, “nor has it stated whether or not it plans future tests.” He added that China had offered no explanation of how its test was “compatible with its public stance against the militarization of space.”70 Perhaps the most disturbing thing about this test was the U.S. intelligence community’s failure to anticipate it. In the Pentagon’s three previous annual reports to Congress about the People’s Liberation Army, the secretary of defense told Congress that China could destroy a satellite “only” with a “nuclear weapon.”71 The Washington Times reported that the test “raised alarm bells” by exposing “a key strategic vulnerability,” and some American defense officials “said that there are major gaps in U.S. intelligence about which other space weapons and capabilities China has or is developing that could cripple or disable U.S. satellites, which handle about 90 percent of all military communications, as well as intelligence and missile guidance.”72</em></p>

<p><em>In addition to depending on satellites, another weakness of the U.S. military is relying on long supply lines for ammunition, fuel, and other resources essential to waging war. In the First Gulf War, the U.S. Navy used nineteen million gallons of oil a day and twenty times more ammunition than in the Korean War. None of that would have been possible without open sea-lanes, which are vulnerable to asymmetric attacks from submarines, sea mines, torpedoes, and carrier-killer missiles, all of which are already in China’s arsenal. Partly because of the threat it is able to pose to American sea lines, the submarine is believed by China’s Navy Research Institute to be the most important ship in the twenty-first century. China is also developing an Assassin’s Mace to neutralize America’s air superiority. The AGM-88 High Speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) is attached to American military planes and protects them by homing in on the radar emissions of incoming surface-to-air missiles before shooting them out of the sky. American air superiority depends largely on the HARM, but the Chinese have already created black boxes with thousands of microtransmitters that broadcast 10,000 signals on the frequency HARM uses to detect a surface-to-air missile. China likely hasn’t yet perfected the technology but, if it can, the box would give HARM the impression of 10,001 incoming missiles to set its target on—the 10,000 decoy signals and the one, almost impossible to find, real missile.</em></p>

<p><em>In short, whether it involves fighting an enemy army, navy, or air force, China’s “operational theory,” as the Pentagon has reported, calls for “destroying the enemy command system; crippling the enemy information systems; destroying the enemy’s most advanced weapons systems; crippling the enemy support (logistics) systems; and denying the enemy the synergies that accrue from its technological superiority.”80 To use a metaphor the Chinese use, Beijing’s strategy is to be like the boxer who uses his knowledge of vital body points to knock out a bigger opponent. Americans are more familiar with Greek mythology’s similar story of a powerful warrior with a weak spot. For two decades, the Chinese have been building arrows designed to find a singular target—the Achilles’ heel of the United States. Some hawks told me in Beijing in 2013 that they could not gauge clearly how serious America may be about President Obama’s so-called “rebalance” and “pivot” to Asia.81 They seemed worried whether China might have miscalculated, and whether America would overreact to the Assassin’s Mace program by building stronger forces aimed at China. If America continues its current plan to reduce defense spending by $1 trillion over the next decade, the Chinese said, there will be no money to fund any “rebalance.” I replied by telling the truth: it is hard to predict if U.S. defense spending will be increased to deal with China.</em></p>

The U.S. strategies examined included protection of the domestic market, financial subsidies of domestic companies, and export promotion. The course examined America’s practice of enforcing antitrust measures to intensify competition, another American example China has followed. The American system of securities regulation attracted more capital from investors and made the United States the home of the largest and most efficient market in the world. She added that the overarching lesson was that government-fostered industry expanded the overall size of the American market. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the United States promoted big business firms to increase their markets, in part via subsidies. Chinese Party officials were taught that the Americans stole the technology for the automatic, gradual reduction mills in which carloads of wheat and oats were processed into flour and cereals. The first firm to use this stolen European technology was the Pillsbury Company, for flour, she said with a laugh, looking squarely at me.2 The U.S. government supposedly helped brewers such as Anheuser-Busch, soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola, and others to build factories abroad. I knew some of this was true. The United States overtook Germany’s leadership in the paper industry with new technology following mergers fostered by the U.S. government in 1900, the course taught. Similarly, in the steel industry, America’s government somehow aided Andrew Carnegie to become the steel industry’s first hegemonic leader, in 1879. Next, the Americans decided to dominate the production of copper and aluminum by acquiring European technology. The Americans then came to dominate the rubber and oil industries in the 1880s.3 B. F.

<p><em>Chinese leaders over the past two decades have persuaded the world that the nation is on the path toward economic freedom, replete with private property rights and a free market. Covers of Time and Newsweek boast of China taking “the capitalist road,” with Western-style democracy following behind. China’s vigorous pursuit of modernization since 1978, assisted by the World Bank and other Western institutions, has achieved remarkable success. China has enjoyed a nearly constant economic boom for more than thirty years. Despite minor fluctuations over this period, its economy has grown at a rate roughly three times the global average. Since 2001, China’s annual rate of growth has averaged 10.1 percent. In 1980, China’s nominal GDP was about $70 billion. By 2011 it had risen to more than $7 trillion.6 An economic backwater in 1980, China now boasts the world’s second-largest economy, behind only the United States. Some ninety-five Chinese corporations appear on the 2014 Fortune Global 500 list.7 Five of these are in the top fifty.8 In 2000, there had been none. China is now the world’s largest producer of automobiles, the largest energy user, and the largest emitter of carbon dioxide.9 It remains the world’s most populous country, with a population of 1.35 billion, despite significant efforts to limit population growth.10 This is nothing short of an economic miracle, and the West—including the United States—is largely responsible for it. Media and political commentators hailed the movement of China toward a capitalist, free market economy—although China was doing anything but. By 2014, roughly half of China’s economy would still be in the government’s hands, decades after the myth that capitalism had arrived.</em></p>

<p><em>According to most Western experts, that is attributable to modest reforms and a willingness to keep the currency artificially low, which allows for cheap labor, cheap manufacturing, and the undercutting of Western prices.11 Yet what has accelerated Chinese growth more than anything is not reform at all, but a commitment to subsidizing state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which still comprise 40 percent of China’s GDP.12 These SOEs, or “national champions,” as they are known inside the halls of government in Beijing, are a vital component of the Hundred-Year Marathon. Despite their inefficiencies, they have successfully undercut Western competitors to help fuel the nation’s economic rise.13 This commitment to a ruthless brand of mercantilism traces back to China’s earliest days, when competing governments in the Warring States era used state-controlled economics as an extension of warfare. China’s economy remains misunderstood. The world’s leading economists plead some ignorance about how China’s economic juggernaut really works, which is one reason why China has been able to claim that they are making steps toward economic liberalization, without much scrutiny or pushback. Ronald Coase, a Nobel laureate in economics, and Ning Wang warned in 2013, “There is still much we don’t know about China’s market transformation. Moreover, many of the reported facts on the subject are actually not true.”14 They cite surprising examples of China’s leaders concealing their strategy and telling foreign leaders they have pursued more private, free market approaches than is actually the case.15</em></p>

<p><em>In other meetings, China played down its growth prospects after learning from internal estimates in the early 1990s that its GDP would surpass that of the United States by 2020 or so. Why would China conceal strategic elements of its successful thirty years of economic growth? Why exaggerate the degree of movement toward a free market? The answer is simple: Beijing’s leaders, drawing on the most basic lessons of ancient Chinese statecraft, have sought to induce complacency by promoting soothing messages and concealing alarming information that could give rise to suspicions about China’s hostility. If China’s internal estimate about surpassing America by 2020 had been made as a loud, boastful announcement, it might have alarmed the hegemon and provoked an attempt at containment. So, instead, the approach was to tell foreigners how many obstacles China faced and to downplay its prospects. In recent years, a few Western analysts have challenged this conventional wisdom advanced by China’s leaders.16 They see China pursuing a nakedly mercantilist strategy of subsidizing key industries and government-guided efforts to acquire ownership of foreign natural resources and energy reserves born of an almost paranoid view that oil and gas are reaching a global peak of production. In their thinking, wars over natural resources are inevitable in the decades ahead, and therefore China must buy resources overseas and stockpile them at home, while denying scarce resources to others.17 Many Chinese strategists adhere to the “peak oil” theory: the idea that energy supplies will soon dwindle and prices will consequently skyrocket. According to this perspective, the world is a giant wei qi game board, where resources such as copper, oil, and lithium must be obtained and denied to competitors. Echoing a concern prevalent in much analysis of China’s geostrategic challenges, one analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Science writes, “Facing the challenge of global energy supply shortages, in the future China and the U.S. cannot avoid disagreement and conflict (especially on the issue of oil).”18 Wang Xianglin writes, “Expert analysis indicates, China will face peak oil in 2015: oil production will peak and from there begin to decline. After crossing peak oil, China will face a huge problem: shortages of oil and gas will intensify; oil consumption will increasingly rely on imports.”19</em></p>

<p><em>Along with rats, flies, and mosquitoes, sparrows were one of four “pests” that, in Mao’s thinking, posed a threat to hygiene—and economic progress—in China. “The Great Sparrow Campaign” of 1958, part of the Great Leap Forward, was born of a burning desire to move China’s agrarian economy into the twentieth century. Mao and his top advisers reasoned that the sparrows consumed thousands of tons of grain that could be used to feed the Chinese people and fuel the communes and mass industrialization that were the centerpieces of China’s competitive drive to bring its economy on a par with those of the West. Farmers fanned out across the countryside, tearing down nests, breaking eggs, and chasing flocks of sparrows with pots and pans. The campaign was devastatingly effective. By 1959, sparrows were nearly exterminated in China. What the Chinese authorities hadn’t realized was that, in addition to grains, insects constituted a large component of the sparrows’ diet. In the following years, without sparrows as predators, locusts ravaged harvests—and this was compounded by severe droughts. Between 1958 and 1961, more than thirty million Chinese perished due to famine. Communist China’s first major experiment to make itself economically competitive relative to the West had failed. When Deng Xiaoping became China’s “paramount leader” in 1978 and contemplated his nation’s economic backwardness under Mao, he vowed to pursue a different economic course.20 Deng saw that without a vibrant private sector, China could never be a highly competitive global power. He began pushing major reforms, thereby shifting away from traditional Marxism-Leninism by degrees. Summarized as the “Four Modernizations,” these reforms focused on agriculture, industry, technology, and the military. Among the most important were those that integrated national planning with market forces in the service of “socialism with Chinese characteristics.”</em></p>

<p><em>When it came to attaining global economic hegemony, Deng drew on the ancient Taoist principle of wu wei—literally translated as “without doing” or “without effort,” and operationally defined in this case as achieving a great deal by drawing on the strengths of others. Deng was pragmatic enough to realize that in the post–World War II global economic order drawn up at Bretton Woods in 1944, it wasn’t enough to rely on the tenets of Marxism-Leninism. To catch up to the United States and other highly developed countries, China would need to join the WTO and obtain loans from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank—all of which were aggressively pushed by political, government, and business elites in Western capitals. The supposed willingness of China, a Communist country, to meet the conditions for WTO membership was still justifiably viewed skeptically by many in the U.S. government; as a result, China’s entry into the WTO took fifteen years and was the subject of the most detailed agreement ever made with any new member of the WTO—contrasting strongly, for example, with the far less demanding terms applied to India a few years earlier. China knew that it would benefit enormously by joining the WTO. But would the Americans let them in? When China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to accept the organization’s provisions that member governments not influence, directly or indirectly, the commercial decisions of their state-owned enterprises.25 However, China has not kept this commitment. All Chinese SOEs operate to serve state objectives rather than respond to market forces, and the Communist Party isn’t shy about directing SOE investments. If a Chinese mining company is directed to exploit a mine in Afghanistan or Angola to expand China’s political footprint, it will do so, even if it must do so at a loss.</em></p>

<p><em>Ms. Lee revealed that China’s leaders’ strategy was to leave nothing to chance by aiding those who favored the vote, and suppressing information about their mercantilist economic strategy. They reasoned that if Congress knew that a free market was off the table for the foreseeable future—if not forever—the vote would not pass. They launched a program of propaganda and espionage that was more sophisticated than anyone in the U.S. intelligence community suspected. She explained in detail how China had studied American political fault lines to exploit divisions within the U.S. foreign policy community, using as a guide an old essay by Mao Zedong from the 1930s about how to analyze political differences.27 Among the key messages China sent then were that the SOEs would be phased out, free market policies would be forthcoming, China’s currency would not be manipulated, China would not accumulate large trade surpluses, and America’s innovations and intellectual property would, of course, be respected. WTO membership requires all this. Also, during the debate over China’s admission to the WTO, the China Initiative failed to persuade President Clinton to insert conditions into the trade deal to influence the fates of two thousand to three thousand Chinese political prisoners. The House of Representatives approved trade normalization on May 24, 2000, by a vote of 237 to 197.28 The Senate followed suit, giving its approval on September 19 by a vote of 83 to 15.</em></p>

<p><em>In a classic example of wu wei and studying shi by turning the energy and momentum of others to your advantage, China would borrow the best techniques from the West to develop stock and debt capital markets, a mutual funds industry, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, currency markets, foreign participation, an internationalist central bank, home loans and credit cards, and a burgeoning car industry—all with the active tutoring from institutions such as the World Bank and private firms such as Goldman Sachs. Meanwhile, the Communist government, when it wasn’t looking the other way, openly sanctioned and encouraged audacious covert programs to steal technology and Western intellectual property. Counterfeiting became the basis for as much as 8 percent of China’s GDP.30 Justin Lin, a top Chinese economic adviser who in 2008 would become the World Bank’s chief economist, was one of the best sources about the origins of China’s economic strategy, through his writing and speeches, many of which were in English.31 His credibility was beyond reproach. I remembered his name from my two years at National Taiwan University in 1971, when he was elected student body president. Ten years later, he defected to mainland China and earned a master’s degree in political economy at Peking University before obtaining a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago.

During that period, the World Bank released a few vague reports to the public about the need for China to move toward a free-market economy.36 In private, the World Bank’s economists recommended something different: they explained how China could overtake the United States. Apparently the bank did not suggest concealing the whole idea, and instead pretending that China was going capitalist. Rather, that was a Chinese decision based on the Warring States–era principle of inducing complacency in the old hegemon.</em></p>

<p><em>The World Bank pointed out that China’s savings rate was remarkably high, and that if China could obtain productivity growth—especially via the use of science and technology—coupled with restrained population growth, the ambitious goal was achievable. The bank made six recommendations in private, not revealing them to the outside world because the bank had made the politically sensitive decision to endorse China’s socialist approach and made no genuine effort to advocate for a true market economy. The first recommendation, for the two decades after 1985, was that China needed to change the composition of its exports to increasingly emphasize manufactured goods, particularly high-tech products. Second, the bank warned Chinese leaders not to slide into excessive borrowing from foreign sources. Third, the bank economists warned China to encourage foreign direct investment only for advanced technology and modern management techniques. The fourth recommendation was to spread foreign investment and joint ventures out from the special economic zones to a wide range of locales. The fifth recommendation was to phase out its foreign trade companies and let each SOE establish its own foreign trade arrangements. And, finally, the bank recommended that a long-term framework for the whole Chinese economy should be worked out regularly.38 By 1990 the largest World Bank staff mission was in Beijing. Without revealing the bank’s behind-the-scenes role, China’s leadership followed almost all of the international organization’s advice. Peter Harrold became the bank’s principal economist and was assisted by E. C. Hwa, who had been deeply involved in the 1984 study. One Chinese vice minister told me years later that Hwa was one of the economic founding fathers of China, even though he had virtually no recognition outside of Chinese economic circles.

<p><em>After detailed studies, the Chinese team and the World Bank economists decided against privatization and political reform. Together, they determined that the most stable path of economic growth was to preserve the socialist economic policies and the political monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party. They rejected privatization partly on the grounds that they estimated China’s industrial SOEs were valued at 2 trillion Chinese yuan, and the population was estimated to have only 1 trillion Chinese yuan in total savings, so it simply would not be possible for China’s citizens to invest and become owners in state companies. China would thus not take the road of privatizing its Soviet-style enterprises. There would be no private property in the countryside, either. Even in 2014, six hundred million Chinese farmers still do not own their land. Zhou produced a confidential paper for the World Bank to detail his plan to reject Western, market-oriented economics and lessons from the positive experiences of Russian and Eastern European reform. Some of this debate was revealed by Mao Yushi in 2013, when he was awarded the 2012 Milton Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty by the Cato Institute.40 If American officials had known about this conflict between moderate free-market advocates and the ying pai hawks, perhaps different decisions could have been made in Washington.</em></p>

<p><em>China has taken the concept several steps farther, building on the model of the South Korean chaebol and Japanese conglomerates. In the Chinese SOE model, the Communist Party creates the SOE and defines its strategic purposes. These purposes must advance the interests of the state, typically via advancing one or more of the Four Modernizations. The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party selects all key SOE managers, many of whom come from the country’s intelligence or military services, and those ties continue as the SOE moves forward. Chinese state banks favor SOEs over private sector firms. With large capital injections, these national champions are encouraged to acquire foreign technology and secure raw materials from abroad. All of these government subsidies, while inefficient and corruption-fostering, give Chinese corporations a huge competitive edge against the West.41 Almost all of the nearly one hundred Chinese corporations on the Fortune Global 500 list are SOEs. In a remarkable reversal, the normally private sector–oriented World Bank and International Monetary Fund acknowledged that the Chinese regulations required the SOEs to safeguard the interests of the Chinese government. This was a violation of China’s original commitments. Indeed, the World Bank went so far as to warn in a confidential paper in 1993 that China’s other reforms would fail if the SOEs could not be improved and ultimately made profitable.42 The concept was to “corporatize” them, which meant a relaxation of state control to push some of the enterprises to go bankrupt or be dissolved, while others would be consolidated from many small, loss-making ones into a few large, profit-making ones. This is the beginning of what became known a decade later as the “national champions” system. The World Bank advised China to go much farther—and so China did. The bank recommended creating portfolio holding companies, much like mutual funds in free-market economies. The most shocking proposal of all was that stock exchanges should be established to sell shares in the SOEs. (Stock markets are for private companies, not government agencies.) This arrangement was euphemistically termed partial privatization.</em></p>

<p><em>Today the state-owned and -controlled portion of the Chinese economy is huge. Available data suggest that SOEs and entities directly controlled by SOEs account for more than 40 percent of China’s nonagricultural GDP. If the contributions of indirectly controlled entities, urban collectives, and public town and village enterprises (TVEs) are considered, the share of China’s GDP that is publicly owned and controlled is roughly 50 percent, or more, of the entire economy. This is an inconvenient truth if you want to convince the old hegemon that you are going capitalist and that your middle class will soon demand democracy. China’s five largest banks hold 50 percent of all Chinese deposits. In a country of 1.35 billion people, there are just twenty-nine banks owned by the central and local governments, thirty-four banks in Special Administrative Regions, and two privately owned banks.45 These sixty-five Chinese banks contrast with the approximately nine thousand privately owned banks in the United States.46 By the end of 2013, China’s central bank had accumulated approximately $3.66 trillion in foreign exchange reserves.47 This enormous sum is roughly 40 percent of China’s entire GDP.48</em></p>

Their systems of corporate governance are seldom transparent. Interference by the state creates inefficiencies in how China’s SOEs operate.

Western companies such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have restructured the SOEs and have taught their executives how to comply with international financial and accounting requirements.51 As a result, the SOEs were able to go public through initial public offerings on global stock exchanges from London to New York, with secondary listings in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong.</em></p>

A dual listing in 1997 raised more than $4.5 billion52 for what is today the world’s largest cellular phone company. The company is so big that on the day Apple announced it would sell the iPhone through China Mobile, Apple’s stock rose by nearly 4 percent.53 Westerners have also been crucial to the education of Chinese entrepreneurs and investors. For example, China has lured away American and European business school leaders to help them develop their own MBA programs. The former heads of the London Business School and the Rotterdam School of Management now work at the China Europe International Business School, and business schools such as Duke’s and Harvard’s are educating business leaders in China.54 Chinese citizens with Stanford and Wharton MBAs often spend time at U.S. venture capital and private equity firms, where they are quickly deployed to China to identify investment opportunities.</em></p>

The possible threats in an increasingly globalized world are obvious. Could Chinese spy services monitor or reroute certain lines of telecommunications? Could they use these networks to steal information?

Not playing by the rules pays off.

According to one study, a dramatic example of how quickly China has expanded its global market share has been by increasing subsidies and offering tax breaks, cheap land, and technology in four key industries: steel, auto parts, glassmaking, and paper production—all fields where China has no major comparative advantage, including in labor.62 According to classical free-market economics, this should be considered distorting, inefficient, and costly. But the results proved the opposite. China in a decade overtook the United States to become the world’s largest producer of paper. China achieved more than 30 percent of global glass production, and exports exceeded domestic production. China shifted from a net importer of steel in 2000 to the world’s largest producer and exporter, with 40 percent of the global market. After 2001 China became one of the world’s largest producers and exporters of auto parts. This was not due to cheap labor, which amounts to less than 10 percent of costs in all these sectors, nor to a deliberately undervalued currency. Needless to say, China did not draw attention to these impressive conquests of market share, nor explain them publicly. China also engages in counterfeiting of non-Chinese products on a large scale. This includes the unauthorized production, distribution, or use of products and their design or key technologies via unauthorized means, without permission. In 2002, ABC News estimated that foreign firms’ losses due to counterfeiting in China stood at $20 billion annually.63 Others believe the total is far higher.64 In a recent speech to the National Association</em></p>

<p><em>China has advocated the internationalization of the renminbi to replace the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency of choice.58 As part of China’s “going out,” Chinese enterprises have embarked on so-called overseas bottom-fishing (haiwai chaodi), which allows them to buy up foreign companies at discounted prices.59 With plenty of capital from state banks, and little need for a return on investment, the SOEs have ample opportunity to acquire their competitors. At the heart of Chinese economic policy is a superagency called the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). It determines state policy for strategic industries and approves major investments, as well as mergers and acquisitions of SOEs. The NDRC has sweeping powers to impose prices for all consumer goods, from bottles of whiskey to gasoline. The NDRC also appears to be the nerve center of Chinese economic strategy.60 As China expands even farther into international markets, there’s one thing China’s competitors can count on: China won’t play by the rules. According to a recent U.S. government report, China continues to raise many nontariff barriers to protect its industries from foreign competition. These barriers include “state trading, excessive domestic subsidies and stockpiling of commodities, discriminatory taxes, uncalled-for antidumping duties, and slow approvals of biotechnology applications for U.S. crops.”61 All of these violate WTO strictures.

It will be able to exert over its neighbors and allies the robust influence that America has enjoyed for decades. And, at least to some degree, China will be able to shape the world in its image. What will that world look like? Will it be easier or harder for the oppressed to throw off autocracies? Will the air we breathe be cleaner or more toxic? Will the institutions that protect trade and foster freedom be stronger or weaker? Some of these questions are, of course, unanswerable. Yet one thing is certain: if China’s government retains its current priorities, continues its same strategies, and clings to the values it has held dear since Mao Zedong’s rise to power, a world shaped in China’s image will be very different from the world we know today.</em></p>

Our nation was founded by individualists such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, and a collection of rebels who rejected being a part of the British Empire. We celebrate them. Our Bill of Rights protects the right of all Americans to speak as they so please, to pray as they wish, and to live in homes safe from unreasonable searches by law enforcement. The right of all Americans to chart the course of their own destiny is sacrosanct. For China, however, personal rights in the American sense do not exist. The literary scholar Lydia Liu points out that an American missionary named Martin, while translating in the 1860s the first text on international law into Chinese, realized the Chinese language did not have a term for rights, so he had to invent a new word, chuan li, still used today, by combining “power” with “benefits.”5 The society the Chinese Communist Party has helped to shape is collectivist, a cultural fact that predates 1949. “In China,” say two international business strategists who have studied the country extensively, “to be human is to be an appendage of a larger humanity.”6 Although there are numerous references to free speech, free association, and religious freedom in China’s constitution, these rights are hardly safeguarded in practice.7 For</em></p>

To be “harmonized” is a euphemism for being censored.16 China makes enormous efforts to erase the memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre. In June 2012, on the twenty-third anniversary of the military crackdown, Chinese censors blocked any reference to it on the Internet in China. When three activists applied for a permit to hold a memorial march, they were subsequently incarcerated.17 When Internet users tried to get around censors by inserting a big yellow duck in the iconic photograph of a student standing in front of a column of tanks, the Chinese government banned the phrase “big yellow ducks.”18 The Chinese censorship army is so widespread that June 4 (the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests) is sarcastically known as “Internet maintenance day.”19</em></p>

China’s predatory Internet practices used to be limited to China, but these tactics are increasingly being deployed internationally. China’s innovative Internet control practices have already been adopted in at least eleven other countries.22 Of course, China may never be able to stop the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal from reporting real news on China.

Another Chinese tactic for propping up autocracies is strategic lending and investment.26 In 2009 and 2010, China provided more loans to firms and governments in developing countries than did the World Bank.27 China uses this economic clout to advance its political agenda around the world. It is currently spending $2 trillion of sovereign wealth reserves to advance an anti-Western agenda through unconditional lending assistance in Africa.28 According to Freedom House, “This unconditional assistance—devoid of human rights riders and financial safeguards … is tilting the scales toward less accountable and more corrupt governance across a wide swath of the developing world.”29 Zimbabwe is “among the most vivid and best-known African examples” of the China effect in the words of Stefan Halper of the University of Cambridge.30 China has been instrumental to the maintenance of Mugabe’s iron grip over his devastated country, first by supplying arms and later by sending Internet surveillance hardware and other technology crucial to his efforts to control the Zimbabwean people.

Three years later, on the day of the September 11 terrorist attacks, a group of Chinese officials in Kabul concluded another agreement with the Taliban covering economic and technical assistance. These were just two of many agreements the Chinese reached with the Taliban. China’s cooperation with the al Qaeda terrorist network was not entirely indirect. Intelligence reports obtained by the Pentagon in December 2001 revealed that China had supplied arms to al Qaeda after the September 11 attacks. The Taliban and the al Qaeda fighters embedded among them took delivery of a shipment of Chinese-made surface-to-air missiles just a week after the attacks, and U.S. Special Forces discovered thirty of these missiles in May 2002. It’s no wonder that one Taliban commander publicly praised China for its assistance, telling an Urdu-language newspaper in Pakistan that “China is … extending support and cooperation to the Taliban government.”38</em></p>

Pollution even crosses the Pacific Ocean and accounts for 29 percent of particulate pollution in California.50 And, of course, global warming respects no national boundaries. A major cause of emissions is China’s reliance on coal, one of the world’s worst air pollutants. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that China burns nearly as much coal as do all other countries combined.51 Even though China has announced steps to improve its environmental footprint, its record suggests that the problem will continue to worsen. China is still one of the few countries that subsidize coal consumption. Fossil fuels account for 75 percent of China’s total commercial primary energy consumption, and it will remain the country’s main fuel for the foreseeable future.52 China’s coal consumption grew by more than 9 percent in 2011, which accounted for 87 percent of the total global rise in coal use.</em></p>

<p><em>CHINA’S GROWTH STRATEGY ENTAILS SIGNIFICANT POLLUTION AND CONTAMINATION To stay in power, China’s leadership knows it needs rapid growth. If we project the current impasse forward three decades, the effects are alarming. Since the 1980s, China has built ten thousand petrochemical plants along the Yangtze River and four thousand plants along the Yellow River.54 As a result of these factories and China’s choice to prioritize development over environmental considerations, 40 percent of the country’s rivers are seriously polluted, and in 20 percent of its rivers the water quality is too toxic to touch safely, let alone drink.55 At least 55 percent of the groundwater in China—and there is not that much groundwater in China—is unfit for drinking. In fact, the wastewater that Chinese factories dump into rivers causes about sixty thousand premature deaths annually.56 Of course, because of the state’s control of information and its vast network of censors, many Chinese do not even know that their drinking water may kill them.57 China’s neighbors are already feeling the spillover effects of its reckless approach to development. Due to water contamination in China, much of the country’s fishing industry has moved into the contested waters of the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and the Pacific Ocean.58 In 2011 alone, the South Korean Coast Guard sent back 470 Chinese fishing boats for illegally entering South Korean waters.59 There are regular disputes like these between China and Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan. They have the real potential to lead to armed conflict. China’s neighbors also have reason to be concerned about China’s spree of dam building. The country plans to triple its hydropower capacity by 2020, which will cause many Chinese rivers to simply turn into a trickle. Because China does not recognize shared water rights and does not share information concerning its water use, China’s neighbors will have to either accept a depletion of their water resources or push back against China in a manner that could be highly risky and destabilizing.60 China’s management of its water resources will have implications not only for Asia, but also for the entire world. By 2050, scientists predict that the world’s population will increase to more than nine billion people, and nearly 70 percent of the world’s population will live in urban areas. This will have serious consequences for the management of waste and water.</em></p>

<p><em>CANCER VILLAGES The human cost of China’s air and water pollution can be seen firsthand in the number of “cancer villages” that have appeared near Chinese factories. Those factories dump waste, toxic chemicals, and other questionable materials into rivers, killing wildlife, ruining the water, causing birth defects, and even leading to death. Largely because the country’s standards remain woefully behind those of industrialized nations—only 40 percent of Chinese regulation is in line with international norms62—China has produced more cancer clusters in a few decades than has the rest of the world combined.63 The damage is not limited to villages alongside China’s rivers. Cancer is now the leading cause of death in Beijing, and high pollution is one of the main reasons.64 China’s cancer rates are still below those of the United States, but if China continues along its current path it won’t stay that way for long. China regularly points out that developed nations had their share of pollution problems while they industrialized. But at least two things make China different. First, China’s industrial revolution is larger, and so the amount of actual and potential damage is unprecedented. China will soon have the largest economy in the world, and with it the largest appetite for fossil fuels, toxic chemicals, and other pollutants. Second, China lacks a robust and productive civil society that represents the interests of the people exposed to carcinogens and the other poisons produced by China’s rapid development. One woman who lives in a cancer village and lost her husband and son to cancer stated, “All I want is to breathe clean air, drink safe water, and use uncontaminated soil … but I guess it is just too much to ask.”65 As Senator Sherrod Brown has explained, “there is no free press to help bring problems to public light,” and even when the truth is exposed, “there is no free civil society to sustain long-term advocacy.”</em></p>

It steals technology, promotes Chinese monopolies, and unfairly insulates its state-owned companies from foreign competition.

China has played by its own rules, and as its power grows an increasing number of countries will be forced to play by those rules as well. A core component of China’s successful growth strategy is acquiring, often through illegal means, foreign science and technology. China has set up counterfeiting factories employing ten thousand to fifteen thousand people.69 China’s national industrial policy goals have the effect of encouraging intellectual property theft, and a massive number of Chinese business and government entities engage in this behavior.70 So dramatic is intellectual property (IP) piracy in China that a software company sold a single program in China and then received thirty million requests for an update.</em></p>

The biggest difference between the SCO and NATO is the nature of the governments of its members. NATO is an alliance of twenty-eight democracies. The SCO is essentially a coalition of autocracies. Although it is possible that the SCO’s observers—such as democratic India—may one day become full members and bring democratic values to the SCO, an alternative future dominated by China seems more likely, due to China’s status as the country with the largest economy and military. Beijing is already expanding its role in the SCO. For example, to assist with financing, China granted billions of dollars’ worth of loan credits for members through the SCO Business Council and Development Fund.87 The SCO also created an International Bank Association and a forum of academic advisers to examine issues such as education, health, culture, and judicial and legislative issues.

As China’s Warring States period shows, the challenger often accused the old hegemon of not showing respect for the royal dynasty. The idea was to appeal to other states to abandon the old hegemon and to support the challenger because the hegemon had demonstrated, by its supposed disrespect of the royal dynasty, that he lacked the legitimacy to rule. This was a slow, multidecade process. Today, a rising challenger must delegitimize the hegemon’s global authority to succeed.

In exchange for effective missile export controls, the United States would “expand commercial and scientific space cooperation with China,” issue a “blanket presidential waiver of Tiananmen Square sanctions to cover all future commercial satellite launches,”91 and increase the number of U.S. satellites that could be launched on Chinese boosters.92 The U.S. proposal wisely included a number additional carrots, as well as several sticks. Through membership in the MTCR, China would gain “political prestige, the ability to shape future MTCR decisions, substantial protection from future U.S. missile sanctions, and [membership] would expedite somewhat the consideration of MTCR-controlled U.S. exports to China,” according to a leaked NSC memo written by Gary Samore. As for the stick, the same memo noted that the United States would “make clear to the Chinese that, as a practical matter, a lack of progress on the missile issue would prevent us from increasing launch quotas and could even endanger the existing [satellite launch] quota.”93 China’s reaction to the offer is highly revealing about its priorities and intentions: it turned America down flat. China was much less interested in technological cooperation and political prestige than in exporting weapons to rogue states. China’s response also tells us much about what a China-led world will look like. Rather than slowing the proliferation of WMD, an increasingly powerful China will accelerate it. Rather than isolating rogue states, China will empower them. And rather than cooperating with the United States and its allies, China will undermine and weaken them at every opportunity, especially when it comes to its own national security. Even if China were to join the MTCR, there is reason to doubt whether it would abide by the regime’s rules. In a devastating report on Chinese arms duplicity, Senator Jesse Helms stated, “During the past twenty years, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has made fifteen formal nonproliferation pledges—seven related to the proliferation of nuclear technology, six regarding the transfer of missile technology, and two commitments undertaken at the time the PRC joined the Biological Weapons Convention in 1997.” He added, “None of these pledges has been honored.” Helms’s staff produced a chart showing the timeline of Chinese broken promises and violations that had undermined U.S. national security. These violations included selling nuclear weapons components to Pakistan and Iran as well as ballistic missile transfers to Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, and North Korea.94</em></p>

But, as explained in chapter 1, China’s notion of “harmony” in the field of geopolitics means unipolar dominance, and as explained in chapter 2, the “Chinese dream” is for China to be the world’s only superpower—unrivaled economically, militarily, and culturally. In sum, if the China dream becomes a reality in 2049, the Sinocentric world will nurture autocracies; many websites will be filled with rewritten history defaming the West and praising China; and pollution will contaminate the air in more countries, as developing nations adopt the Chinese model of “grow now, and deal with the environment later” in a race to the bottom in food safety and environmental standards. As environmental degradation expands, species could disappear, ocean levels will rise, and cancer will spread. Some international organizations will not be able to step in as effectively as they can today because they will be marginalized. Chinese state-owned monopolies and Chinese-controlled economic alliances will dominate the global marketplace, and one of the world’s mightiest military alliances may be controlled by Beijing, which will be able to easily outspend the United States on military research, troop levels, and weapons systems.</em></p>

<p><em>WARNING SHOTS “Better to see once than to hear a hundred times.” —Chinese folk proverb At the beginning of the 2013 film Gravity, the astronauts portrayed by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney receive a troubling message from Mission Control in Houston. The Russians have fired a missile into one of their defunct satellites, and the explosion has created a chain reaction of potentially deadly debris heading toward the Americans on their space walk. A routine mission to repair the Hubbell Space Telescope becomes a fight for survival. In the end, Bullock’s character returns triumphantly to Earth with the assistance of an unoccupied Chinese space station that houses a pod she can pilot home. Amid the glowing reviews, there were a few complaints about the film’s more unrealistic elements. Because of surface tension, it was said, Bullock’s tears would not have floated off her face, as they do in the film. Her journey from the Hubbell Space Telescope to the Chinese space station, with a pit stop at the International Space Station, would have been impossible because the three systems are in different orbits. And Bullock would in reality have been wearing a diaper, not form-fitting underwear—the factual discrepancy most commented upon. But there are other issues with the movie, ones to give us pause. They have less to do with dramatic license than with the Hundred-Year Marathon. First, Sandra Bullock’s character would never have been allowed to enter—let alone operate—the Chinese space station. When Chinese engineers designed their system, they may have deliberately built it so that it could not interface with its American counterparts.1 They wanted no cooperation between the United States and China in space. Second, the Russians have never sent a missile into one of their own satellites, as the movie depicts. But the Chinese did exactly that in 2007. Using a ground-based antisatellite weapon (one that they could someday use against American satellites), the Chinese blasted a defunct weather satellite out of orbit. According to a Pentagon report, China’s test “raised concern among many nations, and the resulting debris cloud put at risk the assets of all spacefaring nations, and posed a danger to human space flight.”2 U.S. intelligence officials were given no warning by the Chinese about their missile launch and in fact had been repeatedly assured that the Chinese government did not have an antisatellite program. The Chinese recklessly created by far the largest, most dangerous space debris field in history, but the Russians get the blame in the movie.</em></p>

That, of course, is just as the Chinese have planned it. <em>   </em>   </em> China’s destruction of its weather satellite in 2007 was the first in a series of warning shots—intentional provocations and hostilities seemingly designed to test the resolve of the United States and allied nations and the boundaries of what is deemed acceptable by international norms—that most of the world has overlooked, ignored, or explained away. The incidents have become steadily more brazen in the years since 2007. Tensions in East Asia, as a result, are at the highest point they have been since World War II. On the heels of the Chinese antisatellite test came a marked shift in tone toward America and its new president, Barack Obama. In December 2009, President Obama traveled to Copenhagen, where representatives from 192 countries had gathered to ratify new global policies on climate change. This summit was marked by a significant change in the public tone of Chinese officials. They demonstrated uncharacteristic rudeness, interrupting Western diplomats on several occasions and providing little constructive input to the discussions.4 Premier Wen Jiabao had already snubbed the other heads of government by refusing to attend most of the negotiations. China surprised observers by making a side agreement with other developing nations that blocked the hoped-for commitments from being included in the climate change draft agreement, which effectively torpedoed the goals of the conference.5 According to a senior U.S. government official, the Chinese defiantly organized a meeting without President Obama at the end of the conference to block U.S. initiatives; their scheme was revealed when President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton intruded into the meeting unannounced.*</p>

<p><em>China’s increased assertiveness is a product of Chinese leaders’ recognition that shi has shifted decisively in China’s favor and America’s relative decline has accelerated faster than they had anticipated. This recognition is partly a product of China’s use of wide-ranging metrics to assess comprehensive national power.10 The 2008 and 2009 global financial crisis, which had originated on Wall Street, was seen in Beijing as a harbinger of things to come. Chinese commentators believed that the U.S. economy would recover but would never be the same. In the coming era, global economic leadership would eventually be more diffuse and less reliant on the U.S. dollar.11 That China has waited until shi has shifted in its favor before acting more aggressively abroad also reflects China’s adherence to the strategic element of having patience, even if that meant having to wait decades. One clue supporting this Chinese recalculation came in 2010. It was a four-page secret briefing given to Chinese officials by a foreign affairs expert of the Central Committee. The briefing sought to answer the question “What is the most important foreign policy challenge our nation faces in the next decade?” According to the notes obtained by the U.S. government, the expert’s answer was, “How to manage the decline of the United States” (guanli meiguo shuailo). He discussed several tactics that could be used to achieve this goal. If accurate, his account implied that China’s surpassing America’s economy would occur within a decade.</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Another piece of evidence about America’s decline came in 2012: the implications of the Chinese reaction to a U.S. government study claiming that the military balance had tilted toward China, as expressed in an authoritative 2011 U.S. National Defense University book, The Paradox of Power: Sino-American Strategic Restraint in an Age of Vulnerability, by David C. Gompert and Phillip C. Saunders. The Chinese translated and circulated the book, telling foreign visitors that they would not accept its policy proposals for restraint but admired its frank admission of relative American military decline and growing Chinese power in nuclear forces, cyberattack, and space weapons.12 Chinese officials told me that its conclusions were a revelation. They said the book indicated that the U.S. government had acknowledged China’s success in changing the regional military balance of power in a manner more favorable to its interests. Indeed, many Chinese political and military figures were surprised by American assessments of how powerful China had already become. Based on comments I heard in Beijing in 2012 and 2013, I concluded that this study inadvertently provided evidence for the Chinese officers who had been debating whether the time had come to exploit the new tilt in the military balance. I was told that many in China’s government and military did not believe the book’s assertion that “there is little stomach in the United States for trying to frustrate China’s rise, encircle it with alliances and forces, or start a Sino-American cold war.”13 Their view was that this was too good to be true and was more likely an intentional effort to deceive China into becoming complacent. Yet they appreciated the authors’ assessment of a shift toward China in the military balance. They were also puzzled why the U.S. government would release evidence of American decline and what amounted to a pessimistic assessment of shi, from the U.S. perspective. They dismissed my assertions that the two authors were merely speaking for themselves.</em></p>

<p><em>Reflecting the subjective nature of balance of power assessments, some American scholars reject the notion that the balance has tilted, or is likely to tilt, toward China in the future. Michael Beckley of Tufts University argued in 2011 that “the United States has not declined; in fact it is now wealthier, more innovative, and more militarily powerful compared to China than it was in 1991”18 before asserting that “China is rising, but it is not catching up.”19 Of course, both of these considerations are relevant for Chinese and American assessments of their own and each other’s power.20 Furthermore, because different states assess the balance of power differently, Beijing may begin to believe it is pulling ahead long before the United States agrees. In the final decades of the Marathon, this could create mutual misperceptions, which very well could lead to war.</em></p>

<p><em>With the Marathon on the verge of success, the Chinese now see room to be more belligerent than ever before, while still keeping their greater aspirations in check. Their more urgent priorities are close to home. Tensions have flared in the seas surrounding China, both to the south with neighboring Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei, and to the east with Japan. Since 2010, China has dusted off centuries-old maps seeking to prove China’s historical linkage to islands in the East and South China Seas to justify asserting expansive territorial claims. The South China Sea became a flash point when, at a summit meeting in May 2010 with the United States, China asserted its claim to the Spratly Islands, adding tens of thousands of square miles of ocean with rich energy and fishing resources to its exclusive economic zone and extending its territorial waters nearly to the coasts of Vietnam and the Philippines.</em></p>

<p><em>In response to Japan’s protests, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stated, “The Japanese side is not entitled to make irresponsible remarks and malicious accusations against China” and “We call on the Japanese side to stop all actions that undermine China’s territorial sovereignty.”35 Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan caused a controversy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January 2014 when he likened the tensions between China and Japan over the East China Sea islands to pre–World War I relations between Germany and Britain. It was lost on no one that those two nations had gone to war in 1914 despite having robust economic ties with one another—as China and Japan do today.36 A major test of the effectiveness of China’s Marathon strategy will be how Japan responds to the growing aggressiveness in its western waters. For at least the past two decades, Beijing has pursued the Warring States–era axiom of undermining the hawks in a rival state—in this case, Japan. China has launched an anti-Japan demonization program across Asia, including focusing on Japan’s domestic audience. The message has not changed: Japan’s hawks are covertly trying to restore Japan’s 1930s-style militarism, and as such they must be identified and rendered politically impotent. To demonize Japan, China has sent the message that it regards Japan’s wealth, and its position as America’s main ally in Asia, as products of ill-gotten gains from World War II. Professor Arne Westad of the London School of Economics calls this phenomenon a “virulent new form of state-sanctioned anti-Japanese nationalism.”37 Nations in the “Confucian zone” of civilization are supposed to accept China’s natural leadership, not attempt to resurrect old empires or align with a foreign hegemon such as the United States.38 An August 2013 survey of Chinese and Japanese citizens’ views of each other’s countries helps shed light on these issues.</em></p>

<p><em>We needed to do something on November 23, 2013, when China’s Ministry of National Defense announced the establishment of an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) in the East China Sea. While other countries, including Japan and the United States, had declared their own ADIZs in the past, China’s stood out for its unusually strict requirements, requiring aircraft in the zone not only to identify themselves and provide their flight plan, but also to maintain radio contact with the Chinese ADIZ administration.34 Shortly after Beijing’s declaration, I was delighted that U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel authorized two B-52s to overfly the ADIZ to assert America’s nonrecognition of Beijing’s requirements. I advised him China would not react.

The survey found that more than 90 percent of Chinese respondents hold unfavorable views of Japan, a startling rise from 62 percent the year before. Similarly, 90 percent of respondents in Japan had an unfavorable or relatively unfavorable view of China, compared with 84.3 percent the previous year. Hostility has peaked at the highest level since the previous nine annual surveys. When asked why overall Sino-Japanese hostility had increased so significantly, many of the respondents said that the Senkaku/Diaoyou Islands issue was the reason: 77.6 percent of the Chinese respondents and 53.2 percent of the Japanese surveyed identified the islands dispute as a key source of their animosity. The next most common reason was historical grievances: 63.8 percent of Chinese cited “Japan’s lack of a proper apology and remorse over the history of invasion of China” as one of the reasons they hold negative views of Japan. Perhaps the most ominous finding was that 52.7 percent of Chinese respondents and 23.7 percent of their Japanese counterparts said that they believed there will be a military conflict between China and Japan at some point in the future.</em></p>

These analysts write that the visits are used for “spiritual mobilization for further aggressive expansion in China.”43 Many Chinese strategists believe that the growth of Japan’s military strength is bound to become “uncontrollable.”</em></p>

Moreover, he argues, because the United States wanted to use Japan to counter the Soviet Union, North Korea, and China during the occupation, “it preserved Japan’s entire national machinery and war machinery (although the names were changed).”49 Chinese scholars have noted that Japan is “constraining China’s territorial policy and interfering in China’s sovereignty over the Nansha [or Spratly] Islands and the Diaoyutai [or Senkaku] Islands.”50 The so-called Miyazawa doctrine to form a regional forum to discuss Asian security issues modeled on the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe was criticized by Chinese authors as a thinly veiled effort to contain China. The New York Times reported in 1993 that a Chinese official revealed that the Chinese military has asked for additional defense spending in the five-year plan to deal with Japanese military capabilities.</em></p>

<p><em>In 2009, my colleagues and I were still making the mistake of assuming that the Chinese think the way Americans do. We misunderstood the evidence of a new Chinese aggressiveness toward the United States and toward its neighbors because it did not fit our existing assumptions and because our Chinese contacts had assured us that a series of episodes that seemed to indicate greater Chinese assertiveness were not part of any overarching plan. I was not alone in giving China the benefit of the doubt. After all, my understanding of the Marathon strategy was that there was no real urgency in making it to the finish line—at least not anytime soon. A series of seemingly random episodes of China’s increasing assertiveness became the subject of American debate. China’s message was that there was no overarching pattern—or strategy—linking these separate episodes. This fit with earlier messages that China had no grand strategy. Indeed, China’s leading expert on America, Wang Jisi, had written an essay to this effect in the journal Foreign Affairs.</em></p>

<p><em>One reason the U.S. intelligence community and I missed the signs of China’s greater assertiveness was a total misreading of China’s apparent moderation in its stance toward Taiwan. Starting with Hu Jintao’s administration in the 2000s, China has avoided threatening Taiwan with force, instead placing greater emphasis on softer and more indirect methods, largely involving economic means, of influencing the island’s government.56 In this way, China has made significant inroads among Taiwan’s ruling and opposition parties, corporate leaders, media, and populace. Hu reportedly confided to his closest advisers that it is easier and cheaper to “buy” Taiwan than to conquer it.57 China and Taiwan signed an Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement in 2009 to normalize economic relations between the two countries, and there are now nearly seven hundred cross-strait flights weekly, with 2.8 million Chinese visiting Taiwan in 2013. Moreover, Beijing has made direct efforts to co-opt Taiwan’s business elite, many of whom have become strong advocates of cross-strait rapprochement. Pro-China Taiwanese merchants have purchased major Taiwanese newspapers and television stations, thereby enabling Beijing to influence these media outlets, as well as others that have received Chinese funding.</em></p>

I had not anticipated that there would be a phased approach as the balance of power tilted more and more against the declining United States. Thus I realized that a new scenario was emerging: China would become more assertive with each improvement in the balance of power relative to the United States, according to Beijing’s calculations. Another reason why I had been slow to see the acceleration is because I believed China’s claims that its grand strategy was fixed and designed to lull others into complacency. Chinese scholars and officials stressed that their intention was to exercise strategic patience for at least the next two decades, I thought.

As Harvard University’s Alastair Iain Johnston wrote of these conferences, “More moderate voices—those who believed there had been no major shift in power … were not obviously on the defensive in these debates. In other words, the question about whether and how much the United States was in relative decline has not been answered” at this time. “Moreover,” he continued, “there is no evidence that the core decision making group on foreign policy in this period … accepted the claim that a major shift in the distribution of power had occurred or had given China new opportunities to push its interests.”</em></p>

Scholars and intelligence officials began to speak of China’s being at least ten years or possibly even twenty years ahead of schedule.62 China’s leaders debated whether to make a tactical shift in pursuing the Marathon strategy, a kind of dash to the finish.</em></p>

<p><em>And although the United States and many of China’s neighbors have complained, China has paid essentially no price for its behavior from its rival. Each of these episodes is a result of China applying one or more of the nine elements of the Hundred-Year Marathon, as outlined in chapter 2: 1. Induce complacency to avoid alerting your opponent. 2. Manipulate your opponent’s advisers. 3. Be patient—for decades, or longer—to achieve victory. 4. Steal your opponent’s ideas and technology for strategic purposes. 5. Military might is not the critical factor for winning a long-term competition. 6. Recognize that the hegemon will take extreme, even reckless action to retain its dominant position. 7. Never lose sight of shi. 8. Establish and employ metrics for measuring your status relative to other potential challengers. 9. Always be vigilant to avoid being encircled or deceived by others. Looking forward, the United States should expect a new phase of increased Chinese assertiveness. Beijing will push diplomatic demands that seem impracticable or inconceivable today—and other nations will yield to China’s pressure.</em></p>

<p><em>Another long-standing Chinese grievance has been its decades-old territorial claims on neighboring regions containing valuable natural resources. It is possible that China will be able to compel the United States to revoke the military-related components of its security treaties with China’s neighbors. Since the 1990s, Beijing has stridently condemned these agreements and the U.S. arms sales made under their auspices, labeling them “relics of the Cold War.”63 A hegemonic China is likely to do far more than merely condemn these arrangements. As China increases in strength and bellicosity, those voices opposing China’s growing aggressiveness, like Shinzo Abe’s and Benigno Aquino’s, will likely become louder and more distressed. Unfortunately, America has shown little awareness of the challenge and, in any event, even less of an appetite to confront it.</em></p>

<p><em>STEP 1—RECOGNIZE THE PROBLEM The China that Beijing’s leaders want us to see is not the real China. America’s political and opinion leaders need to distinguish between the “messages” they are sent by the Chinese versus the underlying reality. Sun Tzu and Confucius agreed on the necessity of discerning appearance from reality. Even though he was one of its biggest advocates, Sun Tzu warned against falling for deception by clever adversaries. Confucius advocated the supreme importance of calling things by their correct names, what he called zheng ming, as the foundation for correct strategy. Put simply, know what the opponent is trying to make you think about his nature; do not accept appearances at face value.</em></p>

You can’t come from behind in a race against your competitors unless you know the respects in which you have fallen behind. Every year, the Chinese create an annual analysis of their competitiveness relative to the United States. Why isn’t America doing the same thing? The nonprofit Council on Competitiveness, established in 1986, seeks to bolster America’s global economic competitiveness. It brings together CEOs, university presidents, the heads of national labor organizations, and prominent research institutions. The council’s publications detail how the United States will drop in manufacturing competitiveness through at least 2017, while China will remain number one, due to factors such as Beijing’s high levels of investment in manufacturing and industry.2 The U.S. government should be conducting a similar—but more robust—measure of American competitiveness. The White House should provide Congress with an annual report that includes trends and forecasts about how the United States is faring relative to its chief rivals. Many departments of the U.S. government, including the intelligence community, would have to be involved. It need not cover all other nations, just the top ten—beginning with China.</em></p>

He notes that while the launch was viewed as a challenge to America’s technological and military dominance, it also spurred U.S. investment in its engineering and science education and private sector innovation. China’s rise has yet to stimulate a similarly robust response. Hughes has put forward a number of promising policy proposals to remain competitive. These include collaboration between the U.S. private and public sectors to increase competitiveness; fiscal and monetary reform; technological innovation; the creation of a lifelong learning culture;3 and increased U.S. civilian research and development.4 Similarly, Ralph Gomory of New York University, a former vice president at IBM, suggests countering China’s “massive government subsidies of land, energy and technology, in addition to low- or no-cost loans” by promoting a “real manufacturing renaissance in America.”5 Patrick Mulloy of the China Commission also details the need for a new national competitiveness strategy because “overall the situation poses a long-term threat to America’s economic primacy and even our national security.”6</em></p>

Their field marshals were men such as Václav Havel, Lech Walesa, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. And with their courage and passion and principles, they brought down the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain. But they didn’t do it alone. Presidents from Truman to Reagan championed their cause. When they were imprisoned, American presidents demanded their release. When they needed money, Americans sent them funds. When they needed a platform for the free speech their regimes denied them, Americans shared their printing presses and broadcast their battles and beliefs into millions of homes through Radio Free Europe. Today China has increased its persecution of Buddhist Tibetans and Muslim Uighurs. In Tibet, the government has imposed curfews, arrested protesters, killed innocent civilians, and transformed the region into, in the recent words of the Dalai Lama, a “hell on earth.”8 In Xinjiang, the Internet and phones are routinely shut off, and the percentage of Han Chinese in Tibet and Xinjiang has risen dramatically due to state-sponsored migration.</em></p>

The organization’s purpose is to promote legal reforms, fund “house churches” in China, and assist imprisoned Christians.

Wolf inserted a clause in the 2011 federal budget that prohibited NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from engaging in any joint scientific activities with China that year.16 However, Wolf is something of a lone wolf in seeking to rein in China’s ability to access U.S. technological expertise. He has not been able to push through similar legislation since his 2011 effort. Due to the success of the “Wolf clause” in denying Chinese journalists access to the launch of the U.S. space shuttle Endeavour and Wolf’s other work on human rights in China through the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, he has become a victim of Chinese cyberattacks himself.17 Wolf’s intense concern about the theft of sensitive technology, military secrets, and intellectual property is greatly needed. But he announced his retirement from Congress in 2014.

Yet it remains a mystery why the United States doesn’t do more to fight China’s censorship and propaganda campaigns against the Chinese people. China’s major news outlets are state-owned. The responsibility for calling out corruption frequently falls on foreign reporters in China. Western media have largely risen to the challenge—pointing out instances of embezzlement, harassment of anticorruption officials, mismanagement by state-owned enterprises, tax fraud, sex scandals, targeting of foreign companies, bribery, and so on. For instance, within a span of only a few months in 2013, the journalist Andrew Jacobs reported on the questionable detention of a Chinese journalist for “picking quarrels and making trouble”20 and the killing of unarmed Tibetans in Sichuan Province.21 Similarly, David Barboza, a New York Times correspondent in Shanghai, wrote a story in October 2012 about former prime minister Wen Jiabao’s family’s $2.7 billion in questionably obtained assets.</em></p>

Chinese leaders also pressure American technology companies to censor their websites in China.

During the 1980s, Secretary of State George Shultz insisted that China abide by an international norm against nuclear proliferation.40 The United States helped to build organizations and train individuals inside China to reverse Beijing’s unwillingness to join the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT).41 Senator Joseph Biden described China as a nation that is “rapidly becoming a rogue elephant among the community of nations”42 and called for withholding most-favored-nation trading status for China unless China changed its nonproliferation policies and practices.

<p><em>I was curious as to how Myanmar leaders saw China’s long-term strategy. Did they, like so many in the West, view China as a capitalist wannabe, intent on a peaceful rise in the community of nations? Mitchell said that Myanmar intellectuals were reading the views of Lee Kuan Yew, the eighty-nine-year-old former prime minister of Singapore and one of Asia’s most revered leaders. Lee, hailed as the father of the Singaporean miracle, has won widespread praise in the West; Richard Nixon once compared him to Churchill, Disraeli, and Gladstone,54 and Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush were among many hailing him as a visionary leader. Yet curiously many in the West have chosen to ignore his views on China. A Myanmar official pointed me to a new book on Lee’s views that was for sale at Rangoon’s five-star Strand Hotel, a Victorian-style structure built during the British imperial era and that now stands as a relic of a declining Western empire. “The rise of China [is] the issue about which Lee undoubtedly knows more than any other outside observer or analyst,” wrote the book’s editors, the Harvard professors Graham Allison and Robert Blackwill.55 I scanned the book myself and found that Lee has clearly understood China’s long-term strategy, a country he has observed closely for decades, long before most of us in the West. “It is China’s intention to be the greatest power in the world,” Lee says bluntly, “and to be accepted as China, not as an honorary member of the West.… At the core of their mind-set is their world before colonization and the exploitation and humiliation that brought.” Beijing, Lee continues, has masterfully harnessed the aspirations of the Chinese people—a far cry from their position after Tiananmen in 1989. “If you believe that there is going to be a revolution of some sort in China for democracy,” he states, “you are wrong.… The Chinese people want a revived China.” Asked by the book’s interviewers how China would become number one, Lee replies, “Their great advantage is not in military influence but in their economic influence.… Their influence can only grow and grow beyond the capabilities of America.”56 Lee seems to confirm essential elements of the Marathon strategy, though he believes that the period of Chinese dominance is still decades away. “The Chinese have figured out if they stay with [claims of a] ‘peaceful rise’ and just contest for first position economically and technologically, they cannot lose,” he observes. “To [directly] challenge a stronger and technologically superior power like the United States will abort their peaceful rise. China is following an approach consistent with the Chinese television series The Rise of the Great Powers, produced by the Party.… I believe the Chinese leadership has learnt that if you compete with America in armaments, you will lose. You will bankrupt yourself. So, avoid it, keep your head down, and smile for forty or fifty years.”</em></p>

I advocate doing this by borrowing concepts from China’s Warring States period, which entails respecting the quality and originality of China’s strategic thinking.

<p><em>Beijing’s strategy to replace the United States as the dominant geopolitical power requires America’s goodwill and assistance. The United States must behave as Great Britain did during the gradual American rise and eclipse of the British Empire. That’s one reason China works so hard to shape American perceptions of it. Liu Mingfu, in The China Dream, advocated that China try to shape American perceptions of China. He said that China must make America become “not a Satan but an Angel.” His approach parallels a book by four ying pai hawks titled The New Warring States Era.59 These and other Chinese hawks assert that the coming decades will be filled not with wars and territorial conquest but rather with struggles over economics, trade terms, currency, resources, and geopolitical alignments. There are at least three intellectual traps we may fall into that will prevent recognition of the true nature of the problem. The first is premature fear of a China threat. China is not about to “rule the world,” as Martin Jacques’s 2012 book claims.60 China has made no progress toward establishing a worldwide military base system of U.S.-style power projection capabilities. The Chinese currency is hardly poised to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency.61 As David Shambaugh of George Washington University has argued, China is merely a “partial power.”62 The Pentagon has already initiated a major response to China in its strategic planning,63 prompting critics to publish articles with titles like “Who Authorized Preparations for War with China?”64 The second trap for critics of China is to misidentify its strategy to replace America. Although the strategy is secret, we have enough evidence to know what it is not. No serious Chinese scholar advocates the approach to conquest of Hitler or Stalin or Tojo. No ying pai hawk author ever raises a strategy of territorial expansion or global ideological domination. Instead, China’s hawks seem obsessed with books about America’s rise to world power, like Ambassador Warren Zimmerman’s First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power.65 As we have seen, the Communist Party School teaches that American trade and industrial policies enabled the United States to surpass both Britain and Germany, and the classic ying pai text On Grand Strategy praises American craftiness in exploiting World War II to push aside Europe and establish the current global order in 1945.66 Lessons from the Warring States era fit nicely with the lessons that China’s hawks have learned from the rise of the United States. In addition to the many books about America’s rise I described in chapter 8, the Communist Party School in Beijing uses at least three books to illustrate how the rising challenger successfully and peacefully persuaded the old hegemon to yield: Ann Orde’s The Eclipse of Great Britain, Aaron Friedberg’s The Weary Titan, and Lanxin Xiang’s Recasting the Imperial Far East.67 One nationally known Chinese scholar has even examined decisive moments in American diplomatic history from 1880 to 1914 to show how the United States soothed and reassured Great Britain in order to replace it as the leading world power. He admires how American strategy cleverly and deliberately eased an unsuspecting, war-weary Britain out of its global role.68 China’s admiring descriptions of American strategy often use Chinese strategic concepts, such as claiming that the United States is exploiting shi, using wu wei, and borrowing the strength of others. China imputes the use of these concepts to the United States, which is also pursuing its own marathon strategy today, as China sees it.</em></p>

<p><em>The third intellectual trap is relevant only to U.S. government officials. The American public is unaware of the extent of the covert cooperation between Washington and Beijing over the past forty years. There is a long history of Chinese support for U.S. clandestine activities, which in turn has convinced many U.S. officials to see China as a current and prospective partner. Our history of clandestine cooperation has prejudiced many American policymakers in favor of China’s hawks, who were responsible for implementing these covert programs. The first step, recognizing that there is a Marathon, may be the most difficult to take, but it is also the most important. America may fail to recognize the problem and may refuse to face the long-term scenario of China not only surpassing us but also growing to double and then triple the size of our economy, by 2049. Then China will have won, by default.</em></p>
