<p><em>What sort of person composed these strategies for perfection? The voice that emerges from the Oracle is not, as some have argued, an entirely cynical, Machiavellian one. Baltasar Gracián (1601-1658), a worldly Jesuit priest, felt undying hatred for human folly. But the Oracle insists on the perfectability of man and the capacity of goodness, assisted by art, to triumph over evil.3 It is true that in the Oracle perfection depends not upon religious revelation (God appears only rarely in these pages) but upon human resources and industry: attentiveness, mastery of one’s emotions, self-knowledge, and other forms of prudence. There is, however, nothing irreligious or overly “pessimistic” about this emphasis on human reason. It was, after all, from St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of his order, that Gracián learned aphorism 251: “Use human means as though divine ones didn’t exist, and divine means as though there were no human ones.” In the Oracle, Gracián has all but ignored “divine” means, aware of Ignatius’ advice and of the Spanish proverb it elaborates on: “Pray to God, but hammer away …”4 Gracián assumes, without saying so, that God helps those who help themselves.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 2 (location ~ 22-32)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Like other moralists of his age, from Francis Bacon and Jeremy Taylor to Francisco de Quevedo, Gracián labored painfully toward desengaño, the state of total “disenchantment” or disillusionment in which one gains control of one’s hopes and fears, overcomes deceitful appearances and vain expectations, and weans oneself from false worldly values. Much of the Oracle, with its insistence on curbing the imagination, concerns strategies for reaching that bittersweet beatitude. To entertain no illusions about things or people was a large part of wisdom. The modern notions of pessimism and optimism seem shallow in comparison. Optimism would have seemed out of place, anyway, in seventeenth-century Spain—the Spain of Velásquez and Zurbarán—a kingdom in social turmoil and political decline. Like Quevedo, Gracián had the sense that his country’s moral strength was waning. From time to time we hear a melancholy, unmistakably elegiac sigh: “Good conduct has departed, debts of gratitude now go unpaid, and few people give others the treatment they deserve …” (280). Only strategy—incessant plotting against one’s own weaknesses and those of others—allows us to push forward to perfection. “It takes more to make one sage today than it did to make the seven of Greece”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 3 (location ~ 46-55)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>There was even a small zoological garden: “in four caves, behind strong bars, were a tiger, a leopard, a bear and a lion. In a cage, two voracious ostriches.” To Lastanosa’s literary and cultural treasures, Gracián was granted access: an incalculable boon for one who thirsted for esthetic perfection and infallible taste, and hungered to “be vulgar in nothing” (28). It was Lastanosa who paid for the publication of several of Gracián’s books, and many of the aphorisms of The Art of Worldly Wisdom may have been tried out for the first time on listeners in his salon. The records of the Jesuits give us a glimpse of Gracián as priest and administrator, and he seems less stern, less forbidding in those pages than in these. In 1637, for example, he is rebuked for having been too lenient toward a fellow Jesuit guilty of “weakness” (flaqueza) with the opposite sex. A year later, the general of the Jesuit order suggests, from Rome, that Padre Gracián be reassigned: “… because he is a cross and a burden to his superiors, a source of problems and disturbances …, and because, displaying little prudence, he has been caring for the child of one who has left the order, asking for money to support him; and [also] because he has published a book, under the name of a brother of his.”</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 5 (location ~ 75-85)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Even Gracián’s style aroused animosity, and it continues to do so among those who have no time for brevity. He is one of the most laconic writers of the seventeenth century, a period when European humanists, heeding Justus Lipsius’ call for brevity, delighted in Seneca and Tacitus and lost their taste for copious Cicero. Many of Gracián’s stylistic habits are easy to recognize even in translation: antithesis and paradox; the constant use of ellipses; the concentration of meaning brought about by punning and other sorts of wordplay; the lack of connective tissue between one sentence—one point—and another (notice that there is often an abrupt transition between aphorism and commentary, and that the commentaries themselves often seem disjointed and fragmentary). These traits are more than idiosyncracies: they arise from a vision of human nature. The stylistic values reflected in these pages—wit, intensity, concision, subtlety—are also rules for wise living. For Gracián, living is a high art. Esthetic strategies correspond to moral ones. In other words, the author’s relations with the reader are analogous to the reader’s relations to those around him.11 The author fences with the reader, withholds his meaning, disguises his intentions, avoids putting all of his cards on the table, keeps matters in suspense, and uses obscurity to awaken admiration and reverence: the reverence due an oracle. “The truths that matter most to us,” Gracián writes self-reflectively, “are always half-spoken, fully understood only by the prudent” (25); “secrecy has the feel of divinity” (160).</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 8 (location ~ 108-120)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Spanish critic Gonzalo Sobejano once observed that they come upon us with the chaos of life itself, reproducing “the chaotic randomness of pure experience.”13 This is surely the best of authorial defenses: “it is easy to kill the bird that flies in a straight line, but not the one that changes its line of flight” (17). Not that the book itself is organized chaotically. Gracán’s approach is dialectical: as happens with popular proverbs, one aphorism offsets another, contradicting or complementing it, and moral phenomena are viewed from different perspectives. One fragment tells us how to perform a maneuver, another, how to defend ourselves from it. As for brevity, it too is both an esthetic ideal and a strategy for survival. Say less, and you—as author or reader—will be less likely to be discovered, contradicted, proven wrong. “Speak as though you were writing your testament: the fewer words, the fewer lawsuits” (160). And “good things, if brief, [are] twice good.” True, certainly, of translators’ prefaces!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 9 (location ~ 132-140)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Keep matters in suspense. Successes that are novel win admiration. Being too obvious is neither useful nor tasteful. By not declaring yourself immediately you will keep people guessing, especially if your position is important enough to awaken expectations. Mystery by its very arcaneness causes veneration. Even when revealing yourself, avoid total frankness, and don’t everyone look inside you. Cautious silence is where prudence takes refuge. Once declared, resolutions are never esteemed, and they lie open to criticism. If they turn out badly, you will be twice unfortunate. If you want people to watch and wait on you, imitate the divinity.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 13 (location ~ 195-199)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Make people depend on you. A god is made not by adorning the statue but by adoring it. He who is truly shrewd would rather have people need him than thank him. Vulgar gratitude is worth less than polite hope, for hope remembers and gratitude forgets. You will get more from dependence than from courtesy. He who has already drunk turns his back on the well, and the orange already squeezed turns from gold into mud. When there is no longer dependence, good manners disappear, and so does esteem. The most important lesson experience teaches is to maintain dependence, and entertain it without satisfying it. This can hold even a king. But don’t carry it too far, leading others astray by your silence or making their ills incurable for your own good.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 14 (location ~ 204-209)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Don’t outshine your boss. Being defeated is hateful, and besting one’s boss is either foolish or fatal. Superiority is always odious, especially to superiors and sovereigns. The common sort of advantages can be cautiously hidden, as beauty is hidden with a touch of artful neglect. Most people do not mind being surpassed in good fortune, character, or temperament, but no one, especially not a sovereign, likes to be surpassed in intelligence. For this is the king of attributes, and any crime against it is lèse-majesté. Sovereigns want to be so in what is most important. Princes like to be helped, but not surpassed. When you counsel someone, you should appear to be reminding him of something he had forgotten, not of the light he was unable to see. It is the stars who teach us this subtlety. They are brilliant sons, but they never dare to outshine the sun.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 14 (location ~ 215-221)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Associate with those you can learn from. Let friendly relations be a school of erudition, and conversation, refined teaching. Make your friends your teachers and blend the usefulness of learning with the pleasure of conversation. Enjoy the company of people of understanding. What you say will be rewarded with applause; what you hear, with learning. What draws us to others, ordinarily, is our own interest, and here that interest is ennobled. The prudent frequent the homes of courtly heroes: theaters of heroism, not palaces of vanity. Some are renowned for their learning and good judgment: oracles of all greatness through example and friendship. Those who accompany them form a courtly academy of gallant discretion and wisdom.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 16 (location ~ 237-242)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>15 Surround yourself with auxiliary wits. Things turn out well for the powerful when they are surrounded by people of great understanding who can get them out of the tight situations where their ignorance has placed them, and take their place in battling difficulty. It is singular greatness to use wise people: better than the barbaric taste of Tigranes,</em> who wanted to enslave the kings he conquered. This is a new way of mastering others, in what matters most in life: skillfully make servants of those whom nature made superior. We have little to live and much to know, and you cannot live if you do not know. It takes uncommon skill to study and learn without effort: to study much through many, and know more than all of them together. Do this and you will go to a gathering and speak for many. You will speak for as many sages as counseled you, and will win fame as an oracle thanks to the sweat of others. Choose a subject, and let those around you serve up quintessential knowledge. If you can’t make knowledge your servant, make it your friend.*</p>
<ul>
<li>Page 18 (location ~ 264-272)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>16 Knowledge and honorable intentions ensure that your success will bear fruit. When understanding marries bad intention, it isn’t wedlock but monstrous rape. Malevolence poisons perfection. When abetted by knowledge, it corrupts even more subtly. Superior talents given to baseness come to a bad end. Knowledge without judgment is double madness.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 18 (location ~ 275-278)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>19 When you start something, don’t raise other people’s expectations. What is highly praised seldom measures up to expectation. Reality never catches up to imagination. It is easy to imagine something is perfect, and difficult to achieve it. Imagination marries desire, and conceives much more than things really are. No matter how excellent something is, it never satisfies our preconceptions. The imagination feels cheated, and excellence leads more often to disappointment than to admiration. Hope is a great falsifier. Let good judgment bridle her, so that enjoyment will surpass desire. Honorable beginnings should serve to awaken curiosity, not to heighten people’s expectations. We are much better off when reality surpasses our expectations, and something turns out better than we thought it would. This rule does not hold true for bad things: when an evil has been exaggerated, its reality makes people applaud. What was feared as ruinous comes to seem tolerable.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 19 (location ~ 291-298)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>22 Be well informed. The discreet arm themselves with a store of courtly, tasteful learning: not vulgar gossip, but a practical knowledge of current affairs. They salt their speech with witticisms, and their actions with gallantry, and know how to do so at the right moment. Advice is sometimes transmitted more successfully through a joke than through grave teaching. The wisdom passed along in conversation has meant more to some than the seven arts, no matter how liberal.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 21 (location ~ 308-311)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>27 Better to be intensive than extensive. Perfection isn’t quantity, but quality. Very good things have always been small and rare; muchness brings discredit. Even among men, the giants are usually the dwarfs. Some praise books for their girth, as though they were written to exercise our arms, not our wits. Extension alone can never be more than mediocre, and the universal men who want to be in on everything are often in on nothing. Intensity leads to eminence and even—in matters of great importance—fame.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 22 (location ~ 335-339)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>29 Be righteous and firm. Side with reason and do this so steadily that neither vulgar passion nor tyrannical violence will make you stray from it. But where will we find such a Phoenix of equity? Few are devoted to righteousness. Many celebrate her, but few visit her. Some follow her until things get dangerous. In danger, the false disown her and politicians cunningly disguise her. She is not afraid to set aside friendship, power, and even her own good, and this is when people disown her. Clever people spin subtle sophistries and speak of their laudable “higher motives” or “reasons of security,” but the truly faithful person considers deceit a sort of treason, is prouder to be steadfast than clever, and is always found on the side of truth, If he differs with others, it isn’t because of any fickleness of his own, but because others have abandoned the truth.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 23 (location ~ 346-352)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Know when to put something aside. One of life’s great lessons lies in knowing how to refuse, and it is even more important to refuse yourself, both to business and to others. There are certain inessential activities—moths of precious time—and it is worse to busy yourself with the trivial than to do nothing. To be prudent, it isn’t enough not to meddle in other people’s business: you must also keep them from meddling in yours. Don’t belong so much to others that you stop belonging to yourself. You shouldn’t abuse your friends, or ask them for more than they give on their own initiative. All excess is a vice, especially in your dealings with others. With this judicious moderation you will stay in the good graces of others and keep their esteem; and propriety, which is precious, will not be worn away. Retain your freedom to care passionately about the best, and never testify against your own good taste.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 24 (location ~ 368-374)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Know your best quality, your outstanding gift. Cultivate it and nurture all the rest. All people could have achieved eminence in something if only they had known what they excelled at. Identify your king of attributes and apply it in double strength. Some excel at judgment and others at courage. Most people force their intelligence and achieve superiority in nothing. Their own passions blind and flatter them until—too late!—time gives them the lie.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 25 (location ~ 375-378)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>35 Weigh matters carefully, and think hardest about those that matter most. Fools are lost by not thinking. They never conceive even the half of things, and because they do not perceive either their advantages or their harm they do not apply any diligence. Some ponder things backward, paying much attention to what matters little, and little to what matters much. Many people never lose their heads because they have none to lose. There are things we should consider very carefully and keep well rooted in our minds. The wise weigh everything: they delve into things that are especially deep or doubtful, and sometimes reflect that there is more than what occurs to them. They make reflection reach further than apprehension.</em></p>

<p><em>36 Take the measure of your luck: in order to act, and in order to commit yourself. This matters more than identifying your predominant humor and understanding your physical makeup. It is foolish for a forty-year-old to ask Hippocrates for health, and even more foolish to ask Seneca for wisdom. It is a great art to govern Fortune, either awaiting her (for she sometimes takes her time) or taking advantage of her (for she sometimes turns good), although you will never completely understand her inconsistent behavior. If she has favored you, proceed with boldness, for she often loves the daring and, like a dazzling woman, the young. If you are unlucky, act not. Withdraw and</em></p>

</ul>
<p><em>Never exaggerate. It isn’t wise to use superlatives. They offend the truth and cast doubt on your judgment. By exaggerating, you squander your praise and reveal a lack of knowledge and taste. Praise awakens curiosity, which begets desire, and later, when the goods seem overpriced, as often happens, expectation feels cheated and avenges itself by running down the praised and the praiser. The prudent show restraint, and would rather fall short than long. True eminences are rare, so temper your esteem. To overvalue something is a form of lying. It can ruin your reputation for good taste, and—even worse—for wisdom.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 27 (location ~ 414-419)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>45 Use, but don’t abuse, hidden intentions, and above all, don’t reveal them. All art must be concealed, for it rouses suspicion, especially hidden intentions, which are hateful. Deceit is common, so be on your guard. But hide your caution from others, so as not to lose their confidence. When it becomes known, caution offends others and provokes vengeance, awakening unimagined evils. A reflective way of doing things will give you a great advantage. Nothing provides more food for thought. The greatest perfection of an action depends upon the mastery with which it is carried out.</em></p>

<p><em>48 You are as much a real person as you are deep. As with the depths of a diamond, the interior is twice as important as the surface. There are people who are all façade, like a house left unfinished when the funds run out. They have the entrance of a palace but the inner rooms of a cottage. These people have no place you can rest, though they are always at rest, for once they get through the first salutations, the conversation is over. They prance through the initial courtesies like Sicilian stallions, but immediately lapse into monkish silence. Words dry up when not refreshed by perennial springs of wit. Such people easily fool those who see things superficially, but not the sharp-sighted, who look inside them and find only emptiness.</em></p>

<p><em>49 A person of sharp observation and sound judgment rules over objects and keeps objects from ruling him. He plumbs the greatest depths, and studies the anatomies of other people’s talent. No sooner does he see someone than he has understood him and judged his essence. With rare powers of observation he deciphers even what is most hidden. He observes sternly, conceives subtly, reasons judiciously: there is nothing he cannot discover, notice, grasp, understand.</em></p>

<p><em>50 Never lose your self-respect or grow too familiar with yourself. Let your own integrity keep you righteous. You should owe more to the severity of your own judgment than to all external precepts. Avoid what is indecorous, not because others will judge you harshly, but because you fear your own prudence. Grow to fear yourself and you will have no need of Seneca’s imaginary witness.</em> <em>Your own conscience. Gracián is alluding to one of Seneca’s Moral Epistles.</em></p>

<p><em>51 Know how to choose. Most things in life depend on it. You need good taste and an upright judgment; intelligence and application are not enough. There is no perfection without discernment and selection. Two talents are involved: choosing and choosing the best. There are many people with a fertile, subtle intelligence, rigorous judgment, both diligent and well informed, who are lost when they have to choose. They always choose the worst, as though they wanted to show their skill at doing so. Knowing how to choose is one of heaven’s greatest gifts.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 31 (location ~ 473-477)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>52 Never lose your composure. Prudence tries never to lose control. This shows a real person, with a true heart, for magnanimity is slow to give in to emotion. The passions are the humors of the mind, and the least excess sickens our judgment. If the disease spreads to the mouth, your reputation will be in danger. Master yourself thoroughly and no one will criticize you for being perturbed, either when things are at their best or at their worst. All will admire your superiority.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 32 (location ~ 478-482)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>53 Be diligent and intelligent. Diligence is quick to carry out what intelligence has lingered over. Fools are fond of hurry: they take no heed of obstacles and act incautiously. The wise usually fail through hesitation. Fools stop at nothing, the wise at everything. Sometimes things are judged correctly but go wrong out of inefficiency and neglect. Readiness is the mother of luck. It is a great deed to leave nothing for the morrow. A lofty motto: make haste slowly.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 32 (location ~ 483-486)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>54 Act boldly but prudently. Even hares tweak the beard of a dead lion. Like love, courage is no joking matter. If it yields once, it will have to yield again, and again. The same difficulty will have to be conquered later on, and it would have been better to get it over with. The mind is bolder than the body. So with the sword: let it be sheathed in prudence, ready for the occasion. It is your defense. A weak spirit does more harm than a weak body. Many people with eminent qualities lacked this brio, appeared to be dead, and were buried in their lassitude. Provident nature resourcefully joined the sweetness of honey with the sting of the bee.

This delicacy is especially necessary when the person giving advice has something at stake. It is best to show good taste and to be more explicit only when insinuation is not enough.

They may give in later, but they aren’t well thought of because they started out by being so unpleasant. Refusal shouldn’t come in one fell blow. Let people nibble on their disappointment little by little. Never refuse something completely: others would no longer depend on you.

When you tell how those absent have favored you, you are asking those present to do the same, and pay in the same coin. The prudent person should never publicize dishonor or slights, only the esteem others have shown him. Thus will he have friends and halve his enemies.</em></p>

If it is a matter of giving, a gift is valued more highly when bestowed wisely than when given quickly. What was long desired is always more appreciated. If it is a matter of refusing, you can devote more attention to your manner, and let your “no” ripen a bit, so that it will not be quite so bitter. Most of the time, the first heat of desire will have died down, and it will be easier to accept refusal. If someone asks soon, grant late. This is a way of holding his interest.</em></p>

Those obstinate in deeds are in greater danger than those obstinate in words, for there is greater risk in doing than in saying. The vulgar ignorance of stubborn people makes them prefer contradiction to truth and contention to utility. Prudent people are on the side of reason, not passion, whether because they foresaw it from the first, or because they improved their position later.

Experts feel the tongue and quickly take the pulse of the mind. “Speak,” said the sage, “and you will be known.” To some the art of conversation lies in having no art at all, letting it fit loosely, like clothes. This may be true of conversation among friends. In more elevated circles, conversation should be weightier, revealing the great substance of the person. To converse successfully, you must adapt yourself to the temperament and intelligence of others. Don’t set yourself up as a censor of words—for you will be taken as a grammarian—and even less as a prosecutor of sentences—which will make others avoid you and keep you from communicating.

At other times you can give things a good name (but be sure to flee from affectation). Another trick is to offer something only to those in the know, for everyone believes himself an expert, and the person who isn’t will want to be one.

Difficult points require mature rethinking. The pillow is a tongueless sibyl, and it is better to sleep on something than to lie awake when things are on top of you.

A friend is all things, and friendship has the three qualities of anything good: unity, goodness, and truth.

Philosophers said that privation was nothing, and men of state say it is everything: the latter were right. Some people climb the steps of others’ desires to reach their own ends. They take advantage of the tight spots others are in, and use difficulty to whet their appetite.

<p><em>252 Live neither entirely for yourself nor entirely for others. It is a vulgar sort of tyranny. If you want to belong entirely to yourself, you’ll want everything for yourself. Such people don’t know how to yield, even in the smallest things, or give up even a tiny bit of their own comfort. They never win other people’s favor; they trust in their fortune, and acquire a false sense of security. It is good to belong to others at times so that others can belong to you. If you hold public office, you must be a public slave. Either bear the burden or give up the berth, as the old woman said to Hadrian. Some people belong entirely to others, for foolishness always deals in excess, and this is a very unhappy sort of excess. They have not a day, not an hour to call their own, so completely do they give themselves to others. This is true even in matters of understanding. Some people know everything for others and nothing for themselves. If you are prudent, you will understand that people seek you not for your own sake but for their own. What interests them is what you can do for them.</em></p>

<p><em>253 Don’t express your ideas too clearly. Most people think little of what they understand, and venerate what they do not. To be valued, things must be difficult: if they can’t understand you, people will think more highly of you. To win respect, make yourself seem wiser and more prudent than is required by the person you are dealing with. But do so with moderation. Intelligent people value brains, but most people demand a certain elevation. Keep them guessing at your meaning, and don’t give them a chance to criticize you. Many praise without being able to say why. They venerate anything hidden or mysterious, and they praise it because they hear it praised.</em></p>

<p><em>255 Know how to do good. A little bit at a time, but often. Don’t bestow more favor on someone than he can return. He who gives much doesn’t give; he sells. Don’t exhaust the gratitude of others. When grateful people are unable to respond, they break off the correspondence. To lose them, you have only to place them too greatly in your debt. When they don’t want to pay, they draw away, and turn into enemies. The idol doesn’t want to see the sculptor who carved him, and the person who receives a favor would rather lose sight of the person who did it. So learn this subtle lesson about giving: if the gift is to be appreciated, it should be much desired but cost little.</em></p>

<p><em>256 Be prepared. For the rude, the stubborn, the vain, and for all sorts of fools. There are many of them, and prudence lies in avoiding them altogether. Make a few resolutions each day before the mirror of your prudence, and you will fend off their attacks. Use some foresight, and don’t risk your reputation to vulgar happenstance. The person armed with prudence will not be attacked by folly. Human relations are full of sharp reefs where your reputation can run aground. The safest way is to change course, asking Ulysses for cleverness. This is where artful evasion comes in. And above all, use generosity and courtesy, the shortest way out of difficulty.</em></p>

<p><em>259 Foresee affronts and turn them into favors. It is wiser to avoid them than to avenge them. It is a great skill to turn a potential rival into a confidant. Those who would have attacked your reputation become its protectors. It is valuable to know how to place others in your debt and transform insult into gratitude. To turn sorrows into pleasures is to know how to live. Make malevolence itself your confidant.</em></p>

<p><em>262 Know how to forget. It takes more luck than skill. The things that should most be forgotten are the ones most easily remembered. Not only does memory behave basely, not coming forward when it is needed, it is also foolish, for it comes to us when it shouldn’t. It is prolix when it can give us pain, and careless when it can give us pleasure. Sometimes the best remedy for troubles is to forget them, but we forget the remedy. Let us train the memory and teach it better manners, for it can give us heaven or hell. Self-satisfied people never care about this—in their silly innocence they are always happy.</em></p>

<p><em>263 Many pleasant things are better when they belong to someone else. You can enjoy them more that way. The first day, pleasure belongs to the owner; after that, to others. When things belong to others, we enjoy them twice as much: without the risk of losing them, and with the pleasure of novelty. Everything tastes better when we are deprived of it; even someone else’s water seems like nectar. Having your own things diminishes enjoyment, and increases your annoyance: at having to lend them, or not lend them. When you have things, you are really maintaining them for others, and more enemies will benefit from them than friends.</em></p>

<p><em>265 Get those who depend on you into tough situations. A risky situation, at the right moment, has made many people into true persons: it is when you are drowning that you learn to swim. In this way many discovered what they were worth and how much they knew, and all this would otherwise have remained buried in timidity. Difficult situations give us the chance to win renown, and when a noble person finds his honor at risk, he can do more than a thousand others. This lesson (like so many others) was known very well by Isabel, the Catholic monarch, and to this timely favor, the Great Captain owes his renown, and many others their eternal fame. In this subtle way, she made great men.</em></p>

<p><em>266 Don’t be bad by being too good. You will be, if you never get angry. Those who feel nothing are not really people. They don’t always act that way out of insensitivity but often out of stupidity. To feel strongly, when circumstances call for it, makes you a person. Even birds poke fun at scarecrows. To alternate the bitter with the sweet shows good taste: sweetness alone is for children and fools. It is a great evil to be so insensible that you lose yourself by being good.</em></p>

<p><em>269 Take advantage of your novelty. You will be esteemed as long as you are new. Novelty pleases everyone because of its variety. Our taste feels refreshed. A brand-new mediocrity is more highly regarded than an extremely talented person to whom we have grown accustomed. When eminences mingle with us they age more quickly. And remember that the glory of novelty lasts little. In four days people will lose their respect for you. Take advantage of the first fruits of esteem, and as they flee, snatch whatever you can. Once the warmth of novelty has died away, passion grows cold, and pleasure turns to irritation. Never doubt that all things had their season, and passed away.</em></p>

<p><em>270 Don’t be the only one to condemn what is popular. There has to be something good about it, for it pleases so many, and—however inexplicably—is enjoyed. Eccentricity is always odious: when wrong, ridiculous. Scorn something that is popular and you’ll be scorned yourself, and left alone with your bad taste. If you don’t know how to find what’s good, hide your dullness, and don’t condemn things en masse; for bad taste is usually born from ignorance. What everyone says either is or wants to be.</em></p>

<p><em>271 If you know little, stick to what is surest in each profession. They may not consider you ingenious, but they’ll think you solid. The person who knows can take risks and indulge his fantasy, but if you take risks knowing nothing, you will fall voluntarily. Keep to the right; what is tried and tested cannot fail. For those who know little, the main highway. Whether you know or don’t, sureness is safer than eccentricity.</em></p>

<p><em>273 Understand the characters of the people you are dealing with in order to penetrate their intentions. When you know the cause, you know the effect. The effect tells us the motive. The melancholy person always forecasts unhappiness, and the gainsayer, faults. They think only of the worst, and, overlooking the good that is present, they announce the evil that is possible. The person swayed by passion cannot speak of things as they are: passion speaks in him, not reason. Each person speaks according to his emotion or his humor, and all are far from the truth. You should know how to decipher a face and spell out the lettering of somebody’s soul. Know that the person who is always laughing is a fool, and the one who never laughs is false. Be careful of the person who is always questioning you, either because he asks too much or because he carps and scruples. Expect little good from the person with a nasty face. These people like to avenge themselves on nature, because she honored them so little. A person is usually as foolish as he is beautiful.</em></p>

<p><em>274 Be charming. It is a wise sort of bewitchment. Let charm and courtesy capture the goodwill of others, and also their services. It isn’t enough to have merit if you don’t please others—this is what makes people praise you, and acclaim is the most useful instrument we have for ruling others. You are fortunate if others find you charming, but this must be helped by artifice, which works best when natural gifts are present. Charm leads to benevolence and, eventually, universal favor.</em></p>

<p><em>275 Row with the current, but preserve your dignity. Don’t always look grave or annoyed. It is a sort of courtesy. You must yield a bit of your decorum to win popular favor. At times you can take the path of the many, but do so without losing dignity: the person taken for a fool in public will not be taken for a wise man in private. More is lost on a day of joking than was won with years of total gravity. Don’t always be the odd man out. To be eccentric is to condemn others. And don’t be squeamish and oversensitive; that is for women. Even squeamishness in spiritual matters is ridiculous. The best part of being a man is to seem like one. Women can imitate masculine qualities, but men shouldn’t imitate women.</em></p>

<p><em>276 Renew your character with nature and with art. They say that one’s condition changes every seven years: let this change improve and heighten your taste. After the first seven years of life, we reach the age of reason; let a new perfection follow every seven years thereafter. Observe this natural variety and help it along, and expect others to improve also. This is why many changed their behavior or their estate, or their employment, and at times one does not notice until one sees how great the change has been. When you are twenty years old, you will be a peacock; at thirty, a lion; at forty, a camel; at fifty, a serpent; at sixty, a dog; at seventy, a monkey; and at eighty, nothing.</em></p>

<p><em>277 Display your gifts; show them off. There is a time for each one. Take advantage; no one can triumph every day. There are gallant people in whom what is little truly shines, and what is much shines bright enough to astonish. When you have both talent and a talent for displaying your gifts, the result is something prodigious. There are nations that know how to dazzle, and Spaniards do it better than anyone else. As soon as the world was created, there was light to show it off. Showing off satisfies, supplies what is missing, and gives everything a second being, even more so when it is grounded in reality. The heavens, which bestow perfection, encourage us to display our gifts. You need skill to do so; even what is most excellent depends on circumstance and isn’t always appropriate. Ostentation doesn’t work when it is done out of season. Nor should we show off in an affected way, for ostentation borders on vanity, and vanity on scorn. It should be exercised with moderation, so as not to turn into vulgarity, and among wise men, an excessive display of one’s gifts is not highly thought of. It often involves a certain silent eloquence, a bit of carelessness. Wise dissimulation is the best way to win praise, for privation awakens curiosity. It takes skill not to reveal all of your perfection at once, but to do so little by little, always adding a little more. Let one glorious occasion spur you on to another greater one, and the applause given to the first heighten expectation for the others.</em></p>
<ul>

<p><em>278 Don’t call attention to yourself. When others notice you doing so, your very gifts turn into defects and you will simply be left alone and criticized as an eccentric. Even beauty, if it is excessive, will harm your reputation. When it gives others pause, it is offensive, and disreputable eccentricities have the same effect, only greater. Some wish to be known for their vices, searching for new ways to discredit themselves. Even in matters of the understanding, excess produces pedantry.</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><em>286 Don’t go completely into debt with anyone and everyone. You will become a common slave. Some were born luckier than others; they can do good while others receive it. Freedom is more precious than the gift that makes us lose it. You should take greater pleasure in having many people depend on you than on depending on one person. The only advantage of having power is that you can do greater good. Above all, when you are given an obligation, don’t take it as a favor. Most of the time it is the cleverness of others that has placed you in that position.</em></p>
<ul>

<p><em>288 Adapt yourself to circumstance. Governing, reasoning, and everything else must be done at the right moment. Want to do something when you can, for time and opportunity wait for no one. Don’t live by generalities, unless it be to act virtuously, and don’t ask desire to follow precise laws, for you will have to drink tomorrow from the water you scorn today. Some people are so paradoxically impertinent that they demand that circumstances adapt to their own whims, and help them succeed, rather than the other way around. But the wise know that the polestar of prudence lies in adapting themselves to the occasion.</em></p>

<p><em>292 Let your character be superior to the requirements of the job, not vice versa. No matter how great the post, you must show you are greater. Deep talent grows even deeper, and more obvious, with each pursuit. The person with a narrow mind and heart will be easily caught, and eventually the weight of his duties will crush his reputation. The great Augustus was proud of heing a hetter man than a prince. Here is where one needs a lofty spirit, and well-grounded confidence in oneself.</em></p>

<p><em>293 Maturity. It shines in the outer man, but even more in his customs. Material weight gives value to gold, and moral weight gives value to a person. It is the decorum that accompanies one’s gifts, causing veneration. Composure is the façade of the soul. It isn’t the insensibility and stillness of fools, as silly people think, but a calm sense of authority. It speaks in wise sayings and deals in success. You are as much a true person as you are mature. When you stop hehaving like a child and begin to be grave you acquire authority.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Page 122 (location ~ 1857-1861)</li>

<p><em>294 Moderate your opinions. Everyone forms his ideas according to his own interests, and offers abundant reasons to back them up. In most people, judgment yields to emotion. It often happens that two people meet head-on, and each presumes he is right. But reason is true, and never has two faces. In such encounters, proceed with wisdom and caution. Sometimes take the other side, and cautiously revise your own opinion. Examine your motives from the other’s point of view. That way you will neither condemn him, nor justity yourself, so blindly.</em></p>

<p><em>299 Leave people hungry. Leave nectar on their lips. Esteem is measured in desire. As with thirst, it is good to allay it but not to quench it. The good, if little, is twice good. Things fall off sharply the second time arounnd. Bellyfuls of pleasure are dangerous: they cause even the most eternal eminence to be scorned. The one rule for pleasing: whet the appetite, keep people hungry. The impatience of desire will do more than the ennui of enjoyment, and waiting deepens our pleasure.</em></p>

<p><em>300 In a word, be a saint; that says everything. Virtue is a chain of all perfections, the center of all happiness. She makes you prudent, discreet, shrewd, sensible, wise, brave, cautious, honest, happy, praiseworthy, true … a universal hero. Three things make one blessed: saintliness, wisdom, and prudence. Virtue is the sun of the lesser world, and its hemisphere is a good conscience. It is so lovely that it wins God’s grace and that of others. There is nothing as lovable as virtue, nor as hateful as vice. Virtue alone is for real; all else is sham. Talent and greatness depend on virtue, not on fortune. Only virtue is sufficient unto herself. She makes us love the living and remember the dead.</em></p>
